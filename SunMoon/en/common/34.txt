Hang on, now. Gimme just a sec...
So the day has finally come that you're moving to Alola!
Alola is a region made up of several islands.
That could be the reason the region is chock full of nothin' but rare Pokémon, yeah!
All right, I gotta ask you some questions about yourself so I can introduce you to everybody!
So which photo should I use for your Trainer Passport?
You OK with the one you chose, yeah?
All right then, I'll let you spell out your name for me.
So, you go by <var>?
10-4, good buddy! I'll let everybody out here know you're on your way!
<var>!
Yeah, that's a name that hits you like a Thunderbolt outta the sky! Woo!
Can't wait to see you in person then, cousin!
<var>! Come help me with these boxes!
Yes
No
There's no shortage of cool Pokémon out here in Alola, either!
Such mysterious creatures!
You find 'em all over. In the grass, in the caves, in the sky and sea...
Here in Alola we love our Pokémon, and we depend on them heaps, too.
Some of us even battle with 'em, if we call ourselves Pokémon Trainers!
Hey there! Good afternoon!
Hey there! Good evening!
Rockruff! Can you wait until I'm done talkin' to play?!
