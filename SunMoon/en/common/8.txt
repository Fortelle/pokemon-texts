Vs. Recorder
A Vs. Recorder is a device that allows you to record battles such as Link Battles and battles at the Battle Spot and view them later. It also allows you to reenact your opponent from the data recorded in the Vs. Recorder and let you battle against the opponent.
You can make your Battle Videos recorded by your Vs. Recorder public, or search and view Battle Videos that are made public by other players. A Battle Video that is made public has a search code. Share the code with other people, and they can view the same video even if they are far away.
