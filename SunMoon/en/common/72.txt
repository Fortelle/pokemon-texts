You're going to give up on this shoot? You sure, zzt-zzt?
But you've taken some photos already, zzt! You sure want to give 'em up?
Zzzt! You can move the camera all around by using the Circle Pad! It's always a good idea to try looking at the world from all kinds of different angles! When the time is ripe and you've framed the perfect shot, press [0xE005] or the A Button, zzt! Each time you fire up the Poké Finder, you can take six pics before you run outta space.
The zoom function has been added, zzzt! Press up and down on the +Control Pad to change how far you zzzoom in or zzzoom out!
The zzzoom function on your Poké Finder has been powered up, zzz-zzt! But you can use it just the way as you have up until now!
The zzzoom function on your Poké Finder has reached its max level! Zzzzt! Now you can zzzoom up in as close as anyone can ever be to a Pokémon!
A Pokémon-calling button has been added to your Poké Finder! Who could resist a button like that? Tap the bottom screen and give it a try! Zzzt!
Yes
No
Mm-hmm!
Getting warmer.
Not bad.
That's the spirit!
Beautiful!
You're on fire!
Nice one!
Looking good!
Brilliant!
Fantastic!
Electrifying!
Bravo!
Operation Manual
Move the camera around by using the Circle Pad, then press [0xE005] or [0xE000] to snap a photo!
Press up or down on the +Control Pad to zzzoom in or out on your subject! It seems people really like it when your photos capture a Pokémon as big as possible. Give it a try for lots of likes! Zzzt!
If you press the Pokémon-calling button on your Poké Finder, you can catch the attention of nearby Pokémon! Zzzt! Though it doesn't always work. Guess some Pokémon are just too cool for you! Ha! And you can't slam it over and over again either!
Zrmm? Lookzzz like you're out of film!
