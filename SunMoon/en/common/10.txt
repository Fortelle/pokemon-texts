A Box is a place where you can deposit your Pokémon. You can also organize your Pokémon in Boxes. Access your Boxes from a PC at any Pokémon Center.
Your Boxes have three modes. Press the X Button to change between modes. The first mode is to organize your Boxes. You can switch Pokémon between your party and your Boxes. You can also change the order of Pokémon.
The second mode is to organize Pokémon's held items. You can give Pokémon items, switch items, and so on.
The third mode is to register Pokémon for your Battle Teams. Register Pokémon you often use in battle for your Battle Teams. You can have up to six Battle Teams and register the same Pokémon for multiple teams, so create various teams!
Press START or SELECT to change between operation modes. The red cursor is for normal Box operation. The blue cursor allows you to switch Pokémon one after another. The green cursor allows you to select multiple Pokémon at once.
Press the Y Button to switch to search mode. You can quickly search for Pokémon by Pokémon name, type, learned move, and more.
