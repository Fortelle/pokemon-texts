What is it, <var>? Do you need to leave so that you might prepare yourself better for my trial?
I understand. It's unfortunate, of course, but go prepare yourself so you can come try again.
Defeat the totem that is causing all that sea spray, and prove your strength to me. And...well, you may find that using Grass- or Electric-type moves will be to your advantage. Or you could always resort to using an X Sp. Def or two or perhaps a Dire Hit. Do not let your guard down. The totem is not to be trifled with.
So you're back, <var>... Though you bowed out of my trial once.
