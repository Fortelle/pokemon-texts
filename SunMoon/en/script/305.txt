Rain in Alola, huh... My skirt got a bit wet...
Looking out at the rain like this... reminds me of this one time when I was little.
I'd seen it in a movie... this man singing and dancing in the rain. It captivated me so much that I had to try it for myself. My mother spotted me out in the rain, and she was so shocked that she ran right out after me without even bothering to get an umbrella...
And then...she smiled... and she danced with me in the rain. Of course we both ended up catching cold. She let me sleep in her big bed with her. I was so happy that I kept waking her again and again, just to be sure it wasn't a dream...
But... then she changed. And all she would think about was the Ultra Beasts. And Null and Nebby... They both ended up suffering so much... and I couldn't do anything...
But you know what, <var>? Whenever I feel like there's nothing I can do, you seem to show up and...you do something. Every time, you've shown me that it's possible... to do something.
Even the first time we met... Nebby was being attacked, and all I could do was look on in horror...
And at Aether Paradise... all I could do was wait for you and the others to save me...
Whenever I'm in any sort of trouble, you're always there...
I...
Um... <var>? What are you going to do...once you finish your island challenge?

I don't know
It must be nice, knowing what you want to do. I really admire that.
Oh, thank goodness... It's such a relief to know that even someone like you feels unsure at times, <var>!
I think...I'd like to become a Trainer, too. And travel together with you, <var>...
I want to become a Trainer, and learn all the things you know, <var>...

Ah!
Maybe there really are good omens sometimes, wouldn't you say?
