Who are you, misterlady? Are you one of Sissy's friends?
It's a stranger! Who are you? Who are you?
Wow! An island challenge amulet!
Sissy isn't here! But I think she's coming home, soon.
Play with us till Sissy comes home!
OK
What?
Then I wanna have a battle! Let's do a moldy battle!
Meanie! Big, stinky meanie! Come on, play with us!
It's not a moldy battle! It's a Multi Battle! We'll have a Multi Battle!
Yeah, that. So what do you say? You ready, Mr. Trainer guiss Trainer lady?
You're on!
Not yet
Come on! Hurry up and get ready already!
Come on! You can't fight without enough Pokémon!
Wowzers! You are sure strong, Mr. Trainer guiss Trainer lady!
You might even be stronger than Sissy!
I'm home, girls.
Sissy!
Welcome home!
Oh! <var>? You came to visit with us?
Mr. Trainer guiss Trainer lady was playing with us!
HShe is really strong. Did you know that?
Well, thank you, <var>. For entertaining my little sisters so kindly.
Hey, Sissy! Sissy!
Who's probably stronger? You or this Trainer? Like, if you were REALLY trying?
Yeah, who?
Who's stronger? Are you stronger?
Well... I don't rightly know. <var> is definitely strong himerself.
But we wanna know who's stronger!
Battle himer!
It looks like I've got little choice... Once the girls have their minds set, they don't budge, no matter how hard you try.
Come on! Do it!
Battle! Battle!
If you don't mind, <var>, could I ask you for a battle? The truth is that I've also been wanting to see how we might compare in skill!
Sure!
Umm...
I know these girls would love to see us battle, so please come back anytime to take me on. And perhaps I should warn you... I am quite strong!
All right!
We knew you would do it!
Why don't we go out front, <var>? I would have some advantage battling inside the house, since I'm so familiar with the layout.
Go on! Beat himer, Sissy!
Show himer what you've got!
Shall we?
I have a responsibility to set a good example for my younger sisters, of course. But even more important than that...I have my pride as a captain! I will show you what a serious Lana can do!
I look forward to enjoying a no-holds-barred battle again you, <var>!
Phew...
No way! She lost! Sissy actually lost!
That's amazing! Mr. Trainer guiss Trainer lady is amazing!
<var>, that was fantastic! You and your Pokémon were perfectly in sync! It seems I was premature in thinking that my full power would be enough to defeat you.
The way that Lana looked in that battle seems to linger in your mind...
How boring! I can't believe Sissy lost! Poo. I'm going home.
Me, too! Gimme a piggyback ride!
Fine, fine... Let's all be getting back home. But I will not be carrying you! You can walk on your own two feet. What else do you think you have feet for?
Thank you again for playing with my sisters. ...Here. Please have this and use it if you think it might be helpful.
My father is expecting me to help on the boat, so I should be going soon. But you feel free to stay as long as you want, <var>. My home is yours.
Hey, strong Mr. Trainer guiss Trainer lady!
Hiya, Mr. Trainer guiss Trainer lady!
