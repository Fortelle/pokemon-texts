Tapu Koko is amazing, isn't it? I hope I can meet it again someday and thank it for saving Nebby...
Pew!
Me, too
Oh yeah?
It saved you as well, didn't it? And left you with that sparkling stone... even though you're a stranger to this place.
You know, <var>... it did save your life, too. And it even gifted you that sparkling stone... even though you're a stranger to this place.
Suppose it's time we get you kids home, yeah?
Then I suppose this is good-bye...
