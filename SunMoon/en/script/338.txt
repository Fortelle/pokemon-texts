Hey there, <var>! Woo, you've come a long way!
You've made it through all the trials and grand trials that make up the island challenge! Congratulations!
Thanks!
Aren't you cold?
I can't help but remember when you first chose your partner, yeah...
Naw, I'm fine! My soul burns hot, yeah—hotter than a Blast Burn even!
Just one thing left for you to do— take on the Pokémon League! This is where the real fun starts!
Hey now! Looks like you got the Legendary Pokémon Solgaleo on your side!
There's something I hope that Legendary Pokémon knows: This has always been the spot where we finish up the island challenge. We wanted to put our Pokémon League right up here, as close as we could get to the sun... to respect and honor you, Solgaleo!
Hey now! Looks like you got the Legendary Pokémon Lunala on your side!
There's something I hope that Legendary Pokémon knows: This has always been the spot where we finish up the island challenge. We wanted to put our Pokémon League right up here, as close as we could get to the moon... to respect and honor you, Lunala!
Mount Lanakila is where we've always finished up the island challenge. We built our Pokémon League right up here, as high into the heavens as we could get... to show our respect for our Legendary Pokémon and to honor it.
I still remember it like it was yesterday! I went all the way to Indigo Plateau, yeah, right to the Pokémon League headquarters... and I went right at them, cousin!
Those Gym Leaders in Kanto really messed my team and me up! But then I saw my team battling for me through it all, pouring their souls into their moves for me.
And then that last guy, that Dragon user in the cape...
Oh sorry! Enough about me—let's get you in there, yeah!
But before you head in, make sure you're good and ready. You won't be able to come back out.
