...Oh. Hello? Who are you?
I'm <var>
I'm Kiawe's friend
Oh, sure! I remember now. Sorry, I'm no good with names.
...You sure about that? How long have you known him then, hm? Ga ha ha! I'm just joshing you, kid. I like to see a kid with confidence. But I think I know who you really are. You're <var>, ain't you?
I'm Kiawe's old man. I'm glad he's made friends like you. You're the first-ever Champion in Alola, ain't you? And at that tender age even! That's quite the accomplishment, kid.
I reckon I ought to give you a little gift to help you celebrate becoming Champion, then.
Give that there to a Rhydon to hold, and then trade it with a friend. You'll see what happens. Course there are no Rhydon native to Alola, but if you ever find one, give it a try for me, eh?
That boy of mine was pretty happy to hear that you'd become Champion like that. I hope you'll stay friends with him. He may not look it, but he's always been a lonely child.
