Hey, you. Kid. Didja know that the Pok√©mon Raichu looks a bit different in Alola than it does in other regions?
I knew that
Does it?
Hrmph! You cheeky little thing! Be polite and at least act surprised!
Yeah, it does! I know, you're blown away, aren'tcha?
So then. I haven't actually gotten the chance to see one of these Alolan Raichu for myself... If you show me one, I'll give you something good.
That's it! Yeah, I get it! That's a Raichu, all right! The Raichu that I saw in Johto were real fine, of course, but this Alolan Raichu... It's fantastic, all right!
You're a nice kid, ain't you? I'll give something good, just like I said I would.
I think I could be mighty partial to these Alolan Raichu myself, you know!
Lipper!
