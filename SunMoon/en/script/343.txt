Hiya! Acerola here, bringing an old royal touch to the Pok√©mon League!
Nanu said maybe he can't refuse a tapu choosing him to serve as kahuna... But he'd be darned if he had to serve as one of the Elite Four just because some guy asked him! So I guess I'll just have to battle hard enough to make up for his not being here!
Phew! Well, there goes my hope of beating you to smithereens and becoming Champion myself!
Hey, even if you are the Champion, you can't go into the Champion's chamber without proving you can still get past the Elite Four! And besides...battling is just plain fun! Come on, I can take you!
Being in the Elite Four is fun, but so is being a captain... Hmm, I'm not sure which to do...
You've got three more Trainers to take on! Thanks for picking me to battle first, while you were still fresh and full of energy!
You have two more Trainers to take on! Are you getting tired? If you are, and you still are beating us, then I guess we've got quite a bit farther to go ourselves!
You've made it to third base! Now you've just got to bring it home! Or would this be second base? I don't really get baseball metaphors...
You've blasted right through the Elite Four! Well, first off, let me say congratulations! But don't lose your momentum now! Just keep storming ahead!
