Hello, darling... I brought you some flowers today.
Hyah!
Hyah! Hyah!
...What do you think, darling? They are lovely, aren't they?
Hyah! Hiii-yah! Hyah! Hyah!
Shhh, quiet now. There are many others resting in these plots.
Hiii-yah! Hyah hyah hyah!
Come now, dry those tears. We're all done with tears, aren't we? You and I. If we come here, we can see him again any time that we want to. And as long as we don't forget him, he will always be with us...
Hyah...
Hyah?!
Oh! Hello, young Trainer. I'm sorry for all of this one's noise.
Hyah!
This is my husband's grave. And this silly one here was his Pokémon.
Hyah! Hyah! Hiiii-yah!
It was...an accident. But my husband sent Machamp back into its ball at the moment of the crash. It was a miracle that Machamp survived. But my husband... Well, ever since the accident, Machamp here has hated being inside a Poké Ball. In fact it flung its own ball off somewhere.
Hi-yaaaaaahhh!
Of course I was devastated when my husband passed away. And there were times when I hated that other man, who caused the accident. But that man... He had a family, too. A young wife. When I saw her face, I just couldn't go on hating anyone for what happened.
Oh, I'm sorry... I didn't mean to say all that...
Thank you for letting an old woman ramble so. This belonged to my husband, but I'd be happy if you could use it.
Do you also use Ride Pokémon to get around? It is fun and quite convenient, but please do be careful not to get in any accidents. Take care, young Trainer.
Good night for today, darling... We'll come visit again tomorrow night.
