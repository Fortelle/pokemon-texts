Mm-hmm... Mm-hmm!
I know! Look at you! You look like a Pokémon Trainer with sense!
I've got something I'd like to ask a promising- looking Trainer like you!
What do you say?
I'm listening
I'd rather not...
Hmm... Hrmmmmmmm... Well, that is a real shame...
Oh! Oh, thank you! That's wonderfully kind of you!
You see, I'm here doing some research on various Pokémon. I need to record the differences between 10 species of Pokémon for my survey sample, but I've been working so hard and my back is just killing me...
But then you came along! You look like a sensible young Trainer, which is just the sort of person I need to help me! I'd like to ask you to catch 10 different species of Pokémon for me. It's not too much to ask, right?
Oh! But—! Oh, look at you! Already?! You've already caught more than 10 species of Pokémon! Then show me!
Oh, yes. This is perfect! This is all the data that I needed. Thank you!
Here. Why don't you take this? As a little thank-you for helping me out.
I'm really grateful for your assistance, my sensible young Trainer! I look forward to seeing what a promising young go-getter like yourself gets up to!
Good luck out there!
I want you to catch 10 different species of Pokémon for me. Any kind that you like. Just 10 different ones!
