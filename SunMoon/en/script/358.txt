You know, Lillie... Kanto is a long way away from here. Try not to let the jet lag hit you too hard.
Burnet's...well... she said she'd be too sad to watch you go, so she wouldn't even come out with me. I know it's a lot to ask, but forgive her this time, wouldja? She did tell me to let you know the loft in the lab is yours to use indefinitely.
So you can come back and stay whenever you like, Lillie!
You didn't tell us!
Hau... I'm sorry... But I've decided. I have to go to Kanto. To help my mother get better... but more than that...to help myself get stronger.
Of course I'm sad to leave Alola...
but...the thought of going to Kanto also fills my heart with excitement!
I'm going to become a real Trainer and meet all kinds of wonderful Pok√©mon... I'm going to travel all around Kanto, just like we did here on Alola for your island challenges!
And no matter what happens on my journey... I'm going to be OK.
Because of the smiles that you shared with me. You and <var> and everyone here... thank you all so much!
And that's why someday... someday I'll come back to Alola again!
But...but...I haven't gotten to say any of the things that I wanted to say to you! So...so... Arghhh!! I'm gonna send you a letter! A really, really long one! You'd better wait!
I will, Hau. And please...take this.
<var>... it may look a little worn, but...that is because this was my most treasured belonging once.
Then I suppose...this is good-bye.
