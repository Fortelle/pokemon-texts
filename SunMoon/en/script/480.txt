She's no Trainer, yeah, so I don't think she could have gone too far on her own...

I happened to pass under a moving shadow and got attacked by wild bird Pokémon! What adorable little pests they are!

Seeing kids like you journeying together with your Pokémon really soothes my soul... Thank you. I think I'll give you something!
A Pokémon will feel even friendlier toward you if you give it that Soothe Bell to hold. Its clear chiming sound is so pleasant.
