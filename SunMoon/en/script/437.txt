What in the world is the secret of the pond in this garden?
Oh! Listen to this! I've finally figured out the secret of the pond in this garden! If you could see this whole garden from above, the pond here would look like a Pokémon! How about I give you a little quiz? What kind of Pokémon does this pond look like?
Yungoos
Spinda
Pikachu
Crabrawler
Wingull
Mareanie
Gyarados
Pyukumuku
Sharpedo
I don't know
Don't just say you don't know and give up! Why don't you try walking around the pond?
No way! You're way off... Why don't you go have a good look at the pond?
Bingo! That's it! Give the boygirl a prize! You got the right answer! The pond in this garden is totally shaped like a Gyarados! And to reward you...I'll give you something nice!
And that's the end of our quiz! Gone as quick as an Air Balloon pops! Maybe I shouldn't have made it a multiple- choice quiz, after all. It was way too easy!
I wonder if whoever designed this garden really loved Gyarados or something? Maybe there's some really deep meaning to it!
