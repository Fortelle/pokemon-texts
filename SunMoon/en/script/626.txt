Using Sharpedo Jet can even break boulders... I wonder which would come out on top if Tauros and Sharpedo were to go head to head?

Ninny ninny ninny!

My Spinda's spots have got to take top spot. The scattering of faint spots on a field of fur... I could feast my eyes on them all day!
If you want to know which Spinda has the best spots here, there's no way to put any spin on it. It's obviously this one here on the right! Look how deep and rich the coloration is! And the positioning...it's positively art!
The nectar that lets Oricorio change forms is a bit different from one meadow to the next. I wonder what an Oricorio would look like if they tried some of Ula'ula Meadow's nectar?
Mag mag mag...
