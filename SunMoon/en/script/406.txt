Szz...
There is something written on his chest... "I'm just a poor Hypno. Share some love." The eerie Hypno keeps on staring at you...
Ignore him
Give him $1
Give him $100
Give him $1,000
Bah!
Hmph!
Zzz.
Wowzers! You're really giving me this?!
It looked like a Hypno, but it's actually just a person wearing a Pokémon costume...
Look at you, big spender! I figured someone might give me money if only I pretended to be a Pokémon, but I had no luck... until now, that is! You're the first big donor I've had! A shining example of humanity! I'm so touched that I've got to do something to pay you back for this. Here, take this!
Rest seems like a good move for a Hypno, right? I won't give you back your money, of course, but I'd be happy to let you have that!
Now, I guess I'd better get back to work! I can't get anything if my cover is blown, so don't you talk to me no more either!
Szz... (Shoo! Leave me alone!)
