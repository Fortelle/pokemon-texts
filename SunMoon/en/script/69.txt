Greetings! Captain Ilima here.
I couldn't help but observe your battles. You looked so very delightful in battle that I had no choice but to summon you here.
This is <var>, who moved here to Alola from the Kanto region. HShe's got a real sense for how to use moves, and I think she's gonna go far as a Trainer, yeah!
I see! Then welcome, newcomer. I look forward to seeing the brilliance of your moves in my trial.
Indeed! We captains are the ones who conduct the trials you will face on your way to challenging the island kahuna.
My trial is held in Verdant Cavern. The trial of Captain Ilima.
You can find Pok√©mon living everywhere, even in the patches of tall grass in Hau'oli City. Perhaps you'll want to fill out your team a bit before attempting my trial?
I sincerely look forward to your challenge.
Oh yeah!
I reported to the folks upstairs about that Tauros blocking the road out front again.
That guy's Tauros is pretty much a celebrity here on Melemele, you know?
Well, I guess it's time that we dismiss you from school, <var>.
Attention, all students... <var> has completed hiser lesson at the Trainers' School!
