Delicious food disappears in no time because it all gets eaten in a flash! But then it stays around in your stomach too long and you feel way too stuffed... But wait... Is it still even food at that point? Once it's in your stomach? At what precise moment does food stop being food and turn into...something else?! ...Ahem. Anyway. What I wanted to say is that this floating restaurant has the best food!
Bwo-moo!
