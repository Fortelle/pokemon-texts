This is where we look after the Pokémon that are commonly known as "regional variants."
There are several species of Pokémon that seem to have adapted to the Alola region. They have different appearances, and even types, in Alola than they do in other regions.
What is it in the climate and features of this region that is affecting the Pokémon? We are trying to determine that by testing different parameters such as the local soil, water, and temperature.
We've been aided in our research by Professor Oak, who is in Ula'ula, among others...
Oh yeah, I remember! The Meowth in your house is different from the ones in Alola, isn't it, <var>?
Yeah
It is?
So that's why! I never knew that Alola was so cool like that. Regional variants, huh?
Ha ha ha! OK, next time we're back home, <var>, we should compare Meowth!
Let me show you the next area.
If you'd like to meet President Lusamine, she's here in the conservation area now.
Wow, there are even Pokémon that got done in by Team Skull, huh?
