The unidentified creature disappeared...
So, it's true... I still need that Pok√©mon. I need to get it back.
What? Miss Lusamine, did you say something?
That creature we just saw was undoubtedly an Ultra Beast... An unknown being from another dimension that suddenly appears from the Ultra Wormhole...
It looked like it was suffering... Like it pained it to be in this strange place... I can't bear to see that happen! I will save it. And I will love it!
Thank you...both of you... Thank you so much!
