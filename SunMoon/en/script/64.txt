If you talk to the woman at the counter, she can restore your Pokémon to perfect health.
It's amazing, isn't it? I can't stand seeing Pokémon in pain...
You can also deposit Pokémon in the PC here or take them out.
And at the Poké Mart you can buy all kinds of items that should help you during your trials. I'd take a look, if I were you.
Over there is the café area.
I like to relax there sometimes with a frosty glass of Moomoo Milk.
I read something in a travel guide about Alola once... Apparently each Pokémon Center in Alola offers a different selection of drinks. I wonder how they pick what to serve?
The cafés may also offer more than just drinks. I've heard they also sell special treats and that sometimes the staff have tips for trial-goers.
Pew!
We should head to the Trainers' School next. But have your Pokémon taken care of first if you think that they need a little aid.
