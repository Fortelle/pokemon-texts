Yo, yo, yo!
It's your Berry thief boys, back...back again! Remember us?
Sure, I do
Sorry, who are you?
Whoa! Even though we look identical? That's pretty impressive, actually!
Oh, I see...
Just 'cause we switched places, you can't tell who we are anymore?!
Who cares about that anyway?! We're here to mess hiser trial up, yo!
Oh yeah, that's right! Yo, let's get that Pokémon, homie!
What's up with that?
For real, though?! I can't get my skull around it! This kid's mad strong, yo!
Naw, it ain't even like that. This kid is straight up dangerous, homie!
I don't know, man... Isn't this whole place trouble?!
Yeah! It totally is, homie! I mean, that thing is so strong that regular Pokémon don't even wanna come out and battle!
Yo, kid! You know there's a mad strong Pokémon lurking back here somewhere, right? I'd run if I were you.
Naw, we're not going out like that! We gotta get our revenge! Go stand over that den and catch that skulking <var>, yo!
For real?! Fine! I got no bones to pick with you!
Yo, you think maybe all these dens are, like, connected or something? If they are, and we park our bones right here, then nobody'll come out these holes, right?
Yo, yo, yo! Come on out! I'm gonna make you man enough...or, uh, 'mon enough to take on that big ol' boss inside!
Yo, yo, yo, homie! You giving up already?!
Yo, I'm over this! I'm out!
