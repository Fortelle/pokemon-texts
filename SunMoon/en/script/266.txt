Intruder spotted! We'll protect our secret labs!

There are only researchers like us here in the secret labs!
Looks like I'm next! I'll show you the power of Aether Paradise!

We're currently working on the development of a new Poké Ball. It is apparently to be used to catch Pokémon not found in Alola!
How about I guess what you're looking for? Cosmog, right? If you want to know what kinds of experiments we did with it, then you'll have to beat me!

All I can tell you is that Cosmog is the key. It's the tool needed to open the Ultra Wormhole. But I'm no good at battling. So I'm out of here!


It's not here...
Don't even think about getting in here.
Me and Null... We're more alike than we might look. We're both what we were made to be...
I was like an ornament to my mother. Wearing whatever she told me to wear, acting however she wanted me to act...
Null was crafted just as carefully. It was made just to battle the beasts. In this room...right here...
Just...just leave it alone. Did you check out the other lab?
