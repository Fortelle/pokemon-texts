You got a lame bunch of Berries... Now Team Skull's your adversaries! Takin' Berries off your hands is just the start of our plans, yo!
Let's get Figy with it! Watch while I Nanab me some Berries!
I'll share my Berries for free with any Pokémon, but you'll not have a single one from me!
So, what? I'm lower than a Pokémon?! I already got self-esteem issues, man!
And what are you looking at, huh?! Huh? Huh? HUH? Yo, hold up, you're—!
You got a bone to pick with us, homie? You and Cap may have beat us at the Marina, but you won't be so lucky if we get serious, yo!
I appreciate your concern, child. But these Team Skull punks do nothing but talk big and act small. You carry on with your island challenge. Don't give them a moment's notice.
Yo, we're standing right here! At least act a little bit afraid or something, y'know?!
Yo, you tryin' to run away? We're gonna hafta take your Pokémon along with the Berries!

Yo, check out how hardheaded Team Skull Grunts can be!
Yo, for real?! You best stop trying to act hard, kid! Yo, I'm so annoyed right now, homie! Let's go mess with Ilima again!
Aww yeah, let's do it! Verdant Cavern is pretty close by anyway. And you! You better listen to what my boy says and drill it into that thick skull of yours! For real! You'd better not forget, numskull!
Brrr!
