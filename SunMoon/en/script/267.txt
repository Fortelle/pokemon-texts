Wh-what are you kids doing in here?! Don't touch anything with your grimy hands!
This research is our life! I don't care if you're a kid or what. I'll send you flying if you threaten it!
I may be an expert at studying Pokémon, but I'm no expert when it comes to battling them.
But the guys in Lab A next door... They're pretty experienced with battles. After all, they spent so long researching that uncontrollable Pokémon...
Hey. Focus, people. Where're Lillie and Cosmog?
We may have lost, but that doesn't mean we're going to help you. I'm not telling you anything.
She's not here, is she? Even you can see that.
Come on, <var>! Let's split up and look around. Maybe we'll find some clue!
Come on, <var>! At least help me look around, would ya?
Aether Report: Ultra Wormholes Beyond the Ultra Wormholes that Professor Mohn discovered lies a different dimension. By investigating the changes in mass there, we can predict the existence of Pokémon-like life. We have dubbed them Ultra Beasts for now.
Aether Report: Cosmog Cosmog is hypothesized to be a type of Ultra Beast that hails from another dimension. A dimension that we have named Ultra Space. When placed under sufficient stress, it reveals the power to create and open Ultra Wormholes in order to escape from its suffering. We are now working on a device that will allow us to manipulate the Ultra Wormholes created when Cosmog is subjected to extreme stress...
Wait... So Cosmog might be an Ultra Beast?
We should tell Gladion about this!
