Welcome back, <var>! I can check your pictures right away. Now let's see how you did...
Yup! That's Mimikyu all right! It's pretty hard to catch it on film, so this is a really great attempt! Which means...
You received a Z-Crystal from Acerola!
You obtained a Ghost-type Z-Crystal! The Ghostium Z is yours!
If you want to use a Ghost-type Z-Power, then you've got to move like this!
And since you passed my trial, <var>, you now have my permission to catch Pokémon in the trial site. So, in that old building there. Here you go!
It's not a bad idea to have some Ghost-type Pokémon on your team!
What's that? You say the Poké Finder just started up on its own, during your trial? Oooh, cut it out, <var>! You're trying to scare me, huh? You'll have to come up with something a bit more believable than that! There's not even any room in the back of that shop, for starters! How gullible do you think I am?
Brrr! I feel like I'm getting chicken skin... Like a chill going through me for some reason...
