You'll find Brooklet Hill at the end of Route 5. That's where Captain Lana does her trial.
These Sudowoodo have seemed kinda down ever since Lana beat them, but they're blocking the path and now no one can go through. Seems like they're so petrified of Lana now that they don't even want to see another Waterium Z after she smacked down on them with that Water-type Z-Power of hers!
Hey! Looks like you passed Lana's trial, huh? Why don't you show these gloomy Sudowoodo your Waterium Z and see what happens!
Ha ha! The Sudowoodo were off like a flash once they were reminded of that Z-Power! Thanks! Now everyone can use the road again. Here's a little something in return for you!
I wonder if maybe those Sudowoodo ran off to the Battle Royal Dome to try to get stronger... You know about the Battle Royal Dome, right? That's the place where you enter Battle Royals!
So?
Woooooohhhhhh!!
The strange trees did not attack you, but went running off toward the Battle Royal Dome!
Everyone who works on the ranch loves a good Pokémon battle!
