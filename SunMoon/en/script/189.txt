I never thought I'd actually get to see the Ultra Wormhole in my life... We've gotta tell Professor Burnet about this the next time we see her!
I don't know if what happened should be rightly described as an accident, but... I think it's probably best if you do so. Anyway, I was very glad to get to meet you both. Please take this to remember your visit. Some malasadas for Hau...
Yes! Big Malasadas! Awesome! Isn't it crazy how malasadas taste even better when you eat 'em together with someone else?
Yes... I think I know what you mean. Meals always taste better when you share them with the ones you love. And for you, <var>. A TM for the move Psychic...
I hope you both have wondrous adventures on your island challenge.
We will! Thanks, Ms. Wicke!
