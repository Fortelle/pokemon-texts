<var>! Over here.
You know... I was really impressed seeing how you battled with your Pokémon at the Trainers' School...
And even back when you weren't yet a Pokémon Trainer, <var>... you were able to save Nebby... You were chosen by your Pokémon so quickly... I understand why now.
Oh! I forgot about Tauros!
