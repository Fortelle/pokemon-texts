Eggcellent! Since you're here, let me show you something!
Shiny Exeggcute! Golden, shining Exeggcute! All six of them glitter so eggcellently!
I'd love to share one with you, but even though they look like six Exeggcute, they are just one! But if I can't give you one of my shiny gold Exeggcute, these should be close enough!
I've heard that Exeggcute in Alola evolve with some kind of stone. But I'm afraid that Nuggets don't ever evolve into Big Nuggets, no matter what you do...
