Greetings. Captain Ilima here.
And my trial...
begins mere steps from here in Verdant Cavern!

Note that the Pok√©mon living within Verdant Cavern are quite fierce. I wouldn't venture in unless you've prepared some Potions and so forth.
Through attempting the trials during the island challenge, one can exceed his or her own limits. ...That is what the Alolan people believe.
Once you enter Verdant Cavern, you will not be able to leave until you have completed the trial. Are you prepared for the trial?
I'll be waiting for you!
Please make your preparations. I'll be waiting for you!
