Everything that we experience in our lives is connected to our Pokémon... That is what Kahuna Hala teaches us.
That cute Pokémon might look like it's here to help out or something, but don't be fooled. It's here to snag leftovers from the café! And it's a lot stronger than you might think.
Grrr?
What happens to a Pokémon's consciousness when it's been put into a PC Box? To be conscious you must be awake and aware of the world around you, wouldn't you say? But are Pokémon awake when they are in a PC Box or are they sleeping? I wish I could go into a Box to find out...
Wh-whi...?
