Greetings, <var>.
Well met! I was seeking you. If you're going to travel about Ula'ula, you ought to do it while astride a Mudsdale. There is no call for hesitation. Consider it my thanks for Akala Island.
Mudsdale was registered to your Ride Pager!
It was remiss of me not to register her for you when we met one another in Malie. I was just so taken aback by Lillie and how lovely she was that it escaped me. By no means was I just waiting for a time when you were in trouble!
Ni-hiii!
If you seek the next trial, go straight on through here to Tapu Village. I'll be cheering for you on your island challenge!
