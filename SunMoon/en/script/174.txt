Aue! You're Kahuna Olivia! I'm Hau from Iki Town! You've gotta let me battle you!
Oh, hey, <var>! Guess what? This weird green guy from Aether told me to come to Hano Grand Resort once I finished up with my grand trial here on Akala. Crazy, right?
Ooh, the Aether Foundation? I'm not sure what he wants with you, <var>, but why not go find out? If you don't want to keep him waiting, then Charizard should get you there in no time. The Hano Grand Resort lies just over the bridge near the Dimensional Research Lab.
Th...the Aether Foundation...?
U-um! I think I'll stay here. I'd like to see how Hau's battle goes, too. Even though I hate to see Pokémon get hurt... But I know that both of your Pokémon are dedicated to battling beside you two.
I may not be as strong as my gramps, Hala... But I can still raise up <var> and the rest of my team to do their best!
You're just Hau, right? And what's wrong with that! Who cares if you're Hala's grandson? Now show me what Hau can do!
