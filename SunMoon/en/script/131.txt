Very well done, <var>! Please come back this way.
I...I must say that I find myself at an impasse here. All of the Wishiwashi that I so diligently trained up were defeated, and that is very frustrating... but of course I cannot let your completion of my trial go uncelebrated, <var>.
You were amazing, <var>. Truly impressive. Please take this.
You do know what this is, don't you? Watch. This is how you use Waterium Z.
And that's not all I can offer you. Here. This is a Lana original. One of my own handmade fishing rods.
This is how you use my fishing rod: When you want to fish for Pokémon, look for piles of rocks in the water. Fish like to hide in the shadows there. When you see your bob dip under the water, you have a bite. But you won't for long. The Pokémon will struggle to get away, so press [0xE000] as soon as you see the "!" mark.
If you want to catch any of the Pokémon you fish up for your team, I recommend Dive Balls.
By the way... Did you know I once reeled in a red Gyarados?
You did?!
Did you really?
Well, what do you think?
You did a fine job today. Shall I see you back to the Pokémon Center on Route 5?
Good. Let's be going then. And you can always do a spot of fishing later.
I understand. Oh yes, I understand all too well. The siren call of the sea... and the urge to fish up something wonderful!
