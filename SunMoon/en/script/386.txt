When you're out traveling the world, you meet all kinds of people and Pokémon. Wanna try taking Aerodactyl, a Fossil Pokémon, along with you on your travels?
Aerodactyl is a fast Pokémon. I wonder how you'll use its speed in battle.
Your party and your Boxes are full?! I can really feel your love for Pokémon!
Well, if you do decide you'd like to battle alongside Aerodactyl, come let me know!
Aerodactyl is a Rock and Flying type. Olivia uses Rock-type Pokémon, and her skills are no joke! I wonder if there's anybody out there who uses Flying-type Pokémon that well...
