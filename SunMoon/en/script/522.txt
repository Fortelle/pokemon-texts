Hey, you... Do you know about the Totem Pokémon?
That's amazing! So you already went through the trial, huh?
That's not surprising! Do your trial and you'll find out what a Totem is.
You want a tip? OK, use a move that's the same type as your Pokémon. That way you can do extra damage.


If you give your Pokémon medicine in Pokémon Refresh, you can cure its poisoning or whatever else might be ailing it. What a refreshing boon!

This is awesome! We can trade Pokémon in no time at all using Quick Link!
I really want your Psyduck! Come on, let's trade again!
