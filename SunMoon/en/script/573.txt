Good day, and welcome to the Tide Song Hotel.
You can fit absolutely anything inside of a Trainer's Bag, huh! If it was me, I'd sure like to tuck myself in a Bag and tag along on someone's adventure!
All right! Time to visit the ranch next! I've just got to cut through Paniola Town!
Cor! Cor!
Staaahhh!
The ocean breeze dances over Heahea on the day I spend with you. ♪ The blue roofs stretch on unbreaking, as endless as the sea itself. ♪ The Lumineon dance upon the waves, our cheeks flame like the setting sun. ♪ Come here to hear the song of sea, Come here to hear the song of life. ♪ I wait to welcome you anytime... Come to the Tide Song Hotel! ♪
It's a photo from the day the hotel opened.
It's a painting of a kind of flower that some Pokémon love.
It's a painting showing how the Rendezvous Pokémon, Luvdisc, swims under the setting sun.
It's a scene showing the Float Whale Pokémon Wailord's impressive talent for high jumps.
I'd love to have such a lovely lady teach me all kinds of things about the Alola region.
Oh, you...! Are you trying to lower my Attack like some Pokémon using Charm?
Now that's something you don't see every day... Isn't that a Rotom Dex? It shows you lots of details about a Pokémon's distribution if you zoom in on the map, right?
Oh! <var>... I'm sorry... I saw some people who looked like those Team Skull thugs and I got scared. I was trying to avoid them and then I think I ended up missing my meeting... Oh! But don't worry. It's fine. This is actually where I wanted to be... Will you be going for another one of your trials, <var>? From what I've read, I think that the nearest trial site must be the one up Route 4.
It's the waiting list for tables at the restaurant. Let's see. Most of the people on the list have been waiting for...up to ten years?!
