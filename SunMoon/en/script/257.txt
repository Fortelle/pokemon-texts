Did I hear that right? It was Lillie who took Cosmog?!
Geh! You know who Lillie is?!
And you all are so useless and weak that now Cosmog is... Lillie is... Arghhh! I'll show you how angry you make me!
That was wrong of me... I shouldn't have dragged you into a meaningless battle like that...
But I told you both! I told you that Cosmog would bring disaster to all of Alola! I have to get it back from them!
We'll leave from the ferry terminal. You're coming with me whether you like it or not, so the only question is, are you ready to come now or not?
Good... Then let's go.
I'll wait for you near the Ula'ula ferry terminal. Don't make me wait long.
<var>... What should we do? Even if I go to the ferry terminal, too... What if I just get in you guys' way? What if I really am just this weak?
Can I trust you two to go and save Lillie? Every time I leave, Team Skull attacks this place. I have to protect these kids!
That was scary...
What happened to Miss Lillie?
Kew...
