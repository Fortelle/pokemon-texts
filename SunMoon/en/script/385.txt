I am Mr... Mr... I can't remember... I am just the ashes left behind... What remains when everything has been given...
I can't remember any longer... Not how to get back home... Not anything about who I once was...
But in the depths of my memory, I can still see the form of that dear Pokémon... As hazy and distant as a mirage...
It looked...like the sun... My...Sol—
It looked...like the moon... My...Luna—
Ach!!!
Oh... Ohhhh... Yes...
That <var> you journey with...
It's been...30 years...but...
Solll...
Naaaah...

A mysterious power began to emanate from your <var>!
Oh... Ohhhhhh. OH!
I've remembered... I've remembered everything! How to return home at last... And who I am!
Thank you, <var>... And do not worry. Those star pulses that you bestowed upon me 30 years ago have all been made safe. I entrusted them to a group of wonderful men.
Thank you, young manlady... I think I can go home now... Thanks to the power of your <var>.
Back to space!
Here... This is my thanks. I hope you will take it, without holding back, together with my thoughts and wishes.
I will never forget...the people of this world.
And now...I think I'll see myself out.
Fare thee well!
Hm...? ... ... ...
That Pokémon you journey with... It is Sol... Solgaleo?
That Pokémon you journey with... It is Luna... Lunala?
No... That's not it... It's all wrong...
Where is it? The Pokémon that always protected me? That round body... That rugged form... Those sharp, burning eyes...
Where is it? The Pokémon that always held me close? That curved body... That perfect arc... Coming to the most exquisite points...
If only I could see it once more... I think...I might remember something...
