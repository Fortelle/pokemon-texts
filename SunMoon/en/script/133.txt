Ni-hiii!
You there, Trainer. Can you come to my aid?
Over here.
Yo, yo, yo! Don't go turning your backside on us!
And YOU! You're that numskull Trainer from Melemele, yo!
These scoundrels are Pokémon thieves. And you're on familiar terms with them?
Well, yeah, I know them
I don't know who they are!
Yeah, that's right, you do!
Yo, for real?!
I am Hapu.
Life in the big city sure is something else. Pokémon thieves roam about brazenly...
Hmm, I leave that one to you.
We're not thieves, yo! It's a legitimate business!
We got straight messed up in Melemele... got exiled to Akala... but we ain't goin' out like that!
With all these losses, we're gonna anger our bosses! These tears taste like salt, yo! It's all your fault, yo!
Floooon?
Ne-hiiiiii!
Mudsdale, shall we stomp these scoundrels? It'll be a mess to clean up afterward, but I am willing if you are.
Time for us to break out, yo! Gotta tell y'all peace out, yo!
I'm not gonna keep telling you this... except when I keep telling you this! You better listen to what my homie says and drill it into that thick skull of yours! Seriously! You'd better not forget, numskull!
You'll be fine getting home?
Floo-oooon...
Glad to see that one will get home on her own.
I've got you to thank for that. Give me your name, Trainer.
<var>, eh? That's a fine name. I like the way you handled yourself in battle.
Mudsdale and I are always wandering all about Alola to try to achieve our goals, so perhaps we'll meet again someday. I am indebted to you for your aid, after all.
Ni-hiii!
Ah yes. You might want to try your hand at a Battle Royal or two, <var>. Mudsdale here thinks you'd be well suited to it, given how strong you are.
