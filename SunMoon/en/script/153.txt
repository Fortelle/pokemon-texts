Whoa! S-spectacular! With your keen observations, you were able to see even fine differences in our dances! And you defeated the Totem Pokémon with such ease!
The Totem Pokémon was carrying a Firium Z. It is yours now.
This is how you use the Fire-type Z-Power!
Thank you, my dear Marowak!
For when you meet a Pokémon that you would like to make your companion, take these!
What's more! You may now use the Ride Pokémon Charizard. Charizard will lend you his strength, and you will be able to go anywhere you have been in an instant.
Charizard was registered to your Ride Pager!
The Firium Z...you should show it to the Trial Guide outside the captain's barricade at the bottom of the mountain. It is time for us to return to our dance. The feelings of the Alolan people and our Pokémon, and the true nature of Z-Power... The answers lie in our dance! And so we must dance on!
