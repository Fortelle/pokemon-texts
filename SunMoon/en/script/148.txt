I am Kiawe.
My Marowak and I are students of the ancient dances that have been passed down in Alola for generations.
The trial of Kiawe... You will find that it is a bit different than the trials you have faced to this point, but of course, you will attempt it, right?
Of course!
Not right now
Well, <var>, it looks like you have failed my trial.
In my trial several Pokémon will appear, and you will indeed battle them. By carefully observing their dance, you can avoid unnecessary battles. Never forget that this is one way to approach the trial.
The Totem Pokémon Salazzle is a Poison and Fire type, so she is weak to Water-type moves. She also uses Torment to prevent your Pokémon from using the same move twice in a row. Good luck. I'm counting on you.
