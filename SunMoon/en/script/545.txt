Wow! Olivia's store is actually way more chic than I'd have expected. I know she's the island kahuna and all, but she seems like such a normal person, you know?

Hmm! I don't really understand these foreign goods, but they are pretty fun to look at. And I had no trouble understanding the stones and Fossils in Miss Olivia's store up there!
Kahuna Olivia is a Rock-type Pokémon user. It's pretty amazing, when you think about it. Rock types have plenty of weaknesses. She's definitely something, to be able to boast of such strength even when she uses such a disadvantageous type!
Opposite of the town you can find Memorial Hill and the Ruins of Life. You can feel the presence of the ancient kings of Alola there.



Alola, Heahea dweller!
Pika pika!
Pikapikapi!
Chaaa! ♪
Look at all these Pikachu! It's like a Pikachu splash! I'm so tickled pink that I think I'll give you this Pikanium Z!
Why don't you come talk to me if you teach your Pokémon the move Volt Tackle? Remember, a Pikachu with Z-Power is sure to be a happy Pikachu!
