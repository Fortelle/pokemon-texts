Ow! Arghhh! I've got dust in my eyes! Dust in my everywhere! Even my Pokémon are rubbing their eyes!
I've been getting so much dust in my eyes in this awful desert, you know? And my Pokémon have been rubbing their eyes a lot, too... How are your Pokémon doing? Are their eyes holding up in this mess?
They're burning brightly
They're sniffling all the time
They're looking pretty bleary
Well, that sounds like they might not be getting enough sleep. Warm them up and let them rest.
Wouldn't that be their noses, not their eyes? If they've got snot running down their faces, be a good Trainer and wipe it away for them!
Well, that doesn't sound good! I'll give you these, so put 'em on your Pokémon.
This Haina Desert, though... It's a beast. I've been wandering lost through it for... Well, I guess it's been about a year now. When am I ever going to get out of here?
Ow! Arghhh! More dust in my eyes! What I wouldn't give for a pair of Go-Goggles right about now...
