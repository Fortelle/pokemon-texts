Congratulations, <var>. I hope you find your Ride Pager useful. I worked on developing it with a friend of mine.
Aren't Z-Powers lovely?
I'm amazed that you won without even using your Z-Power.
Let's have a Pok√©mon battle when next we meet!
Very well then, off on your island challenge you go! May the future bring you happiness!
