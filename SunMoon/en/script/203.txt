Hey there!
You're still as fired up as ever, eh, "Royal"?
Ha! <var>, lemme introduce you. This is Molayne. He runs the observatory here, and also manages PC boxes, but he's not Hokulani's captain.
But I was the captain once, my masked friend.
It's <var>, right? Thanks for coming all the way up Hokulani to visit us. But our Captain Sophocles is a busy young man. Always calculating comets' paths or working on that Festival Plaza thing of his...
So I'll just determine whether you're qualified to take on the trial.
I'll heal your team first, of course.
I'll gladly show you the skills of a Trainer who toughened up while adventuring alongside Kukui back in the day!
Well, well, you certainly seem qualified to take on the trial.
Yeah, I think she's even stronger than we were at this point of our island challenge!
One more thing, cousinâ€”the name's Kukui! Who's this Masked Royal you're talking about?!
All right, cousin, I'm heading back to Malie Garden. I figure Hau should be done eating malasada by now, yeah? I'll make sure he makes it up here, too.
That guy's as interesting as ever. My old buddy!
Welcome to our observatory, <var>!
