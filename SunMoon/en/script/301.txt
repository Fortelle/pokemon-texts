Did you find her?
Yes! And Hapu was made the new kahuna!
Oh-ho! Now that's a joy to my ears. Her old grandfather must be smiling down on us.
Yes. Hapu will do her best for her late grandfather... as I must do my best for my mother's sake. And for Nebby, as well. A-and so! There's a place that we need to go.
Exeggutor Island
To find the flute
Exeggutor Island...? Oh, you mean where the flute is!
To find the flute? Oh, you must want Exeggutor Island!
Well, you two did meet the kahuna already... and Poni's captain ain't around anyway, so I guess there's no point waiting on any trials...
All right! The S.S. Magikarp will have you there, and you'll think you're sailing in a dream!
