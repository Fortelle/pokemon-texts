Phew... With Olivia in charge, we've finally managed to make some headway against those Diglett.
Oh! Alola! We're members of the Aether Foundation. We work to support Pokémon conservation.
It seems like Team Skull was responsible for the Diglett in this cave getting so riled up and bringing them all up to the surface.
Oh, Team Skull is this group of troublemakers, you see... They seem to delight in interfering with Trainers and their Pokémon.
Diglett normally live in elaborate systems of underground tunnels that take years to dig out. We're here to ensure that they return to their tunnels and let people pass through here without having to fight so many Pokémon.
Some of the Diglett are still stuck on or near the surface, though, so be careful!
