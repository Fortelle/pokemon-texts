Ah, <var>. It's been a while since we last saw you...
Wha—?!
Y...you came? You actually came to help me, <var>? Thank you... Thank you!
Hmm. So you know one another?
A gifted young Trainer like <var>... And she bothers with someone like you?
How disappointing.
I don't need your approval, Mother! Or your permission! I will save Cosmog!
My... You do say such incomprehensible things.
Calling me mother? I don't have any children! Certainly not any wretched children who would run off and reject my love!
So tell me how you'll save that Pokémon. What can you do, Lillie? You failed to convince me to listen to you. You don't even have the strength of a Trainer. The only thing that you've ever done on your own is steal someone else's research material!
You're not beautiful enough for my world... but fine. Since you're here anyway, you can watch me summon my sweet beast. And then...you can leave.
I'm not being foolish or selfish... I am asking you to listen, Mother! Do not sacrifice Cosmog for that beast's sake!
If you open the Ultra Wormhole, Cosmog will... Cosmog will die!
You're right... it probably will die. Because I'm going to force it to use its power whether it wants to or not!
Maybe if you really had been a daughter to me, I would have listened to you... Too bad.
<var>... I really am happy that you came after me... but...but...I have to be selfish again... I have to ask you one more time... Please...
Help me! Help Nebby! We have to save Nebby!
