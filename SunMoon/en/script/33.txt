You look ready for anything, now. Have a good time out there!
I'll be sure to have everything cleaned up and put away by the time you come back with your new Pokémon!
Woo, that's a stylin' hat, cousin!
Your mom there... She's sure looking forward to you getting your first Pokémon, yeah?
So let's get going to Iki Town! Time for you to get a real nice Pokémon from the island kahuna, oh yeah!
It'll be so nice to have another Pokémon around the house! Hurry back, <var>!
Mrowr.
