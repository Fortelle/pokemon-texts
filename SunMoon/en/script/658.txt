We've been collecting every last shard of Buginium Z in Alola for Mr. Guzma. All so that Mr. Guzma could be sure to be the strongest bug Pokémon user around!
I hear that Mr. Guzma never got a Z-Ring as a sort of handicap, 'cause he's too strong already.
The fireplace looks like it's been used as a home for a Fire-type Pokémon rather than firewood.
