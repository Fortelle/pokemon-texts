Hmph... Even beaten down, old Faba doesn't change, does he?
What do we do?
Beat whoever stands in our way. What other choice do we have?
Fine, fine. We can do that. But do you have to say "hmph" all the time?
Hello, children. I'm afraid Branch Chief Faba has given us orders regarding you three...
Now that you've learned of the darkness at the heart of Aether Paradise, we'll need you all to conveniently disappear!
Whoa! <var>! Battle with me!
Ridiculous... Have the children of Alola always been this strong?
That's what you get when you go through the trials of the island challenge. Now that you understand...how about you get out of our way?
Phew! Thanks, <var> and <var>! When you're fighting a battle you can't afford to lose, you really can't waver at all, huh...
Let's go.
You know... I know we aren't friends. But I'm glad you two are here... I remember what you said at Battle Royal Dome that day, Hau. About how people can achieve more if they do something together. Looks like maybe you were right.
