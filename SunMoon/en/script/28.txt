And we're here! This right here is Iki Town!
This town is where folks come to worship the Pok√©mon that watches over Melemele Island. Tapu Koko keeps us all safe and happy, see!
Huh? What's goin' on here? We were supposed to meet everybody right here, yeah.
Maybe they're all back there on Mahalo Trail. That's where the ruins of our guardian deity, Tapu Koko, are, yeah...
<var>! Do me a solid and go find the island kahuna! I'll wait around here to make sure we don't miss each other.
The island kahuna? You can't miss him. He looks just like a kahuna!
