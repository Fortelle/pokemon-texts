Thank you, Hapu! And thank you, Mudsdale!
That's what friends do.
F-friends...? An amazing Trainer like Hapu considers me... a friend?
Thank you, Hapu! I will not give up, no matter what!
To journey to Exeggutor Island, you should speak with the chief of the sea folk. I shall be wishing for your safety!
Mu-hiiiiiin!
