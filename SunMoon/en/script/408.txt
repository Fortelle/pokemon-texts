Would you just look at those biceps! They're bulging with strength! They're practically big enough to burst!
Can you even imagine how far you'd be able to drive a golf ball with muscles like those?!
Mah...
The Machamp seems uncomfortable... Should you stop them? You'll probably get dragged into a battle...
Stop them
Let them be
Uh, excuse you? What do you think you're doing? We hired this big fella to be our caddy. And we're in the middle of something important right now, so how about you get out of my grill?
Yeah, just get lost, would you?
Are you even serious about this? You've only got one Pokémon that can fight! There's no point in even battling someone like you!
What is up with you...
I know, right? Just totally killed the mood. Let's just go...
Geez, you little... What was that, huh? You trying to be a hero or something? What'd you go and do that for, huh? I'm not a Pokémon... I'm a born-and-bred human being, duh! This is just a costume!
Like, seriously, dudelady... Are you just here to ruin my day? Going and blowing all the hard work that I put into disguising myself as a Machamp caddy... I was going to make some real bank off this job! And then...you had to come along and try to "rescue" me... Man, I want to cry right now... But I know you were just trying to help. I can't get mad for what you did... So here... Just take this...
Now get lost... And don't you talk to me again...
Mah... (I told you not to talk to me...)
