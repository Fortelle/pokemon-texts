...Everything looks the same. I guess it's only been two years, though.
Wow! It's like a secret hideout!
Don't get too excited, Hau.
Though I guess it's better than freezing from fear or nerves.
So where do we go now?
There are two labs up ahead. I'll check the first lab, Secret Lab A. You two check out Secret Lab B. It's the second lab, down the hall.
Why do you get the first one? And why do you know all this?
...Just focus, Hau. Think you can do that? We can't trust Faba. I'm sure he's already told half the foundation all about us.
You didn't even answer my question... I know what it's gotta be. Nerves, eh? I reckon that you're more afraid to be here than either one of us, huh, Gladion?
Here, <var>. You take this.
Lillie must be scared right now... Let's buckle down and do this!
