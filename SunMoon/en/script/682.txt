No matter how strong I am, I know that there are things I can't do... Places I can't reach and people I can't protect. That's why I want to make all the kids at Aether House into superstrong Trainers themselves!
I wanna do the island challenge, too!
Hey, hey, d'you know how big the whole entire world is? Is it, like, infinity big?
