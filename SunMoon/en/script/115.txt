Why hello there. Nice to meet you all—I'm Olivia.
Hey! Thanks for stopping by! I'm Mallow, one of the captains here!
I was on my way to see who was pulling into port and ran into Mallow here while she was out on a delivery.
Yup! My trial will be a chance for all the fine ingredients that make up your team to shine!
Especially you two! Your Pokémon look ready to cook with gas!
And Mallow isn't the only captain here on Akala Island, of course.
So? What's the plan, kids?
Yeah, that's up to these kids. It's their island challenge, after all!
Yes...I suppose so.
OK, then. Enjoy your time on your island challenge, kids, along with your Pokémon. I'll be waiting for my chance to face you in battle when the time comes.
I'm looking forward to seeing what you've got!
Let's go, Mallow.
I'm sure she wanted to come see that you made it here all right... But she'll never admit it to you! Hah! That's Olivia for you. She's a kind kahuna, deep down.
There are three trials here on Akala Island. If you two decide you want to take on the trial straightaway, head up Route 4 there and keep on goin' until you get to Paniola Town.
Shoots, I know where I'm going first, and that is straight to the Pokémon Center!
I wonder what kind of malasada they make on Akala, eh?
Maybe I'll see about some shopping of my own... And I should find out about the ruins for Nebby's sake, too...
You've made it to Akala, big boyclever girl! This means a whole new Island Pokédex, zzt! I'll try to keep you up to date on all the new Pokémon you uncover, <var>! Zzzzzt!
