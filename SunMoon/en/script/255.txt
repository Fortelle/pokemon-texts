You people...
Not gonna disappear this time, huh? Seems like maybe the tall tales we heard about you were wrong.
That was different... Nebby and I were both in trouble... That was the only reason why it used its power. So we both could escape with our lives...
I know that I'm not capable of much myself, but I will not make it use that power again! I'm determined to not let that happen. That's why... this time I'll do whatever I can on my own even if I do find myself in trouble again.
Yo, girl, you know you're in trouble right now, right? Dumb spoiled little princess!
It's fine. There's nothing more for us to take from you.
Which reminds me...
Maybe we're not the only ones around here who could be called Pok√©mon thieves. Is that what you are, huh? A thief?
Please... there is no need to hurt anyone else here. I will go with you willingly. Wherever you want.
