You defeated Olivia, didn't you? To commemorate your victory, I'll give you a special item!
The item I just gave you is a Reveal Glass. It's a looking glass that changes the shape of Tornadus, Thundurus, and Landorus.
Mirrors can be scary, can't they? Sometimes after I work through the night, I look into the mirror and I seem to see a stranger staring back at me...
