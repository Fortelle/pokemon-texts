The time has finally come, <var>!
So, I guess I should explain what kind of trial this is, huh?
This old building is full of lots of Ghost-type Pokémon. Did you know? Here's where the trial part comes in. You've got to find the Totem Pokémon of this site and snap a shot of it with a Poké Finder!
The totem is a bit of a trickster, and it likes to play hide-and-seek and mess around. If you take pictures of the other Ghost-type Pokémon inside, it'll definitely come out to get in on the fun and have its photo taken, too!
So, if you see something weird happening inside this old place, try to check it out. I bet you'll find a Ghost-type Pokémon causing the mischief, so get its photo before it's gone!
I'll just borrow your Poké Finder for a sec. Hee hee! And your Rotom is a Ghost type, too!
We just do this, and...
There! I've set it up to use a special shooting mode just for this trial. You'll only be able to use it at this site, though.
As soon as you enter the building, your trial will begin. Got it? And you can't catch any of the Pokémon, either. And you can't leave without giving up, too, so make sure you're ready for anything!
