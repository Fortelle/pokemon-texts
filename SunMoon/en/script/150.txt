Onward to the second dance!
Watch carefully and memorize this dance.
What was different from the previous dance?
The right Marowak
The middle Marowak
The left Marowak
The Hiker
Show me again!
B-but how?! That was truly spectacular! And to add to the spectacle... Come, my fine Hiker!
Alola!
My Hiker friend was so pleased by your right answer that he simply had to battle you!
Astounding! It is astounding how wrong you are! Come, Marowak!
Wa-wak!
When you answer incorrectly, my Marowak grow so enraged that they cannot help but attack. Watch once more, carefully this time!
