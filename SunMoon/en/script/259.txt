You there, boy.
You there, girl.
I'm an island kahuna, you know. Battle against me. It'll be a good experience for you if you're really hoping to master the island challenge.
OK, I will
No thanks
The trip here already wore me out. If you don't want to battle, I'm going home.
Don't take it too serious, now.
Well, shoot... Of course I already knew you had the heart and the strength to storm Team Skull's stronghold, but I didn't know you were this good. And your Pok√©mon worked real hard for you. Let me fix your team up for you.
Here. This is yours.
If you want to use the Dark-type Z-Power, you've gotta do it like this.
There. Congratulations or whatever. You've officially finished your Ula'ula trials.
You've got somewhere else to be, don't you? Try not to destroy the whole place. Oh... And you, boy. Gladion. Tell me... If you're really trying to get stronger as you say, then what're you depending on Team Skull for?
