Hey there, Trainer! You can call me Future. People call me the sound-making machine that can make the hits of the not-so-distant future. And this here beside me is my partner, Hit.
Ruff ruff!
Puppy Pok√©mon can be pretty scatterbrained, always barking up the wrong tree at things, but you can't beat their beautiful cries!
Rauuuuuu!
See? Thanks to this clever girl, and her lovely voice, writing new songs is as easy as pie! I know I probably don't even need to ask, but... You have heard of me before, right?
Never have
Not till today
Whoa! That is bad news for you, friend! You are clearly behind on the times!
I guess I'll make sure people know who I am! If not through songs, then through battle!
All right
I'm fine not knowing you
Well, whenever you want to get a taste for the future, you are always welcome to come back!
That's the tune I've been waiting to hear! I hope you're ready to face Future!
Would you look at that, Hit? This Trainer is amazing! I think I've thought of my next future hit melody thanks to that battle!
Raaauuu!
Look at that! Even Hit is getting excited! She's normally so laid-back about everything! Let me give you a little present to thank you for this dose of inspiration!
That Metronome right there is a key tool if you hope to capture the song of the future! I don't know how to use it for battling though! You'll have to tune in to that for yourself!
My music is going to shape the future! That's my dream!
Ruff!
