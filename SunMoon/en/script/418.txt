So...so...
Cooor!
This Pokémon seems to be hurt... What will you do?
Use a Potion on it
Take it to a Pokémon Center
Sorry, sorry, sorry! I know! I took way too long! ...Huh?
I just left my Pokémon here to play for a little bit while I was shopping in town. I checked that there weren't any Pokémon here that would bully my Corsola but... But there was a Mareanie hiding in the rocks! Oooh! I want to fish it up and show it my wrath!
Mareanie love breaking off and eating Corsola's branches more than anything else in the world! They hunt Corsola down mercilessly to gnaw and nibble on their branches! Sure, the Corsola's branches can regenerate and they'll eventually grow back, but... That doesn't make it any less scary for Corsola!
You were worried about my Corsola and trying to help them, weren't you? Thank you. You're a really nice Trainer. Here, take this from me. It might come in handy.
Come on, let's get you both all better. Off to the Pokémon Center!
