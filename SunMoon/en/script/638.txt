I heard this garden was designed by people who came here to Alola from Johto.
So that's it! I thought it felt kind of exotic!
C'mon, Slowpoke... Let's just take it easy, OK? Well...I guess you're always taking it easy, huh? You're such a slowpoke, Slowpoke!
Slooow!
It's a map of Malie Garden. Apparently there is some kind of motif?
The water sure is clear here, huh? I wonder if the Pokémon are all hiding in the shadows of the rocks or something?
No riding upon any Pokémon within the garden, except for Charizard.
