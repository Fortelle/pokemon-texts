Nice to meet you, <var>!
Pew!
Oh! When did you get out again? I know that Kahuna Hala and the professor will keep you safe from any harm, but you should still stay in the bag and out of sight. It's safer that way.
I think you chose a wonderful Pokémon. Please take very good care of it.
That's it, <var>! Now that you've got a Pokémon, you're a real Pokémon Trainer, yeah! And here's a lovely gift from me to help make it special, cousin.
You obtained a Pokédex!
A Pokédex is a real high-tech kinda tool, yeah, that can automatically record facts about any Pokémon that you meet. Your new partner <var> is already registered, oh yeah, so check it out!
And this is a Trainer Passport that I had put together for you.
Now why don't you go introduce your new friend to your mom, <var>?
If you two can work in harmony with each other, you can go anywhere together!
Hang on a second... I feel like I'm forgetting somebody, yeah...
If you'd really like to get to know your new friend <var>, you could check out all of its information in your Pokédex.
