Oh my... Looks like our Berry stock is getting a bit low. I'd better put in another order for delivery from the Berry fields...
She's taking longer than usual today... I wonder if she got distracted along the way?
Brr!
That Delibird belongs to the farmer who runs the Berry fields. She helps deliver the Berries that they grow and harvest in the fields.
Brr brrrd!
Thank you for your hard work! You've brought the Berries safe and sound.
Brrr!
...Wait a moment. This isn't a Berry, though. I suppose you must have picked it up along the way, but it's not part of our order. Why don't you take it back home with you?
Brr?
Brr!
Delibird is offering you something!
Take it
Don't take it
Brr brrd!
Why don't you take it?
Brr!
What a silly bird! If there are extra Berries, she has them down her gullet in seconds. But even she knows better than to swallow a Shell Bell, it seems!
We should be all set for a good while now. We won't need any deliveries for some time.
