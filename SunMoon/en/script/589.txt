Hrmm... There are no traditional-looking clothes here that go well with my Oranguru, are there? Maybe I should just choose some items that will be useful in battle instead...
Gu do it!
You know what? If you like an outfit that someone is wearing in Festival Plaza, they can have apparel items delivered straight to you!
