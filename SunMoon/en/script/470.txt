The name's Mr. Hyper! You want to know why I'm so hyper? Because I can help Pokémon do Hyper Training! Allow me to explain! Hyper Training is a way to help Pokémon that have reached Lv. 100 become even stronger! This special training can help them increase their strength and HP and other stats! If you want me to train up your Pokémon, bring me some Bottle Caps. I collect them. A regular Bottle Cap will get you training for a single stat. But bring me a rare Gold Bottle Cap, and I'll train up all your Pokémon's stats to the max at once!
What do you say? Want to try some of my Hyper Training to boost your Pokémon's stats?
Oh no... No, no, no! You don't have a Bottle Cap or a Gold Bottle Cap! Not even one!
Then come back anytime! Mr. Hyper will always be hyped up to see you!
Which one of your Pokémon do you want to do some Hyper Training on?
But that Pokémon is already so awesome that it doesn't need any training!
So will it be a Bottle Cap or a Gold Bottle Cap? See how many you've got and let me know.
Which one of <var>'s stats do you want to do some Hyper Training on?
Then get hype! Because I'm about to do some real Hyper Training on <var> here!
All right! <var> got even stronger thanks to my Hyper Training!
Do you want to put any of your other Pokémon through their paces, eh?
Oh no... No, no, no! That Pokémon hasn't leveled up enough to be ready for my amazing Hyper Training! Only Lv. 100 Pokémon can handle the hype!
So you want me to get all of <var>'s different stats hyped up?
<var> Caps
<var> Gold Caps
Never mind
An Egg?! I understand why you're hyped to have one, but I can't train that thing yet!
