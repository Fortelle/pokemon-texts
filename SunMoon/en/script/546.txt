You might not ever be royalty, but you might at least feel you are if you take on the Battle Royal at the Battle Royal Dome!
You can really get a sense for a person's nature from the way they throw their Poké Balls.

Captain Mallow is an amazing cook, too. Especially that Mallow Special... It's like a taste explosion in my mouth!

When you get your hands on a fishing rod for the first time, you just can't wait to go to the shore and search for Pokémon, can you? It's amazing how one little item can totally change your life.

Look at that Z-Ring glittering on your left wrist! Now that is an item to envy, for sure. I can't help but admire anyone wearing one!
I've done...zero squats!
Kraaa!
