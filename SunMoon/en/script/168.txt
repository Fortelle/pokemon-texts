Team Skull! Give back that Pokémon!
Don't give me trouble! I'll reduce you to rubble!
That's right! We're gonna sell this Pokémon to get rich, and we won't make no bones about it! If you want it back, you're gonna have to take it!
Stand firm! Think of what the president would say!
That's what you say, Chief! But you don't lift a finger!
Why, I am the Aether Foundation's last line of defense! What would become of the foundation if something were to happen to me now?
Ah! Here is a promising young Trainer! Fight in my stead, child, and rout these Team Skull ruffians. I will bestow honor upon you, if you do!
You ready? Cuz I was born ready, yo!
That loss was pathetic! Your moves were so kinetic!
We don't need this Pokémon anyway! Take it then! Good luck and good riddance!
Phew...
Lo-o-ow?
Thanks, kid!
Yes, indeed. You are a trial-goer, aren't you? You're a splendid Trainer.
I am deeply impressed! I'd like to reward you by showing you something truly astounding. Once you have finished your grand trial, come to Hano Grand Resort and I will take you to see a wondrous place.
Thank you for helping us out. I really owe you!
I'm so glad there are nice young Trainers like you around. Good luck on your island challenge!
