Hey there, <var>! Go see what you can learn from everybody!
How about that, <var>? If Ultra Beasts are really out there, I wonder what kinds of moves they can use...
You've finished all three of Akala's trials. Woo! And now comes the big match against Olivia— the island kahuna! It's the biggest and baddest trial of them all here on Akala—the grand trial!
Good luck! Olivia's house is past Diglett's Tunnel. It's in Konikoni City! But watch out for Team Skull!
I still have some things I want to talk to Professor Burnet about, so I'll stay here.
I'm off to check out Diglett's Tunnel next! It's a whole cave made by Pokémon, right?
