OH EM GEE! Please don't tell me that's my Skull Tank you're wearing?
Ohhh, no wonder it stinks! It is the same design, though.
It does not stink! That's a lovely aroma! Anyway, we should write our names on them so we don't mix them up.
Uhmm, hello! Our names are all Grunt. What's the point?
Ooh, a boy! I can't believe he was eavesdropping on us! I guess we'll have to teach him a lesson!
Oh no! There's some cute girl who heard everything we were saying! I'm so embarrassed! I'll take it out on her!
How embarrassing... I guess I really am just a Grunt.
Whoa, that was, like, so uncool! I'll get revenge for you...while still wearing your Skull Tank!
Ugh! Her Skull Tank was too tight for me! It was so distracting that I lost! It's all her fault!
I've made up my mind! I'm gonna get rich and famous and buy as many Skull Tanks as I want!
