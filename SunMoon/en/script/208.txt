CORRECT! OPENING DOOR...
Gru-grub!
Whoa! As soon as the door opened, a Pokémon came through! I'm counting on you, <var>!
I knew you could do it, <var>! Oh, and just when I said it, the door closed again!
I-it's gonna be OK. The Totem Pokémon is on its way.
DETECTED PRESENCE OF APPROACHING TOTEM POKÉMON!
Yeaaarrrrrgh! When you get an answer wrong, the security system kicks in and sends out a shock! Eww, do you smell something burning?! It's all right! I'm OK. I'm a tough kid! I'm a tough kid!
Soffy! I'll shut the system down as soon as I can, so hang in there!

CORRECT! OPENING DOOR...
Charj!
Whoa! As soon as the door opened, a Pokémon came through! This one's up to you, too, <var>!
I knew you could do it, <var>! Oh, and would you look at that—the door closed again while I was flapping my jaw!
I-it's gonna be OK. The Totem Pokémon is on its way.
TOTEM POKÉMON STILL APPROACHING!
Yeaaarrrrrgh! When you get an answer wrong, the security system kicks in and sends out a shock! My whole body is buzzzzing!
Soffy! I can hear a buzz in your voice! I think I can just about shut the system down...

CORRECT! OPENING DOOR...
I-it looks like the door's about to open...
Charj!
I-I knew it! I'm counting on you again, <var>!
I knew you could do it, <var>! And then of course the door goes and shuts again! Fool me once, shame on the door. Fool me twice, shame on the security system. Fool me thrice, shame on me, I guess...
Here it comes! We're picking up traces of the Totem Pokémon extremely close by!
TOTEM POKÉMON INCOMING!
Yeaaarrrrrgh! When you get an answer wrong, the security system kicks in and sends out a shock! Big Mo, if you don't hurry up, I'm gonna be an Electric type by the time I get out of here!
Wait, why would you do that?! That was on purpose, wasn't it?! Yeaaarrrrrgh! When you get an answer wrong, the security system kicks in and sends out a shock! Big Mo, if you don't hurry up, I'm gonna be an Electric type by the time I get out of here!
Stay calm, Soffy! Electric types can't be paralyzed, after all!
Vwoon!
Gyargh?! No way! Did I blow a fuse?!
Oww! Did the door close?! Let's see, we'll need to turn off the security system to get the door open...
You'll have to pass an audio quiz!
I-it's fine. I definitely feel a powerful presence. It's coming now. The Totem Pokémon is coming.
So let's get this trial going, OK? My trial is about to begin!
