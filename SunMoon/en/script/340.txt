Four Trainers!
Every Pokémon League in every region all over the world features four fantastic Trainers called the Elite Four.
Here in Alola, too, we've got four Trainers all lined up for our Pokémon League.
You'll win your way past every last one of them. You can't leave until you do... or until you give up.
Sounds good!
Sounds...tough
<var> can sense when its Trainer is nervous. Stay loose! You'll be fine!
What're you talking about? You're a great Trainer in your own right, plus you've got <var> on your side!
I expect you to show me some intense moves and real heart-stopping battles in there! Good luck, <var>! <var>!
Woo! You really showed those Elite Four what you were made of all right! Now check out that glowing area over there, and find yourself the Champion's chamber!
