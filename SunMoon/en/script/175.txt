So you've come at last.
Ah. But forgive me. I have yet to introduce myself. You may call me Faba. I told you before that I would show you someplace astounding, right? Well, that wondrous place is...Aether Paradise!
Let me tell you about Aether Paradise. Just as the name suggests, Aether Paradise is a veritable paradise for Pokémon that floats far out in the sea surrounding Alola. It is an artificial island, made entirely by human technology, for the protecting of Pokémon! Of course I'm an adult who keeps his promises. So I will prove to you that all I've told you is the absolute truth with a tour of Aether Paradise. You will come, won't you?!
Good, good. Then you'll come with me. Aether Paradise will amaze you.
Hmm. Yes. Well, children are often too frivolous and aimless to properly think through— Ahem. I mean they value their freedom so. But the answer that I want to hear from you is a resounding "Yes!" Now let's hear it!
Wait! Take me, too!
Oh? Even Kahuna Olivia has come to see you off?
As a kahuna, I look after all the trial-goers who come to my island. They're like my own children. Not that I've got any—I've never even gotten married.
Listen up, you two. Your greatest opponent is always yourself. Your greatest allies, the Pokémon beside you.
Thanks! Are you coming, too, Professor?
I've got my own business to attend to. You go see all the amazing tech that Aether's developing and tell me about it later, yeah?
That's right. I'll see you on the next island... Ula'ula Island, yeah? Then let's meet up at Malie Garden!
Yup! It's good-bye, Akala Island! Though I guess we can come back anytime we want to, huh?
Then let us enjoy an adventure upon that grand vessel that will take us across the high seas! By which I mean to say, the ferry.
