You see!
All over Alola!
P...ew...
Ugh... Must you be so noisy, even inside there? What an annoying Pok√©mon. The only thing I need from you is your power!
But I will admit... it looks like that power has served me well.
There should be plenty of beautiful beasts appearing all around Alola as we speak!
Look! On Akala and Poni... Even on Melemele Island!
Ho ho ho ho!
Near Melemele Island's Mahalo Trail...
