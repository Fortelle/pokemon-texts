When Pokémon evolve, their appearance can change quite a lot. Some Pokémon can also change forms, which can change how they look and their stats. And then there are the regional variants, which are quite another thing altogether. Pokémon don't just change into regional variants like they might change forms.
Yaaarghhh?! What is going on?!
We do all kinds of research and development in Aether Paradise's basement labs so that we can better help with Pokémon conservation.
Th-th-that hole... Is that the Ultra Wormhole that Professor Mohn discovered?!
Caring for Pokémon that were abandoned by their Trainers is another way that we care for Pokémon here.
Is that thing a Pokémon?!
The president's father was a very wealthy man from abroad, and he dedicated his fortune to helping Pokémon. Now our president works to further that noble goal here at the Aether Foundation.
I-I can't fight something like that... Please...you have to protect the president! Protect Aether Paradise!
Regional variants... It can all seem a bit complicated, but think about it like this... If you visit a tropical region, you get a tan, right? Isn't it something like that?
It's like it tore a hole in space... Does this world connect to...somewhere else?
Starmie is known as the Mysterious Pokémon. If it's really a star from the night sky appearing to us in a different form... Then it's like a Pokémon is just using us humans and making us take care of it. Do you ever imagine things like that? I do.
Wh-what is that hole?! What is going on?!
Sudowoodo is a Pokémon that pretends to be a tree in order to protect itself. But...wouldn't it be better to disguise itself as the kind of tree you actually see here in Alola?
Wood?
The PC Boxes were first developed by a guy in the Kanto region called Bill. Apparently he's a real Pokémon maniac!
Imagine using the same Pokémon in your Boxes in battle again after hundreds of years... It's like a kind of time machine, isn't it?
