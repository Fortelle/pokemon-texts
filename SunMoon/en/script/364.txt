Uh... Now who was I again? ... ... ... ... ... ... Oh yes! I'm the Move Deleter! I can make Pokémon forget their moves.
You're here so I can make your Pokémon forget a move, um-hmm?
Which Pokémon would that be?
Just remember me when there's something you want to forget!
What's that, friend? That Pokémon only knows one move, you know?
What's this, friend? Eggs don't know any moves before they hatch.
Mm-hmm... And which move should it forget?
It was a great success! Your Pokémon has forgotten that it ever even knew <var>!
Everyone calls me Madam Memorial. I know every move that a Pokémon learns as it grows, you see. I can also help your Pokémon remember any of those moves that it has let go in the past. I'll help your Pokémon recover their lost moves in exchange for Heart Scales, if you have any.
Would you like to remind your Pokémon of a long-forgotten move?
If there's a move you'd like one of your Pokémon to remember, bring me a <var>!
Which Pokémon is it?
That is an Egg.
This Pokémon doesn't yet have any moves to be recovered.
Which move would you like it to remember?
You gave a <var> in thanks.
Now it has remembered that move! Come again if you need anything else!
Do you want me to teach Volt Tackle to your Pikachu?
If you come to me with Pikachu, I'll teach it Volt Tackle.
Pikanium Z will turn Pikachu's Volt Tackle into its Z-Move!
Which Pikachu do you want me to teach the move to?
That Pokémon can't learn Volt Tackle. Only Pikachu can learn the move.
An Egg that can use Volt Tackle... I would love to see it, but I can't teach the move to an Egg.
All righty then. Whoa. That Pikachu has already learned Volt Tackle!
Do you want me to teach Volt Tackle to that <var> of yours?
Pikachu will be happy with its Z-Power!
Please choose a move that will be replaced with <var>.
<var> learned <var>!
1, 2, and... ... ... Ta-da! <var> forgot how to use <var>. And... <var> learned <var>!
<var> did not learn <var>.
