Hey there, <var>! Oooh, looking at the expression on Ilima's face, I'd say you cleared your first trial, yeah?
Guess I better give you a little reward... Time to learn about Z-Power. Woo!
Watch and learn, cousin!




Phew! Z-Powers heap all of a Trainer's feelings onto a Pok√©mon, yeah, which totally wears you out! Using Z-Power once per battle is all a team can handle, yeah.
Oh, so is that why you've been looking so ragged, Professor?
No! It's like I was hit with Amnesia! I forgot that I lost Lillie somewhere on Route 3! Think you could spare some time to help me look for her, <var>?
I can go and have a look around the cave for you, in case she wandered that way.
Thanks, cousin. Let's split up and find her, yeah!
