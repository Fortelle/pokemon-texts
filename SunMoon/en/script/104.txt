Nebby! Nebby, come back!
Ah... <var>...
Nebby ran off into the meadow here...
And right after it got into so much trouble on the bridge, too... What if a wild Pokémon attacks it? It doesn't have any moves it can use to battle!
Here, <var>. Let me heal your Pokémon for you...
I always carry lots of Potions on me to keep Nebby healthy. That's the best I can do, since I'm not a real Trainer or anything...
Pew!
Oh, you!
Pew?
Thank you, <var>.
And I should thank <var>, too. Here, let me at least do this...
You know, I read something interesting in a book once... It seems the Pokémon called Oricorio changes appearance by feeding on the nectar from different types of flowers. It's not actually evolving but undergoing a so-called "form change." Isn't that interesting? I thought it was, anyway...
Pew!
Back into the bag, please, Nebby. I know there aren't many people around to see you here, but that's hardly an excuse! And I guess we should be going now... The professor will probably be worried after the way we just disappeared on him...
