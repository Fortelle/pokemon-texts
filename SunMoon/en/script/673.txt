It's fine not to have any great ideology yet. Just don't make any rash decisions.
It's only by reading some really terrible books that you learn to recognize the good ones!
The Legendary Pokémon and the Tapu A great and terrible battle waged between the tapu and the Legendary Pokémon, but neither side could claim victory over the other. Upon finding themselves equals, the Legendary Pokémon then gifted the tapu with great power of unknown providence.
The Guardian Deities of the Islands The tapu regularly keep themselves closed tight in their shells as they absorb nature's energy. After many long years of absorbing such energy, their shells become hard and sturdy.
The Tapu and the Island Kahunas The tapu choose the kahunas of their islands and entrust them with special sparkling stones. What reasoning they use to make such a choice, however, is not at all apparent to observers.
The Guardians and the Ancient Kings In ancient times, the tapu served as the leaders of the armies of each island's king, but if they used their Z-Power in battle, it caused great destruction across the islands. Because of this, the tapu came to no longer lend their aid in the wars of men.
