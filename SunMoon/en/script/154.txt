You there!
Oh, excuse me! I am a scientist. My name is Colress. The theme of my research is: "Bringing out the potential of Pokémon." What brings out the power of Pokémon is...
I believe that is—the bond they share with their Trainers!
And thus my attention is drawn to Trainers like yourself... Trainers bound to their Pokémon through the power of the Z-Ring!
Now that I think of it, I never asked your name. ...



Z-Power... Is it the true potential that I seek? Does it surpass the Mega Ring? Apparently, there are uninhabited islands for Pokémon called Poké Pelago here in Alola. Alola is fascinating! I believe that I will stay in Alola for some time!
Well then, <var>, I hope to see you again sometime.
<var>, is it? I'll remember your name. To commemorate our encounter, let me give you a TM.
If you're able to utilize Flame Charge fully, you'll be able to have a great battle with the totem in the next trial...the trial in Lush Jungle.
