Well...I'm afraid that the little kerfuffle we went through resulted in my demotion. I am turning over a new leaf and beginning over as one of the rank and file. When all is said and done, I feel like I've become a completely different person. In mind and body.
Could the new and improved Faba request a battle with you?
Of course
I'd rather not
Then here I come! The new and improved Faba makes his debut!
No! Does my new and improved form so intimidate you?
So what did you think of the new and improved Faba, hmm? With my newfound charm, you will see me make my comeback within the foundation! And for that I will have to gain quite a bit of support behind me.
That is just a little token from me, so you won't forget the new Faba. Now watch as I work my way up the ladder of the foundation once more!
When I was reduced to this low-ranking position, I had a sudden revelation. I desperately long for that title of respect!
