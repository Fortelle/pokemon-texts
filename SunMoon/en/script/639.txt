Got it! Then just come give me a holler when you want to go, OK?
Maggggmar!
Alola is a tropical region, but mountain peaks can be cold. I'm so smart that I brought Magmar with me!

The peak of Mount Hokulani is the second closest place to space in the Alola region!
Thanks to Pokémon's help, I can patrol even the peak of a mountain!
Pokémon are in space, too? Wow!
Whoa! Are you walking down the mountain? It's pretty far to the next bus stop!
Oh, hello! Hello! Alola!
You know, there's this Pokémon called Minior. It comes down from space like a shooting star. And the cores of these Minior seem to shine in a number of different colors! They don't seem to be regional variants, but it's an interesting phenomena nonetheless.
Here! I've been wanting to give you this.
I hope you'll try to complete your Pokédex. For Rotom's sake as well!
