I saw those Team Skull numskulls loitering around the Marina again. I reported it to the captain, of course.
This is what happens when young people have nothing to do and too much time on their hands!
What a bunch of useless thugs! All they do is drag Trainers into battles they don't want and try to steal people's Pokémon!
I heard they keep trying to sneak into the trial site to steal Pokémon to sell... and that they fail every single time!
