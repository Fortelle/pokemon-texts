The kahuna is back! Kahuna Hala has returned!
Our guardian's chosen one is back!
Only one of the strongest Pokémon users in all Alola, yeah!
Have I missed something?
Naw, but where'd you go off to, Kahuna? I thought we were meeting here.
I am kahuna of this island, after all. Whenever there is a problem on the island, it is my duty to resolve it.
Sorry, Lillie. What were you saying before? For some reason I thought I saw Tapu Koko flying about...
Oh, um... Yes, Kahuna Hala... Nebby was being attacked by Spearow on the Plank Bridge when this boygirl helped it get away...
But the bridge collapsed, and I thought both of them might fall to the bottom of the ravine... And that was when the island's guardian deity swooped in to save them!
Woo! That's something you don't hear every day!
Ho! Although it is said to protect us, our Tapu Koko is a rather fickle creature. Yet our guardian was moved to save you.
Kukui, my boy, I think we have cause to celebrate! It seems I should entrust this brave and kind young boy with a Pokémon of his own. We'll make a fine Trainer out of him!

I'm glad to meet you, child. I am Hala, the kahuna of Melemele Island. Welcome to Alola! Young Kukui had told me of your coming. I'm glad we got the chance to meet today.
Come, my Pokémon! Let's have a look at you!
First is the Grass-type Pokémon, Rowlet!
Koo!
Next is the Fire-type Pokémon, Litten!
Mrowr...
And last is the Water-type Pokémon, Popplio!
Bwark?
