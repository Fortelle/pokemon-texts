Welcome to the Rock Chamber!
No introduction needed here. Time to battle me, Olivia!
I don't see the same look in your eyes that I saw when we first met on Akala Island. Have you had some experiences that you'll carry with you in your heart forever? Well, it's time for you to move on.
I won't be holding back! My Rock-type Pokémon will grind you to dust! Your puny little Pokémon are going to go down in one hit! Hah!
What a spectacular Trainer you are! Now when the children of Alola finish their island challenge, they can visit the Pokémon League to try to become the Champion! The Trainers of Alola will become even stronger!
You should get moving. You still have three more rooms left, right?
Don't stop now. You still have two more rooms left, right?
I'll stay here and wonder why you left me waiting so long for your challenge...
Let me guess...you're the type who likes to save the most delicious bite for the end of the meal?
