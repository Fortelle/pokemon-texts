You summon the Totem Pokémon and prove your strength to it... That's what every trial boils down to, right?
So I thought... Why not just call the totem here from the start?
So I tried a bit of this and that, and I think I've whipped up a little device to call the Totem Pokémon.
Perhaps you're wondering why I built a machine? Here at the observatory, we also monitor sounds that we detect from outer space. There are some sounds that are inaudible to people but Pokémon can hear just fine.
We broadcast the sounds we have gathered terrestrially and monitor the reactions of Pokémon. The machine that summons the Totem Pokémon makes use of this technology...
Utilizing other sounds we have gathered, we also developed a security system here... But that was actually Big Mo's invention.
Just so you know... This will actually be my first time trying it out, so I'm glad you came. I needed a test subject.
Ping Totem Pokémon 2.0, engage!
Now the totem should—
Vwoon!
Gyargh?! No way! Did I blow a fuse?!
Oww! Did the door close?! Let's see, we'll need to turn off the security system to get the door open...
You'll have to pass an audio quiz! 
I-it's fine. I definitely feel a powerful presence. It's coming now. The Totem Pokémon is coming.
So let's get this trial going, OK? My trial is about to begin!
