How are you, <var>?
Zygarde at 100%... You might be able to control it fully!
If you collect all Cells and Cores, please visit the Aether Base on Route 16 on Ula'ula Island. Use the Reassembly Unit there, and you can transform them into a Zygarde!
While we were having you look into Zygarde for us...
we were looking into the Z-Ring, too.
It's so mysterious... to be talking about Mega Evolution here, in a region so far away from Kalos...
But we are Trainers. Rather than explaining it all in words, why don't we just show you what Mega Evolution is!
The Trainer holds the Key Stone! The Pokémon holds the Mega Stone! And that's how you can make your Pokémon Mega Evolve during battle!
You can use the Z-Ring! So you must be able to use a Key Stone that makes Mega Stones resonate!
If you have a Key Stone, you'll be able to make your Pokémon that hold a Mega Stone Mega Evolve!
This is a Mega Stone that makes Alakazam Mega Evolve. It's called an Alakazite! I'll give the Key Stone and an Alakazite to you!
You know, when you think about it... The Z-Ring helps the feelings of a Trainer reach his or her Pokémon and makes it so it can use its Z-Power, right? It only follows that it should be able to achieve Mega Evolution, too!
We'll be taking our leave now! Bon voyage!
