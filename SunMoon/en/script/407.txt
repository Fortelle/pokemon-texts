I heard that other regions have these "Pokémon Day Care" places... Apparently you can leave Pokémon there, and they'll raise your Pokémon for you.
We've got nurseries here in Alola, but all we do is hold on to your Pokémon for you. We don't help them get stronger or learn any moves, but I'd guess we're easier on your wallet!
Oh, and there is something else! If you leave two Pokémon together at the nursery, you sometimes end up finding an Egg! Since we're talking about it, do you want one of the Eggs I found here at the nursery recently?
Thanks for taking it off my hands! And don't go trying to crack it just because you can't wait to see what's inside! Though I've never heard of a Pokémon Egg cracking except when it's ready to hatch.
Oh, yeah? Well, I'll hold on to it for now, but if you change your mind, this Egg can be yours!
Do you want one of the Eggs I found here at the nursery recently?
If you carry a Pokémon Egg around with you, it will hatch into a Pokémon. I bet it must feel pretty happy being surrounded by your team, even before it's born.
Whoa! You can't even take an Egg?! How many Pokémon have you caught?! I guess I'll hold on to it for now, but it's yours if you ever want it.
