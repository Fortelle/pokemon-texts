Phew... Look, <var>! Seems like we're almost to the Aether House, where the captain is supposed to be, huh?
Hey, look! Construction workers! That must be what Kukui was talking about! So they're really making a Pokémon League up on top of Mount Lanakila...
The professor told me that Pokémon Leagues in other regions have four crazy-strong Trainers in them that they call the Elite Four!
The Elite Four and our island kahunas... I wonder which ones are stronger! I can't wait to find out!
