Oh! <var>...
Pew?
You looking for the ruins?
You looking for new clothes?
Yes, this little fellow will hardly sit still... I think Nebby might be interested in visiting the Ruins of Life. Apparently they house the sacred guardian of Akala Island. A creature called Tapu Lele.
Well, yes, I was doing that, too. But this little fellow will hardly sit still... I think Nebby might be interested in visiting the Ruins of Life. Apparently they house the sacred guardian of Akala Island. A creature called Tapu Lele.
Pew?
I wondered if you'd like to come with us when we go to visit the ruins... I mean...little Nebby here seems to like you quite a bit, <var>...
I'll be at Tide Song Hotel if you decide you want to come. I'm supposed to be meeting someone there... Someone very important to me...
I'll be all right. I can see the building from here, after all. Even I shouldn't be able to lose my way. I think.
Pew!
And you! I'll have you stay in your bag, mister.
I've heard that there is a group of terrible people around who try to steal Pok√©mon. A group called Team Skull. We need to be careful if we want to escape the notice of such a collection of villains... Isn't that right, <var>?
I wonder if the guardian of Akala will also be interested in you, <var>... You are the one who got that sparkling stone.
