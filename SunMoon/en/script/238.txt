Hey, <var>! You gave up last time in the middle of my trial, huh? 
The Ghost types in that old place are pretty tough to take on, huh? Remember that Ghost types are weak to other Ghost types and Dark types, too! I'm sure you'll make it this time! Don't give up on my trial yet! I believe in you!
Mimikyu is a pretty tough opponent, isn't it? It's a Ghost- and Fairy-type Pok√©mon. Did you know? Neither type has a lot of weaknesses, so it's tricky to beat. You probably want to try Ghost- or Steel-type moves against it. I'm sure you'll beat it this time! Don't give up on my trial yet! I believe in you!
