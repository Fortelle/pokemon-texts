Young master.
What d'you mean "young master"?!
It has been a long time...
And hello to you two, <var> and Hau. Please allow me to heal your Pokémon.
What's happened to Lillie? Do you know anything?
I...imagine that she is with the president.
Then that's where I'm going. That's all I need to know.
The president? That's Miss Lusamine, right? She's a really nice person, so I'm sure she'll listen to us if we explain everything.
Yeah, she's real nice...as long as you mean nothing to her.
But I'm afraid the doors have been locked...
Again?!
That's not stopping me.
Please look after young Master Gladion. When he is worked up about something, he doesn't consider the consequences. Even going so far as stealing Pokémon... Those two truly are very much alike...
