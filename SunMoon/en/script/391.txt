Welcome to the Trainers' School! I'm the principal.
What an honor for me and the school! To think that our teachings would not only give rise to a captain but to a League Champion!
Despite your lofty accomplishments, though, I'd hazard that you still don't know everything that the Trainer School has to teach you, eh? Then allow me to give you a special, expert lesson from the principal herself!
Just as the saying goes, even the fool may give the wise man good counsel if he listens. I may have lost, but heed my advice and use this. It is one of my favorite items.
If your Pok√©mon is holding the King's Rock, its attacks may make an opponent flinch. And that's the end of what I can teach you. I'm glad I was able to meet you here.
If I can defeat himer, then that will mean that our school's principal is stronger than a Champion. And even if I lose, we can still boast that we're the school who helped create a Champion. Oh, it's too good! It's just too good! Ho ho ho! I can't wipe this stupid grin off my face!
Urk. Nothing. I didn't say anything.
