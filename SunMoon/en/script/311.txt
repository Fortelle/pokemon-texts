Phew... This canyon truly is a difficult path to walk. And you even make the Vast Poni Canyon seem like nothing at all, <var>!
But you know what? I've overcome my fears enough to cross even a high bridge like this one!
I am not going to be afraid of heights anymore. Next time I should even be able to tackle that bridge on Mahalo Trail!
Watch this! This is my trial!
Oh...
<var>! I did it! I made it all the way across! I've cleared my trial!
I completed my first trial! Amazing, right, <var>?
Yeah!
It was all right
Hee hee!
Oh, you spoilsport!
But it's really thanks to you, <var>... You're the reason why I've come so far! Still...I think I'll take a little rest here. I'm afraid my legs are still shaking!
<var>, do you want a rest, too?
Don't worry. I've got you covered! I have Hyper Potions and Revives and even lots of Ethers, too. Though I'm not sure I brought enough Max Repels for a path like this one...
