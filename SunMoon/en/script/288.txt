<var>!
Hey, and it's Lillie...isn't it?! What happened to you?!
Yes, it's me! Now I'm ready to use my full force, too!
You look...fantastic!
What was that?
I'm going to train even harder! I've gotta do more!
I keep getting saved by <var> and hiser Pokémon, don't I?
That's not enough. I've gotta be able to save Pokémon on my own! If I can't do that, I'll never be an island kahuna. I'll never be able to make people really smile!
And I still haven't even done Acerola's trial or anything. I've got a lot of catching up to do.
Sorry for dragging you into our family mess.
Yeah... But we got to see things that almost no one would ever get the chance to see! Maybe if I set out to train harder, I'll get to see more amazing things like that again!
Yeah. Our mother does like to do things on an... extravagant scale.
I was really glad that you came, too, Hau.
I can get you to the next island at least. Poni Island. I'll wait for you at the docks.
Come on, <var>! Let's show the world what we can really do!
Guess I should wish you guys a good trip, huh? I'm gonna train up myself and my team real good before I see you again, <var>. Be ready for the shock of a lifetime!
