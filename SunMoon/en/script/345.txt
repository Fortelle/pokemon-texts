Oh yeah, now you're the Pokémon League Champion!
Wouldn't it be nice if it was that simple? The truth is, there's one more person you have to battle if you want that title.
And of course that Trainer is me. Woo!
One final hurrah for your island challenge. And a special tribute as you and this Pokémon League embark on a new path! Let's have a battle worthy of this moment!
Amazing! It's like I told you before, the strongest moves you can use are the ones a Trainer and their Pokémon choose together in the heat of the moment—when it really counts. And you just proved me right! Congrats, cousin. You're a Champion we can all be proud of.
I told you, didn't I? Up there on Mount Hokulani.
Man, the Pokémon and the Trainers in Alola really are the best! I want everyone in the world to know that, too! That's always been my dream!
And right here, right now, it finally came true! And it's all thanks to you, <var>! You and your <var>!
