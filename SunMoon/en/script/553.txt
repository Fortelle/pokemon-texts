Alola is so interesting because it has all these different architectural styles thanks to so many people coming here from all over!
I live my life in search of pleasure. I wonder if I'd find something new to enjoy if I went through the island challenge once again.
The bellhop is the first member of the hotel staff that a guest encounters when they arrive. First impressions are very important. Just as important as the first move you have your first Pokémon use in a Pokémon battle!
When a bellhop moves up the ranks, he can become a bell captain!
Yay! The Pelipper is flying!
I wanna get carried around in Pelipper's beak, too! Take me somewhere!

Pika? Shoo shoo.
Master Chuuster... This is your first vacation in three years! Please forget that you are a famous star, and just enjoy being a regular Pikachu for once!
