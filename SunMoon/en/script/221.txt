Yo, yo, yo! Hold up, yo, Mr. Kukui!
You say you wanna make a Pokémon League? You got rocks in your skull?
Four turns!
Huh?
Bring it on, the both of you! I've been researching Pokémon moves, yeah, so I'm always ready, oh yeah! I'll take you both on in a Battle Royal, and you'll be down with just a Swift and Incinerate or two! You gotta beat the man to be the man, boys!
Yo, for real?
F-fine! You asked for it!
Get 'em good, Professor!
You numskulls should learn your place!
Battle Royal, huh? Nice idea there, Kukui. You can beat down three Pokémon at once, huh?
It's Guzma...
The boss has graced us with his presence!
