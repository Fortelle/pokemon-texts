Thanks for stopping by!
Welcome to Lush Jungle, the trial grounds for me, Mallow!
I knew it the first time I saw you and your team... You've chosen only the finest ingredients! That's why I'm gonna make you help meâ€”er, no! I mean, that's why you should try my trial!
You are the one who got a Sparkling Stone straight from Tapu Koko, aren't you? You're so totally ready for this!
Ah, the breath of the jungle... I can tell just what today's special should be...
Yup! It's gotta be! My personal specialty: the Mallow Special!
I'm gonna need you to find four ingredients for me! I'll need a Mago Berry, a Tiny Mushroom, a Revival Herb, and a Miracle Seed!
Here you go! I brought you a Forage Bag to hold all the ingredients gathered for your trial.
If you put the trial ingredients in your own bag, they'd get mixed up with your stuff, right?
When you're hunting for ingredients, you're gonna want to rely on Stoutland's help. It'll find things that you don't see, after all. You remember what I told you at the farm, right? Just press the B Button to use Stoutland Search!
OK, one more time! There are four things you need to get for me to clear your trial! A Mago Berry, a Tiny Mushroom, a Revival Herb, and a Miracle Seed! You got that?

OK, then here in Lush Jungle...
It's time for Mallow's trial to begin!
I'm gonna need you to find four ingredients for me! I'll need a Mago Berry, a Tiny Mushroom, a Revival Herb, and a Miracle Seed! Don't forget to get a helping paw from Stoutland during the trial!
What? Could it be?! You want to leave the jungle?! You'll have to start this trial over from scratch! Is that OK with you?
Well, come back to the trial whenever you've got your items and your mind right!
OK! Then get out there and find my ingredients!
