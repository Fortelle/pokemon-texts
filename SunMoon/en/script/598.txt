When you are collecting Berries, sometimes a wild Pokémon jumps out at you... It's like nature's little surprise!
If you make it through all of Route 4's twists and turns, you'll reach Paniola Town. That's where Captain Kiawe's house is.
Pokémon that are traded between people get more Exp. Points than those you catch in the wild, so they are a real pleasure to train!
Maybe I should buy the TM for Protect? Being able to avoid an opponent's attack altogether can be used in all kinds of ways.
Krow! Krow!
