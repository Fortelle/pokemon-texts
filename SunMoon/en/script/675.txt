I visited a restaurant with the same name in Kalos one time... Hm! Suddenly I really want to drink tea!
Amazing... This place makes everyone feel like a high roller!
Dhelmise creates whirlpools to suck in and catch other Pokémon. Fishermen in Alola have learned to target its whirlpools and catch Pokémon there, too!
Bruxish is a Pokémon that puts fear even into Pokémon like Sharpedo! That's why lifeguards on the beaches often help out and get helped out by Bruxish— because they help keep the beaches safe. Boy, that takes me back to the days of my own youth spent on the beach...
The washbasins they keep in Pokémon Centers have been infused with some of Comfey's own healing components. That's why they smell so good.
Fff...
Phew, am I ever starving... Which one of the Z-Kaiseki sets should I get?
