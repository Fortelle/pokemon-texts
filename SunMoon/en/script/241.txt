Back so soon, hmm? I wasn't expecting you just yet.
It takes these dumb Grunts way too long to deal with you kids...
So I guess it's my turn now!
What? I told you before. Next time you get in our way, I'm not holding anything back!
Hmmph. Guess you are pretty tough. Now I understand why my Grunts waste so much time battling kids.
But if you want us to return the Pok√©mon, then you'll have to come to us. Alone. The boss is dying to meet you, hmmph! See you at our base in Po Town!
Sorry... There were too many of them for me to stop...
Ugh... Battles you can't afford to lose aren't any fun...
This him? The kahuna's grandson? No wonder he put up a decent fight!
What's going on here?! Seriously, what is going on?!
Hey! Are you guys OK?!
