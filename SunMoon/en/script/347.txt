Here she is! The first Pokémon League Champion from Alola! This calls for celebration, so let's all get to it!
<var>... Congratulations on becoming the Champion!
It's amazing, isn't it? All these people are here just to help you celebrate this achievement, <var>...
Everyone looks so happy... The adults, the children...even the Pokémon!
It...it hasn't all been easy... but I'm really glad that I came to Alola!
Getting to meet you, <var>... No... it wasn't just meeting you. It was traveling together with you. I'm so glad I got to be a part of that journey!
Hey, <var>... It looks like the party is going to keep on going strong for some time still, wouldn't you say? Do you think...maybe...we could sneak out for a second and visit the Ruins of Conflict? I heard from Kahuna Hala that the bridge has been fixed.
Sure!
What about the festival?
I think Tapu Koko must be waiting... I'm sure it's waiting for you to come to it, <var>... now that you finished your island challenge.
Really, <var>! We should go and tell Tapu Koko properly... how you finished your island challenge!
