You are all unharmed... Oh, thank goodness...
Yeah, maybe. But there is still a ton we have to do...
There's the president and Guzma, who both disappeared into the Ultra Wormhole...
Not to mention Cosmog and why it stopped moving like that...
Even if she is...like that, Lusamine is still our mother. We can't just leave her in the beast's world.
We might be able to reach other worlds if we had Alola's Legendary Pokémon on our side. The people of Alola worship it, but I don't know if it's even real...
Of course it is! After all, the beasts are real. I'm sure we can find it. We'll find the Legendary Pokémon!
Everything'll be fine
You're right
I have to thank you both... Both you, <var>, and you, Hau...
But...now it's my turn to do something.
I took Nebby and ran away with it, but running away didn't actually change anything... This time I have to stand up to my mother and face her head on!
I will give it everything I have! I'll find my own kind of Z-Power!
Lillie, you're amazing...
Miss Lillie... if you and your friends would like to get some rest first, I have prepared a few beds in the staff's residential quarters...
We'll take you up on that.
Yeah, I'm beat!
I think...I'll sleep here. In the bed that I once shared with my mother when I was small... Just one last time...
