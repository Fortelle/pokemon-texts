I'm a Pokémon Nursery lady. I help take care of the Pokémon of Trainers like you. Lately, for some reason, I see some Pokémon holding Eggs. It's mysterious, isn't it? If you want us to take care of your Pokémon, please speak to my sister inside the building.
Alola! <var> is doing just fine!
Alola! <var> and <var> are doing just fine! They really seem to like hanging out!

Oh hey! I have surprising news for you! Your Pokémon was holding an Egg! It's like a total mystery where it came from, but you want the Egg your Pokémon was holding, right?
You received the Egg from the Pokémon Nursery lady.
Please take good care of it!
Oh your party is full... Please come back again after making space for the Egg.
I'll keep it if you don't want it, but you want it, don't you?
Then I'll take it. Thank you.
Hi, I'm a Pokémon Nursery lady. We can take up to two of your Pokémon.
Hi, I'm a Pokémon Nursery lady. Would you like us to take care of your Pokémon?
OK. Come back another time.
Oh, my little sister was looking for you!
If you leave the Pokémon with me, you won't be able to battle. Please come back again with more Pokémon.
Which Pokémon shall I take care of?
Don't be silly. That's an Egg!
All right. I'll take care of your <var> for a while.
Come back again after a while.
We can take up to two of your Pokémon. Would you like to leave one more Pokémon?
You have very energetic Pokémon, don't you? Do you want to take one back?

If you want your <var> back now, it will cost you $<var>.
You don't seem to have enough money...
You took back your <var> from the Pokémon Nursery lady.
Do you want to take the other one back, too?
Oh... If you leave a Pokémon with me, you'll be left with only the one. Catch some more Pokémon and come back.
Your party is full! Make room, and then come see me again.
