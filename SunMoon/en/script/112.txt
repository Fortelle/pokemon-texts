Hey, Prof, are you sure this old thing's really seaworthy?
Hey now! Don't you go calling my boat old! She's not old... Call her a classic. Well seasoned, yeah?
I quite like that it has a sense of history...
Pew!
Hey, <var>! If you're all done with catching Pok√©mon and shopping, yeah, you wanna head out with us?
Oh yeah! Time to sail away. Woo!
No sweat, <var>. Finish up whatever you want to do on Melemele. Though you can always come back anytime!
I heard that every island has different-flavored malasada! Man, I can't wait to try 'em all!
The next island... It's too far away to see with the naked eye.
