You know that Verdant Cavern place, right? I guess it's kinda, like, sacred to Tapu Koko.
You aren't even allowed to go into it unless you're on your island challenge.
Oh yeah! Almost forgot! I have something pretty amazing to share with you, <var>. You lucky thing!
Revives are solid items to have! If your Pokémon faints in battle and can't go on, then a Revive will perk 'em right back up! But you probably won't find Revives here. Didja know that Poké Marts sometimes sell different things? And not just that! The two clerks at the counter even sell different things from one another!
I think I'll get myself a treat at the café to pump myself up before trying the first trial!
Mmm, Pinap Juice! I love it!
