Hi. There's this Pokémon that I'm looking for. I want <var>. Do you have one? Would you trade it for my <var>?
Thank you! I'll be good to your <var>, so please be nice to my <var>!
Wait! That Pokémon isn't <var>. I guess you don't want to trade with me.
Oh, OK. If you change your mind, please come see me. I'll be waiting!
Thank you for trading with me! I really wanted this Pokémon, so I promise to take good care of it!
Sorry! I can't trade with a person who has only one Pokémon.
Hello! You're a Pokémon Trainer, aren't you? Have you caught <var>? Will you trade it for my <var>?
Thank you, thank you! I'll take good care of your <var>, so please take good care of my <var>!
Hmm... That is not <var>... When you can trade, let me know.
I see. If you change your mind, please let me know!
Yay! I'm so happy! I'll take very good care of your Pokémon!
Uh-oh. Sorry. I can't trade with a Trainer who has only one Pokémon.
I have Bounsweet. The Pokémon is perfect for Brooklet Hill. If you'd like, please trade it for your Lillipup.
Let's trade!
Huh? That's not Lillipup. If you want to trade with me, speak to me again!
Wha—? You don't want to trade? Let me know when you want to trade with me!
Wow! Lillipup is so cute! Bounsweet is indescribably cute, too! So please take good care of my Pokémon!
Huh? You have only one Pokémon? I can't trade with you unless you have two.
My Poliwhirl... I can't make up my mind whether I should evolve it to Poliwrath or Politoed... Argh. Please trade it for your Zubat!
Whoopie! I'm super happy! I'll be nice to your Zubat, so please be nice to my Poliwhirl!
Zubat! Zubat! Zubat! What I want is Zubat!
See you!
That Poliwhirl has a Waterium Z! So please use Water-type Z-Power!
I heard that you can't trade unless you have two Pokémon!
Please trade my Happiny for your Pancham!
Bye-bye, Happiny. Come on, Pancham.
Argh! I told you that I want Pancham!
OK. Maybe next time.
Please give lots of love to my Happiny! I'll take good care of your Pancham and make it evolve into Pangoro!
Wherever you are, the rule is the same. You can't trade unless you have at least two Pokémon!
Hey. Do you have Haunter? Trade it for my Graveler if you have one. I want to see if the rumors about it are true.
My Graveler was born in Alola and has a Rockium Z! If you'd like, trade my Graveler for your Haunter.
No, no, no! If you don't trade it for Haunter, I'll make my Graveler use Explosion!
I'll be waiting!
Whoa! The Graveler I gave you evolved into another Pokémon?! So the rumor was true!
Wahaha! Don't be ridiculous! You can't trade when you have only one Pokémon in your party!
Do you wan' a Steenee? I wan' a Granbull.
Thanks. I'll be good to your Granbull, so be nice to my Steenee.
Didn't I tell you that I want Granbull?
It's not that easy to say good-bye to your Pokémon... If you change your mind, come see me.
My Steenee's Sp. Def is off the charts! It has a Grassium Z, so you should use Z-Power.
Oh? If you want to trade, at least two Pokémon should be with you.
My Talonflame takes great pride in its Speed! Let's trade Pokémon! Let's see. I want Bewear!
Both your Bewear and my Talonflame will have a new journey!
Hey! What I want is Bewear!
Oh well, if you change your mind, trade Pokémon with me, all right?
I'll conquer the Battle Tree with this Bewear! You, too, get ahead with that Talonflame!
Seriously? You can't trade Pokémon unless you have at least two Pokémon!
