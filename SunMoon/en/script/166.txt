Ahh, no way... Just when things were startin' to heat up, yo, I got surrounded by Diglett and beat up, yo! Yo, since when can Diglett use Beat Up?!
I'm so mad that now I want to beat up on some fools. Don't be mad 'cause you were the fool who was dumb enough to be here right now.
<var>!
Aue! I was wondering who you were playing around with without me, and it's Team Skull!
You want some? That's how we say hello! Nice knowing you, punks!
Yo, step off! Enough with the beating up, yo!
We may not be trying to take over the world or nothing, but we're still hard as bone out here!
See you on the flip side!
Man, <var>, when I fight with you... It's like even my Pok√©mon feel more at ease! You really are some kind of Trainer. That's it! I've just gotta give you something!
Max Ethers will restore all the PP to one of your moves, you know? Pretty great, right?
Now I'm gonna go have some more fun with those Diglett! See ya!
