<var>... we just have to keep going, right! But then again...you are a Trainer, aren't you? I suppose you always keep moving forward!
Wait there.
Eek!
I-I'm sorry. I don't think we've been introduced...
Ho ho ho! I'm Hapu's old gran. Are you two friends with my girl?
Yes, we are
How did you guess?
Ho ho ho! So she has friends now!
Ho ho ho! You'd tease an old woman, eh?
Traveling around the islands... making new friends... You kids are luckier than you know.
If you want to head for the Poni Island ruins, how about a bit of help from this old gran? Here. Hand over your Ride Pager a moment.
Machamp was registered to your Ride Pager!

You'll need to move some big obstacles to make it down the path that you two hope to travel.
I wish you both a bright future.
My Hapu was heading for the Ruins of Hope, wasn't she? Go after her. First, you'll come to Poni Breaker Coast. You'll know it by the soilâ€”it's black as pitch. Go through there, and you'll find the ruins.
Thank you very much, ma'am! You have been a great help!
The Ruins of Hope... that is where the guardian of Poni Island will be. That is where Tapu Fini lives. Let's go!
