<var>...
You've come all this way with me...
That's right. Didn't you notice? You passed through the Captain's gate by my side. Which means that you will undergo my trial!
To clear my trial, you must defeat the great Totem Pokémon known as the lord of the ocean!
That spray of water you can see there! That is where you will probably find the totem. And perhaps those Wishiwashi you battled against will also want their revenge... Defeat whatever comes at you and prove your strength to me!
And remember that you cannot catch any Pokémon here unless you complete my trial. So let the trial begin!



Defeat the totem that is causing all that sea spray, and prove your strength to me. And...well, you may find that using Grass- or Electric-type moves will be to your advantage. Or you could always resort to using an X Sp. Def or two or perhaps a Dire Hit. Do not let your guard down. The totem is not to be trifled with.
So you're back, <var>... Though you bowed out of my trial once.
