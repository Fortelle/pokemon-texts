My, my...what naughty children. You should just lay your heavy heads down.
But I knew that you would struggle onward— I could see through every action you would take. So I knew you would try to reach the president.
And that is why! I knew that I would be able to ambush you here and remedy my previous failure. The only reason I let you in the lower floor was to buy time to gather more staff to stop you.
So, uh, Mr. Faba, do you have the key to the president's rooms?
Indeed! I have it right here.
So...if you'd just stayed hidden, we would've been stuck here anyway, right?
What?!
E-enough, you lot! Teach these children a lesson!
We don't have time for this. Help me out here, <var>.
H-h-h-how can this be? To be cornered by mere children?!
Maybe helping one another out isn't so bad...
<var>! Hau! I leave Faba to you!
E-enough! I will show you the true power of Branch Chief Faba! The man who is called Aether Paradise's last line of defense! We will settle this at last with a Multi Battle!

Come on, <var>! Let's show 'em just what our Pokémon are capable of! For Lillie and for Cosmog, too!
I wanna help save Lillie, so I'm going ahead! You don't mind, right?!
Thanks for the key, Mr. Faba!
This is why... This is why I can't bring myself to like children.
