...Ora?
It is holding something out to you... Will you take it?
Take it
Leave it
There you are!
...Mmm.
This fellow here's my partner, Gru the Oranguru. But he just hasn't really taken a liking to me. Maybe he hasn't known me long enough yet. He often gets out on his own like this. I don't know, maybe he feels stressed?
Mmph.
Did he maybe give you something?
Let me remind you that lying to an officer is an offense! I could have you up on charges! So let me ask you one more time...
Ohhh, Gru...! That was locked up in our safe! Oranguru are clever Pok√©mon, so I'm sure Gru here had no problem getting the safe open.
Mmm.
Sigh... Fine. You take it then. Use it however you'd like.
Mmm.
I guess Gru must've gotten this nasty habit of lifting things from his old Trainer. Smart as a whip, but real sticky fingers. It makes him a handful to control, but it's not like I can just ignore him till his old Trainer gets out of jail and comes back for him, right? Sorry for complaining to you about my problems. Here, take this and be on your way.
And don't feel like you've got to pay me back in kind for that Return. Favors don't always need returning. That's not why I'm doing any of this. I just hope this fellow here can straighten out before his old Trainer gets back.
...Mmph.
