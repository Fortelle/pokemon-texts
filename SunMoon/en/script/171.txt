I came here for Nebby. Though... as you saw, I didn't come here myself so much as I was brought here with the professor's help...
Oh! Look at poor <var>. Let me heal it for you, won't you?
Within these ruins waits the guardian deity of Akala Island... This is Tapu Lele's ruin.
Pew!
You! I know you tried to drag me along to the Ruins of Conflict on Melemele Island, too...
Why are these ruins important to you? What do the guardians mean to you?
Just think what would have happened to you if <var> hadn't been there back then...
Pew!!!
Oh, haven't I seen you with Kukui?
Oh! Yes, my name is Lillie. I work as Professor Kukui's assistant. And this is <var>.
Oh! Sorry, I never even asked your name before, did I? Tapu Lele summoned me here to clean up the ruins.
<var>...thanks for getting to know the people and Pok√©mon of Alola.
