Dooot doo doo, just a kahuna on a stroll to the laguna. â™ª
Wait, this disturbance I feel...
Oh, this one's a rare visitor!
You have come before the island kahuna!
Tapu ko-koooo!
Did you come here as a guardian or just to battle?
The other islands must surely be facing the same threat. I'm counting on you, my comrades...
As kahuna of this island, I, Hala, will support you!
