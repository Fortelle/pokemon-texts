<var>! It's been a while since I last saw you around. But weren't you supposed to meet with the professor in Malie Garden?
<var>? Would you mind if I asked you something?
Pew?






You want to go to the ruins?
Is it about Nebby?
Yes. I want to take Nebby to visit Ula'ula's ruins, but they are located deep in a large desert. I don't want to ask that much of you.
Right now, I'm planning to visit Malie Library. There's a book that I want to look for there. Maybe you'd even be willing to help me?
I know that Malie Library is here within the city of Malie somewhere... Even I should be able to find it. I can do this!
Pew!
