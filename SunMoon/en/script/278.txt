Hurry. This way.
Wh-what is this place...?
What do you think? It's my private collection. My precious babies... They will all be preserved for eternity here.
But my poor beast... What confusion, what rage must it feel, arriving in this strange world? It would not be right to confine its feelings in such a small case as these ones... It will need to express itself. I think I will let it express all its fury upon the Alola region as it will!
Whoa! <var>!
Whoa-ho! And Lillie!
Man, I'm so glad to see you're OK!
Ah. Sweet Hau. So you came, too?
Hmph. And Gladion. Must you be so untidy?
Will you listen to me at least? You mustn't open the Ultra Wormhole. You cannot let the beasts run wild!
The daughter who stole my Cosmog from me and the son who took my Type: Null! All I ever did was give you two all the love I had, and all you did was betray me! You have no right to ask for my attention now!
What? Daughter? Son?
Wait! You all are a family?!
Perhaps once we were... Sweet Hau. But those wretches beside you left me.
But it doesn't matter now. None of that matters now!
I was able to open the Ultra Wormhole using just the gases we'd extracted from Cosmog when it was in Aether Paradise, wasn't I?
But now I have Cosmog itself inside this crate here... If I use its entire body, how many Ultra Wormholes will I be able to open? How many sweet beasts will come to me then?
Please... Stop... If Nebby isn'tâ€” If you make it use up too much of its power... you don't understand what will happen!
Like when we ran away from the Paradise... it couldn't even move for ages after that...
If you use too much of its power, it will die!
Watch... I will open the Ultra Wormhole for you... Come to me, my sweet beast!
