My Pok√©mon just tried a just-fried malasada!
Goosh!
The entire showcase is filled with rows of malasada after malasada!
Did you know that the name malasada comes from a phrase meaning "poorly cooked?" I don't think there's anything poor about them!
Whenever I hang out with the other ladies from the office, they always humble-brag about their families while pretending to be complaining. I'd much rather hang out here by myself and see if I can set a new record for the most malasada eaten in a single sitting!
