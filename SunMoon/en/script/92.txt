Let me formally welcome you to Verdant Cavern! I am your captain, Ilima.
Allow me to explain the basics of my trial.
What you should attempt to do is...
Defeat three of the Pokémon that lurk here in their dens!
Then reach the pedestal deep within the cave... and collect the Z-Crystal there!
You'll need to be completely in sync with your Pokémon to succeed.
Grrrr!
Oh dear! And there's one more thing I forgot to mention.
Many strong Pokémon make their home in this cave, but one stronger and more fearsome than all the rest, known as a Totem Pokémon, also resides here! It will be the greatest obstacle you face as you attempt to clear my trial!
By the way, until you clear the trial, you will not be able to catch Pokémon in Verdant Cavern.
This is but one of the seven trials you will face during your island challenge.
And it begins now! The trial of Captain Ilima!
Let the Verdant Cavern trial of Ilima...begin!
Not sure what to do? It's quite simple. Defeat the three Pokémon, reach the pedestal at the back of the cave, and get the Z-Crystal.
Now all you need do is claim the Z-Crystal from the pedestal!
Ki-ki-ki-kiii!
The Totem <var> is a formidable opponent for any Trainer to take on. It is a Normal-type Pokémon, so perhaps you should battle back with Fighting-type Pokémon or moves!
