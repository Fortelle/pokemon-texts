Wicke. These two are still in the middle of their island challenge, aren't they? Please deliver them to their next island.
O-oh! At once, ma'am!
I will go to check that none of our poor resident Pok√©mon came to any harm. And I need to speak with Mr. Faba about exactly what happened downstairs.
And of course... I will have to start preparing the foundation for our newest and perhaps greatest duty yet: the protection of the Ultra Beasts!
I'll see the two of you to Ula'ula Island, then.
