Greetings. Captain Ilima here.
As you travel around the islands of Alola, you will find captains' barricades here and there.
These barricades help mark areas where particularly strong Pok√©mon can be found. Anyone can pass through them, of course, if they are escorted by a strong Trainer. Those attempting the island challenge can pass the barricades, as long as they clear the trials.
Are you ready? Then behold the power of a captain!
Voila! Your world just got a little bigger.
I am the only captain here on Melemele Island, meaning my trial is the only one here.
Now that you have cleared the trial, please inform our island kahuna, Hala!
