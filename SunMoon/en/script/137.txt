So! <var>, Hau. How are your trials going? I hope you and your Pokémon are working hard and havin' a blast. Woo!
But, Mr. Masked Royal... How'd you even know that we're doing our trials right now? Oh! I get it! Because of our amulets, huh?
Well, I'm having a blast!
But why are you here? Why would you even wanna do a Battle Royal?
Because Null and I have to make it on our own. And I don't ever want to forget that.
...Wow. You're just a ray of sunshine, eh? I think you'd have a lot more fun if you just let yourself have a good time with everybody else. You can do a lot more together, too!
Well, I don't know what his deal is, but I thought that battle was just plain fun! That's why I like doing Battle Royals. And my Pokémon seem to like them, too!
