What a stunning sunset! All right, today's the day that I finally unpack—
Was that the doorbell? Go see who it is, <var>.
Hey there, <var>! It's about time we set out for the festival, yeah!
But first...
Now that you're a real Pokémon Trainer with your own Pokémon and all, I've gotta show you something. Come with me out to Route 1!
Have fun at the festival, sweetie! I'm sure you'll have a good time with your new Pokémon pal!
Me and Meowth will be sure to unpack every last box here—you'll see!
Mreee?!
Mrowr!
