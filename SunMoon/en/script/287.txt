I picked these clothes up in Malie... Do you think they suit me?
Sure do
I don't know...
Oh, <var>... Thank you!
Oh, <var>! I'm really trying hard here, you know!
I feel like there's so much I have to do now... to save Nebby... to save my mother...
I...I want to be like you, <var>. I want to be strong enough to face any trial.
That's why I'm going to try my hardest! This is my Z-Powered form!
So this is where you were.
I found this downstairs.
It's the Sun Flute. It's apparently an artifact from Alola's past. They say it's to be played under the sun's light.
It's the Moon Flute. It's apparently an artifact from Alola's past. They say it's to be played under the moon's light.
The Sun Flute and the Moon Flute. When sounded together, it's said that they can call the Legendary Pokémon... That is, if you believe in old myths, anyway.
Looks to me like that woman was even planning to add the Legendary Pokémon to her little collection here.
Here. Take this with you.
It's a Master Ball. It can catch any Pokémon without fail.
I'm counting on you to help Lillie. This is the least I can do.
But...what are you going to do, Gladion?
Deal with this mess. I've got to clean up Aether Paradise.
I'd wanted to get as far away from this place as I could, together with Null... but in the end, it looks like I ended up right back here again...
