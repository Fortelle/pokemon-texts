Bull! Baw!
If it's not urgent, could you come back later? Sorry, but I'm on my break right now.
Bull! Baw!
What's the matter, partner? Do you smell a case?
What seems to be the trouble? Has there been a theft? A kidnapping? Just leave it up to the top crime-fighting duo of the Konikoni Police Station!
Bull?
I know my partner's face might look a little scary, but he's a lovable old lug. Nobody in the world can make a lost little kid smile as quick as he can!
You just leave everything up to us, the number one problem-solving duo in town! Hm? You want to know why we're number one?
It's because we're the only duo in town! Hahahahaha!
It's that obvious just from looking at us, huh! Hahahahaha!
Here, take this and remember Konikoni's number one duo!
Our duo has nothing to do, but that's perfectly fine by me!
