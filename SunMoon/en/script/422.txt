Hello, young one. Are you interested in becoming a Berry master?
You look quite promising. All right. First of all, get a Persim Berry!
Oho? Are you being shy? If you want to become a Berry master, don't be shy. Just talk to me.


Let me see. Did you get a Persim Berry?
Whoa! You have a Persim Berry! I don't know if you picked it from a Berry tree or your Pokémon had it, but that's a great start to becoming a Berry master! I'll offer this as a reward.
A Persim Berry heals confusion! A Pecha Berry heals poison status! And a Sitrus Berry restores more HP than an Oran Berry!
Alola is great! You can get plenty of Berries without planting Berries in a Berry field! But some Pokémon gather around trees trying to get Berries as well!
Mufufu! If you get a Persim Berry, please show it to me.
