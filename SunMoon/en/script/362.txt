Alola! I am the official Name Rater! I can more or less tell your Pokémon's fortune by its name. Want me to rate the nicknames of your Pokémon?
Which Pokémon's nickname should I rate for you?
Hmmm. <var>, is it? You picked quite a fine nickname. But I think we could give it something even better. What do you say?
I see! What would you like the new nickname to be?
Done! From now on, this Pokémon shall be known as <var>! You're right, that does seem to fit it better. Nicely done!
OK! Come see me again if you change your mind.
Done! From now on, this Pokémon shall be known as <var>! It looks no different from before, but we both know this name is vastly superior! How fortunate for you!
Hmmm. <var>! That is a truly impeccable nickname! I can't say anything bad about it! Take good care of <var>!
Now, now... That is merely an Egg!
Or do you want to quit giving the Pokémon a nickname and change back to the name that the Pokémon had when you two met?
Yes, yes. <var>! It reminds you of the time when you first met the Pokémon! Come see me again if you want to give Pokémon nicknames.
