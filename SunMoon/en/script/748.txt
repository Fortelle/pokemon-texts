Welcome to Aether Paradise. The Pokémon sanctuary is on the upper floor.
A good Trainer catches Pokémon to raise them with all due care. That's a kind of refuge, too.
The president is such a nice lady. She invites trial-goers like us here to tour the Aether Foundation.
They say we're to ship these greens that Farfetch'd like to eat to other lands. Here, why don't you take one, too?
Apparently the Farfetch'd populations have been dropping in other regions because they can no longer find as many of these greens that have traditionally been their food source.
We're here to study how things are done here at the foundation. The goals of this place are pretty much in direct opposition to Fuchsia City's Safari Zone.
STAFF ONLY! All others will not be permitted entry!
Excuse me! Yes, you there! I know I'm too far to catch you from here— But no one is allowed through there but staff! Please step away! P-please...
Rauw?!
