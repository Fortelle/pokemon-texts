Oh! You've got to be a trial-goer, right? Well, you've got a good sense of timing!
The captain's actually here now, so come on!
Thanks for stopping by!
The Moomoo Milk from Paniola Ranch is the best. It's so rich and creamy when you use it in white sauce and other things... Mmm! The taste can't even be described!
Oh, by the way! Since I was lucky enough to run into you here, I'll do you a little favor.
Stoutland was registered to your Ride Pager!
See, Stoutland can sniff out items for you that are buried in the dirt where you can't even see them! When you're riding Stoutland, pressing the B Button to use that Stoutland Search is what it's all about! Get up there and try it! There's all kinds of stuff laying around waiting for you to find it!
If you go all the way down Route 5, you'll come out on Brooklet Hill. My friend Lana is up there, so say hi to her for me if you see her!






Stoutland can help you find hidden items in the ground that you can't see with your eyes!
