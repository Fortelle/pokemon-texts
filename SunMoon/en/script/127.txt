Brooklet Hill... Within it lies the Legendary Pokémon said to be the embodiment of the sea itself... the mighty Kyogre.
That's amazing!
Really?
It was only a joke, <var>... You're rather trusting, aren't you?
Oh dear... You won't be tricked easily, <var>.
But we are near the sea. If that splashing sound is coming from the sea... then I wonder what is causing it. And now it is raining, as well. The rain will boost the power of any Water-type moves by half again... Could those splashes be caused by some Pokémon whose moves are now growing ever stronger in the falling rain?
