I've been waiting for you! Now let me explain about the Reassembly Unit.
Sina... You don't waste even a second.
Have you been collecting Zygarde's Cells and Cores?
You've collected fewer than 10 Cells and Cores combined...
You've collected 10 or more Cells and Cores combined.
Anyway, I'll explain!
The Reassembly Unit is a device that has something to do with the Pokémon Zygarde. The machine is capable of assembly and separation of Zygarde.
Assembly is...to create a Pokémon called Zygarde! Now, Dexio, it's your turn.
Oh...Sina, Sina, Sina... Anyway... There are two ways to assemble Zygarde. One is to add Cells you collected to Zygarde.
The other is to create a new Zygarde with only Cells!
Next we'll explain about separation.
To separate Zygarde... it means to return Zygarde to its Cells!
Separated Cells will be returned to the Zygarde Cube.
For your information, according to the research by the professor who's sent us to Alola, Zygarde is divided into 100 Cells and Cores.
Depending on the number of Cells and Cores, the shape of Zygarde will be different... In other words, Zygarde changes its Forme!
Zygarde is said to maintain the order of the Kalos region...then why is it in Alola...? Is it a sign that something is about to happen?
If you collect Zygarde's Cells and Cores, you may get the answer. Anyhow... we'll be taking our leave now! Bon voyage!
