Yeah, over here!
So you know that wild Pokémon will sometimes jump out at you in the tall grass, yeah?
Now that you've got <var> there, you can not only fight wild Pokémon, yeah... you can also try to catch 'em. Woo!
I'm going to show you how to catch a wild Pokémon, all right? Keep your eyes on the prize!
Oh yeah!
Wild Pokémon do sometimes attack people if they get close, but catch 'em and they'll join your team and be a great help to you, yeah!
But if your Pokémon get all tuckered out by fighting for you, just head home for a bit. If you ask your mom, I'm sure she'll let you and your whole team rest up at home. Or you could use some Potions!
Here're some Poké Balls and Potions to get you started out.
Why don't you have a little adventure of your own on the way to Iki Town, yeah? Take good care of <var>, <var>!
