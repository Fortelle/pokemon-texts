Poni Island... Almost no one lives on it, but you'll find a whole lot of nature to explore here.
Go. Find the kahuna.
The kahuna of Poni Island also protects the shrine where Alola's people worship the Legendary Pokémon. Maybe they will know something that might help you.
Gladion... thank you for this.
But...but when you took Null and left Aether Paradise two years ago... you left me alone with Mother! She was so bad after you left! If I hadn't had Wicke with me...
I'm sorry... I wasn't there for you when you needed me. All I could think about back then was finding a way to save Null... That was the battle I was fighting. But now you've found your own battle to fight. I know you can handle it.
<var>. I'm OK. You don't have to worry. I know what I have to do now.
And... I don't know. Maybe it sounds strange, but... I'm kind of excited.
Poni Island, here we come! Bzzt-zzt! Wonder what kinds of new Pokémon we'll get to rub elbows with here, eh, <var>? If only I had elbows! Bzzzzzzt!
