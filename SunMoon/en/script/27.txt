Now this is more like it, yeah! Welcome to paradise, cousin. This is the Alola region!
Folks here in Alola get along by living together with Pokémon and working together, too. After all...
You can go anywhere, yeah, as long as you got Pokémon helping you out here.
That's why we gotta get you to the kahuna!
First, we're off to Iki Town! Come on, it's not far if we cut up here.
Hey now! The heat getting to you? I said we go this way!
The power of science is amazing! A simple press of a button and you can trade Pokémon or battle with the people around you!
Mooo-ar!






Enough already, Tauros! Calm down! You're going to hurt somebody!
