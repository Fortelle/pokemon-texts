The Ruins of Hope...
What is this place...? The air feels so oppressive...
But...but if we go in there... maybe Nebby will return to normal!
The people believe that the guardian deity of these ruins, Tapu Fini, can wash away any impurities with its mystic water...
That sounds promising
You think that'll work?
That's right it does, <var>! I'm going to give it my all so that we can return Nebby back to normal!
Oh, honestly, <var>! I'm going to make sure that Nebby gets right back to normal, just to show you!
So just you wait, Nebby! This time I'm going to be the one who saves you!
Come on, <var>! Let's go!
Ni-hiiii!
