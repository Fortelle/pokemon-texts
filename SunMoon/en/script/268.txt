Did you find anything?
We learned a bit about Cosmog! Like, it might be an Ultra Beast or whatever... and if you stress it a lot, it can create Ultra Wormholes! Maybe to run away or something?
If you stress it... If you hurt itâ€”is that what you mean? Was that why she ran away with it?
But we didn't find any sign of it down here.
Yeah... Faba probably knew this would be a dead end.
Darn... Did he outsmart us?
Gladion never really explains anything, eh? Probably thinks it makes him look cool...
Should we go after him? We all got into this together. Might as well see it to the end together!
