Meowth, use Fake Out! Make your opponent flinch!
Meh heh...
Look at your Pokémon... Whether it has any claws or not now, it would probably get a kick out of this one.
In Pokémon battles, the Pokémon with the highest Speed stat gets to act first. But with a Quick Claw, your Pokémon should be able to attack first, regardless of its Speed. Or sometimes, anyway. It's better than nothing!
Some items don't do anything unless you give them to a Pokémon to hold.
