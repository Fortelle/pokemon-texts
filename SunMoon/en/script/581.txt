If you use the Vs. Recorder, you can not only rewatch old Link Battles you had with others... You can even hold mock battles against the teams captured in the Battle Video! That's why Battle Videos are the best!
If you use Battle Teams, you can not only register six special teams from your Boxes... You can even register the same Pokémon to more than one Battle Team at a time! That's why Battle Teams are the best!
