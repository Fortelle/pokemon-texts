Pew!
You look very pleased, don't you?
By the way, Lillie, this might be a weird question, but... Why even come to the Ruins of Life if you're not a Trainer?
Oh. Because of Nebby... It's not originally from here, and I want to help it get back to its home... But I don't have any idea how to do that... It seems fond of the ruins for some reason, so I keep visiting them and hoping that maybe I will find some clue to help it...
Pew?
You certainly don't see Pokémon like that every day. Tapu Lele may be called the guardian deity of our island, but it can also run wild at times. Regular Pokémon normally avoid the guardians at all costs... Unless they are strong enough to face the tapu themselves, that is.
Wait, that can't be right...
I think your journey will hold many surprises. And I hope it holds many joys.
I'll take you back to town, Lillie. You're doing everything you can for your partner, even though you're not a Trainer. I like that kind of person, so I can't help but give you a hand!
