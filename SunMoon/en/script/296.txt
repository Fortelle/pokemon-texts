If we're going to break a path, we'll need to move these huge rocks!
That's what Hapu's grandmother said, isn't it?
...Unghhh!
I don't think I can do this... I-it's heavier than words can even express...
We'll have to borrow Machamp's formidable strength for this task. I read about it once in a book. If I remember right, it said... "When getting a ride from a powerful Machamp, Trainers can activate Machamp's Shove by standing before a rock and pressing [0xE001]!" And if we find ourselves getting frustrated, we should probably remember to step outside again for a bit of perspective.
When Hapu spoke of an "odd little thing" from the sky...do you think she meant a beast? What do you think Hapu brought us here for? So many of the things that Trainers do are still a mystery to me...
