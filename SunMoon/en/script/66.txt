Hey there, <var>! I must've passed you two somehow, yeah?
But welcome to the Trainers' School, the place to learn how to be a Pokémon Trainer!


Professor Kukui! Is this the child you told me about?
Yeah. Put himer through the wringer, Teach!
Four Trainers!
You've got to beat four Pokémon Trainers here at the school, <var>! The experience will surely help you and your Pokémon grow stronger, yeah. Actually... Speaking of experience, why don't you take this.
If you keep that Exp. Share on, yeah, all the Pokémon on your team can get Exp. Points from battle.
The Trainers who will take part in this lesson may be inside or outside the school.
You may also want to visit our classrooms. You'll be sure to learn a lot.


All right. Let the lesson begin!
She may not look all that tough, but that teach trains her kids right! One of her students is even a captain!
If you want a bit of advice from me, here's something that might help. Once you've fought a species of Pokémon once, you can easily see what types of moves will work best on it in your next battle.
Wandering about in the tall grass to meet lots of different Pokémon'll help with that! Battle all the time, oh yeah!
Seeing a Pokémon in pain makes my own heart seem to ache. You can come talk to me anytime that you want your team's health restored. I'm happy to help.
Let me take care of poor <var>, OK?
Please try not to push your Pokémon too hard... Um...I mean...if you don't mind...
