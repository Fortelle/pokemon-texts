Lomi lomi is the style of massage we practice here in Alola. How about a treatment for your Pokémon? It will make them feel more friendly toward you. What do you say? Can I do a little lomi lomi on that <var> you have there?
If you ever want to experience the joys of lomi lomi massage, just stop by our shop here.
Then allow me to just take <var> there for a moment...

There we go! It was a really productive session of lomi lomi. I think you'll notice a lot of friendly feelings!
There we go! I think that lomi lomi session helped inspire some good, friendly feelings toward you.
There we go! I think this session was a good start. It's feeling a bit more friendly toward you already, I'd say.
I can only manage one session of lomi lomi per day, but do feel free to come again tomorrow!
Do you want to know if your Pokémon feel friendly toward you or not?
I understand. Sometimes knowing can be worse than not knowing.
Then I'll have a look at your <var> there, shall I?
My! It feels incredibly close to you! Nothing makes it happier than being with you!
You clearly love your <var>, and you must spend a lot of time together.
Hm. I'd say that you and <var> have the potential to be an even greater combo.
Hmmm. I think...it feels friendly toward you. At least a little...
Hmmm... I'd say that you and your Pokémon still have a long way to go.
What is going on here? Do you let it get knocked out a lot in battles or something? This is bad.
Oh dear. You must be a merciless Trainer... Do you use Frustration or just not know better?
Oh tapu! How could you leave it like this?! Take it to a Pokémon Center right now!
You're curious about an Egg? You must want to meet whatever is inside soon!
