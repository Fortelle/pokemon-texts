Hey! You and me! Let's have a Pokémon battle!
Dahahaha! Where's the fire, boy? And what kind of a Pokémon battle would that be where you don't even give a name first, eh?
Fair enough. Then I'm Hau. And my partner's <var>!
Your <var> looks really cool, too!
Thanks?
You like Pokémon?
Yeah! So let's battle! I couldn't wait for you to find your way to Iki Town, so I've been all over looking for you!
Um... I don't really like to see Pokémon battles where Pokémon can get hurt...but I'll watch for you.
Oh yeah, your first battle already! Just have your Pokémon dish out some moves and see who wins. Woo!
I appreciate you being willing to take on my grandson here. I expect a no-holds-barred battle from the both of you!
Let me see... So we open the X Menu by tapping [0xE002] and then select Save... And that's how we can save our progress to continue again at any time, right?
It's important to save your memories! You can save them by jotting them down so that you don't forget what you've done.
Didja know? When a Rockruff really likes you, it rubs against you with the stones on its neck! But...it does kinda hurt...
Little Hau is a sweet one, eh? Nothing like his fearsome granddad, Hala!
If you treat your Pokémon wrong, the guardian deity will strike you down with lightning! But the children all laugh when I tell them that.
Both sides' Pokémon will give it their all!
Pokémon have been there for me from the day I was born. I'd guess that Pokémon will keep being there for me my whole life!
That Hau is the kahuna's own grandson. Boy, I might just get my hopes up for this battle. I hope it'll be a good one!
The tall grass is like a treasure trove, full of all kinds of Pokémon just waiting to be found!
Come on, Hau! You can do it! And you, too, <var>!
Ruff ruff!
Raff! Raff!
