Ni-hiiii!
It's good to see you again, too, Mudsdale! You look to be in fine form.
Wow... Pokémon Trainers really do amaze me. It seems like a hard path to walk, and even so, you don't let yourself be held back by the fear of seeing your Pokémon friends get hurt... You just keep striving forward together...
Oh! Been a while, <var>. And you brought Lillie along, too?
Yes. It's good to see you, Hapu!
You look different...like you're ready to go all out in something now.
Thank you, Hapu. I've finally discovered what I need to do. So this is my Z-Powered form!
Ho! Then you do your best, Lillie.
No one could call you lily-livered!
Um, so, Hapu...do you know where we can find the kahuna?
The kahuna? Hrmm. Don't have one here on Poni.
What?!
Now what do we do, <var>...?
Hmph... Well, I suppose the time might be right now... I already finished up my battle against that odd little thing that appeared out of the sky...
All right. Let us all proceed to the ruins. You stick with me, you two.
Ni-hiiii!
