Pokémon can learn new moves in an instant, if you use a TM on them.
Careful out here, young Trainer! Haven't you seen the way the grass shakes on Route 2? That rustling grass hides a Pokémon that is dying to pounce on some easy Trainer target! But battling those feisty creatures can be worth it—they sometimes drop items after battle!
Phew... Time for a little rest, I think. Riding may be easier on me, but that doesn't mean my Pokémon doesn't get tired!
If you go ahead through the grass here you can reach the cemetery where Pokémon rest. Many Trainers visit it to pay their respects.
If a Pokémon's move lands as a critical hit, it will deal 50% more damage!
Brrr!



Boy, if only the water in the sea were Soda Pop! Then I could heal my Pokémon...
Siii?
Trainers who take part in the island challenge and its trials get to see their whole world grow!
