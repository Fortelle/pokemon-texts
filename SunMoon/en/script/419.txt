<var>? What are you doing at my place?
Your place?
This is a resort, right?
Oh, my dad owns the Hano Grand Resort, so... Anyway. You're the Champion now, right? So are you out there training every day?
Of course!
Uhhh...what?
Just what I would expect of a Champion! That is very wise thinking. I'm a top-ranking player in the golf world, and that is because I still practice every day.
You're the Champion, aren't you? I'm a top-ranking player in the golf world, and that is because I still practice every day!
I think it's important to keep training every day, even if it's for just a bit. I'll give you this. It should help you aim for even loftier goals!
Many Flying-type Pokémon are fast, right? That's why I use Trick Room to up my handicap. It forces me to train in battles where the slower Pokémon get to move first.
I should get going, though. I've got to get back to my daily training regimen. Ten more hours to go today.
