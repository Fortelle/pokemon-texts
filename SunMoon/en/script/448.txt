Hey there, <var>! Looks like you're really givin' it your all. Yeah! You've got a lot of Pokémon registered in your Pokédex now!
Of course she hazzz! <var> izzz my big boyclever girl! I wouldn't bother hanging out with some lug of a Trainer who couldn't fill a Pokédex! Zz-zz-zz!
Hahaha! Rotom's pretty fired up about it, too! Of course, I am, too! So I've got a little something for you.
When you have a Pokémon hold a Lucky Egg, it grows up faster! Some evolved Pokémon don't appear in the wild, so it's useful to have one of these if you're trying to fill a Pokédex.
