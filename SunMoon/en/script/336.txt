I've been waiting for you. To thank you. For what you did for Lillie. For our mother. I appreciate it. Maybe more than you know.
And the only thing I can offer you in thanks is a great battle. So I'm going to show my full power... My real full power this time! With the Z-Ring that old man gave me!
You've got a good Pokémon. I know what kind of Trainer you are now. And what kind of journey you've been through.
I know why you of all people could save Lillie. Why you could save Cosmog...and Alola.
Lillie wanted me to tell you something. She's looking after our mother at the foundation.
She wanted me to tell you...that you're the best Pokémon Trainer in the world, <var>.
She gave me this. For you.
Hau's working hard to get stronger, too.
Hmph... If you two are going to get even stronger, then I guess I can't let down my guard yet.
I know we aren't friends. But we aren't enemies anymore either. Keep winning. Maybe I'll see you again if you do.
