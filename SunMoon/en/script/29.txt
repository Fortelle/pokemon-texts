So, <var>! You're lovin' Alola already, yeah?
Yeah!
...I guess
That's what I like to hear! The more you love Alola, the happier I'll be!
Hey, don't sweat it, cousin. It's pretty normal to feel a bit unsure when you're in a new place.

Oh yeah! Look there! Looks like an excited Alolan Trainer's come to us!
Professor Kukui! You've gotta recommend another move for me sometime! Please?
Why? You already know which moves you want to use, yeah? You come find me next time your Pokémon learns a new move, and then I'll battle you.
See that? If you had a Pokémon with you, you could dive into the tall grass here, yeah, to try to catch some wild Pokémon to add to your team!
Then Trainers go up against one another in battle with the Pokémon they love!
Come on, Yungoos!
Howzit! You're the new kid that just flew in? Let's have a Pokémon battle sometime!
Having Pokémon gives you a whole new way to communicate with other people, see? Now let's get moving! Iki Town is right over there!
Mooo-ar!

Howzit! You're the new kid that just flew in? Let's have a Pokémon battle sometime!
Hsss!



Enough already, Tauros! Calm down! You're going to hurt somebody!
