Old Hala is here to make you holler!
Your old kahuna is now also a member of the Elite Four. Well, this time I'm holding nothing back! Time for you to see what I can really do!
It is only when the balance of the old and the new is just right that you can create something truly original. That is what I saw in the battle between us. An elder's experience and the fire of youth!
Welcome, Champion, to the Pokémon League, where strength is everything! Now, with love in our hearts, let us clash in Pokémon battle!
A heart-pounding battle like that always sends a shiver through my whole body! I'm sure my Pokémon felt it, too!
Oh ho ho! So it's me who faced you first. Defeating the Elite Four will become a fine part of our island challenge!
Oh ho ho! So I was the second to face you? Some people would say you're halfway there, while some may say you've still got halfway to go. How you see it is up to you.
Oh ho ho! So I was the third to face you? If you'll take a bit of advice from this old man, I wouldn't let my guard down yet if I were you.
Oh ho ho! So I was the last to face you? But then who do you think awaits you in the Champion's chamber?
