Hey! <var>! Glad I ran into you... So we can see who's stronger now! My gramps must've thought I did good enough in my grand trial, 'cause he gave me a Z-Ring, too!
Having a battle in a place like Paniola Town feels like we're in a real old-fashioned Western showdown or something, right? This is so cool! Though if we're real honorable cowboys, we've gotta make sure our teams are healthy first.
Awright, Pikachu and team! Let's show this newbie what Alola's got!
Ma-a-an, that was some kinda battle! Our Pokémon all look like they had a blast, too!
Right then. Here. I'll share my bit of good luck with you, <var>.
You know how the Totem Pokémon are all, like, surrounded by some aura of power? If you use a Dire Hit on your Pokémon and manage to land a critical hit, that aura won't mean a thing!
You know, Pokémon battles are just, like, sometimes you win, sometimes you lose. But you're only really a loser if you don't have any fun while you're at it. Right? Anyway, I'm heading off to Paniola Ranch!
