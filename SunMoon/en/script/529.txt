You know the festival here in Iki Town? Well, some years there are no 11-year-old kids setting out to hold a sacred battle for us. Those years Hala gets to take part and we dedicate a bout of sacred Alolan sumo to the guardian instead!
Kahuna Hala is real strict when it comes to his training. Oh! Not training for Pok√©mon battle or nothing. I'm talking about his sumo training!
That Hala... He's too soft on young Hau. When Hau was just a little thing, he once saw Hala in a real fury and Old Hala's face was so terrible then that the boy burst into tears! Hala couldn't do a thing to console him. I think he's been holding something of himself back in front of Hau ever since that day.
