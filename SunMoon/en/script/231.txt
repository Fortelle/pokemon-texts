Wait up, <var>! So, this is the Aether House, eh?
Strangers!
This means battle!
What? Why?!
We'll protect our home when Acerola's away!
I tried really hard! I am a kid, you know!
Phew... So I won, yeah? Then why's this little fellow still gnawing on me?
Grrrssssss!
I'm ba-a-ack, everybody!
Ha ha ha! Looks like I finished up my shopping spree right on time! You've already met everyone?
Oh yeah, we met all right... In battle anyway. But... Hey, where's Lillie?
I left her with Hapu. They should be coming soon.
So why don't we get those trials done first? You did know I'm the captain, right?
These ankle biters are starting to grow on me. I think I might hang out for a while. It's kinda soothing, you know?
My trial takes place at the abandoned site where the supermarket used to be. I'll wait out front of Aether House to show you the way, if you'd like!
Everybody lives together with Pok√©mon here at Aether House.
The Aether Fun-day-shun pays for everything!
