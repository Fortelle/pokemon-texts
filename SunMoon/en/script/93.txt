I'm a Trial Guide, here to help young boys and girls attempting the island challenge.
Looks like there isare <var> more Pokémon for you and your team to prove yourself against.
Fantastic! You proved your strength to all three Pokémon! Then go right ahead inside!
Going somewhere? The goal of the trial is to get the Z-Crystal, remember?
It's pretty tough to even attempt the trial. And you managed to get a Z-Crystal and finish! You'll be a Trainer to keep an eye on!
Ooh, sorry, but I can't let you through here till you beat all three Pokémon you were asked to!
