Hey, <var>! What's up?
I came to play with you!
I'm here for a battle!
All right, let's do it! Of course if two Trainers are going to play, it's gotta be a Pokémon battle, right? Yup, it's decided! I guess we should head to Lush Jungle. Let's make this like a little treasure hunt. Come find me where the Wimpod is! Don't be late!
Mallow! Can you give me a hand?
Huh? Where's Mallow?
In the jungle
She's not here
At this hour? That's not like her... but now I'm in a jam. I was going to ask her to go do some shopping for me.
If you see her, can you tell her something for me? Tell her to bring my Wimpod with her when she comes home.
Oh, you made it!
Wimpod is in my big brother's party.
Wi-wim!
It's out here gathering ingredients for our restaurant!
Wi-wim-wim!
You've got all the ingredients you need for a delicious battle, right?
Let's do this!
Gimme a minute...
Oh really? Well come back and tell me when you're ready!
Time for you to see that I can do more than just cook!
That battle was a piece of cake for you, wasn't it? I should've known—you did clear my trial, after all! As your captain, I am very proud of you, though!
The way that Mallow looked in that battle seems to linger in your mind...
There's no doubt in my mind that you'll go on to be an amazing Trainer! Like, you could even be a kahuna someday!

Do you ever think about the future, <var>?
I do
Nope
Oh, I see. Well, I've got my future all planned out! I mean, we have to move on from being captains when we turn 20 anyway. It may be ordinary, but I'm hoping to take over my family's restaurant. I think I could be an even better chef than my dad and big brother one day!
Huh? What's up? Is it something about my big brother?
He had a favor to ask...
He told me to tell you...
Sorry, <var>! I've gotta get back! Come on, Wimpod. You, too! Big brother's waiting for us!
Wi-wi-wi-wim!
It's been fun, <var>! See you later! Bye!
