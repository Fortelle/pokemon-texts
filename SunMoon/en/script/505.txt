We occasionally ask Professor Kukui to run a special class for our school. He's done a great deal of research into Pokémon moves, after all.
Pokémon moves have PP. Um. Power Points. If the PP for a move runs out, your Pokémon won't be able to use it anymore. Not till you get it restored, I mean. And you can just take it to a Pokémon Center for that!
Who do you think picks up all the Poké Balls you throw that don't catch any Pokémon?
I can read! Here, watch. "Moves have types, just like Pokémon... "If you use a move that's the same type as your Pokémon, it will get a special boost in power!"
Petting my Pokémon makes me happy, too!
There is writing on the blackboard. It describes how types match up. Grass is weak to Fire. Water is weak to Grass. Fire is weak to Water. There are many more types, too, and they have their own weaknesses, just like these three.
Healing Your Pokémon When your Pokémon are injured or suffering from some status condition, either get them to a Pokémon Center or use the appropriate medicines on them!
