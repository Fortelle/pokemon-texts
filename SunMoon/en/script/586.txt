I'm afraid we've got no vacancies today.
Especially not with that room two doors down being rented out nonstop all this time.
The boy staying there paid up two YEARS worth of nights when he first got here. Though he's not so free with cash now as he used to be... Seems like Team Skull doesn't pay well enough to live off of.
I'm afraid we've got no vacancies today. The boy who had been renting out the room two doors down finally did move out, though. Found this odd thing when I was cleaning out.
Mother— I apologize most sincerely for the actions I took in taking Null and running away. Yet I cannot regret these actions. They were for the sake of the greater good. So, until we meet again...
I had thought that if you knew the boy you might be able to take that letter to him, but now I'm thinking I'll hold it for him till he comes to get it himself.
He's a terrible "guard" Pokémon, but my Snubbull is still super cute!
Grrr brrr!
