Ledges make for one-way trips! Jump over one and you're there in a flash— but there's no quick way back from that trip!
The Pokémon I've got with me are all Grass type. I'm looking for some Water-type Pokémon for my team so I can beat Fire types, too.




Hey, you! You look like you're having a good time strolling around Alola. You make me want to dash around, too! And I bet I can go even faster than you! Holding [0xE001] will make me a B-Dasher! And it makes me look pretty dashing, too!




Wa ha ha! You're a strong Trainer, all right! Go on! You take on Ten Carat Hill, friend! Even stronger Pokémon await you within!
