Excuse me, Mr. Faba...
Yes, excuse you! What is the meaning of that form of address? I have a title for a reason! How else will anyone know how important I am?
Yes... Branch Manager Faba...
Now, I must go speak with the president about our conservation efforts on Akala... Show these children around, and then take them to meet the president as well.
Phew...
Welcome to Aether Paradise, <var> and Hau. My name is Wicke.
Nice to meet you
Alola!
Wait? You know who we are? How'd you know that?!
One of our employees told me about your meeting on Akala Island. And of course I heard how you helped protect the Pok√©mon there, too, young Mr. Hau. Thank you very much!
Let me show you around. The main entrance is up above us.
Shall we zip right up there?
