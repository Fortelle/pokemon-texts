There are all kinds of art collections lined up, filled with paintings by the artist Mina.
The floor is covered with art supplies!
That daughter of ours stuffs her cheeks with as much food as she can fit in there and then she disappears off somewhere to paint. She's like some fey vagabond, I swear.
It was this Snubbull here that first set our girl down the path to becoming a serious artist. When she showed Snubbull a picture she'd drawn of it, this little fellow chewed that drawing to shreds in its delight! But Mina misunderstood and thought that Snubbull had torn it up because it was bad...
Buuu...
