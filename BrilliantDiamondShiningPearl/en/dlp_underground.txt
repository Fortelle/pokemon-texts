Good morning!
Good afternoon!
Good evening!
The Grand Underground is really massive!You should keep your eye on the map as you go so you don't get lost.
The true thrills of being underground are digging for Fossils and meeting Pokémon!I completely lose track of time when I'm down here.
The Underground is divided into separate zones.If you want to go to a different zone, you should go up to the surface first!
Have you found a Pokémon Hideaway yet?There are lots of Pokémon there,so keep looking!
Some Pokémon Hideaways are small, while others are much larger.In the larger ones, you're more likely to see bigger Pokémon!
Try giving spheres to the folks standing around the Underground—they might trade you something nice!You may even find someone that'll heal your Pokémon for you!
I made a Secret Base all for myself!You can bore a hole in a wall with the Digger Drill to build your own.
You can place statues in your Secret Base.Apparently something good will happen if you place lots of them.
Have you ever visited someone else's Secret Base?It's fun to look and see how differently people arrange them.
You can set pedestals for the statues you place in your Secret Base.If you've got a pedestal, go ahead and try it.
There are all sorts of things buried in the walls of the Underground.Sometimes you'll even find treasure!
You can usually tell which walls you can dig into by looking at the map.And don't forget to check your radar when you're near a digging point!
When you're digging for Fossils, watch out for cracks in the wall!If you dig too much, the wall will collapse.
You can dig into walls using a sledgehammer or a pickax.Each tool affects a differently sized area, so you should use the one that's best for the situation!
When you're digging for Fossils, you'll find some rocks that you can't break.If you come across those, you should find somewhere else to dig.
Sometimes when you're digging in the walls,you'll find a Mysterious Shard.What do you suppose they're used for?
Have you ever dug up a stone box? There are statues inside of those!
There are a few different types of stone boxes.The prettier the box, the rarer the statue you'll find inside.
It's a good idea to collect lots of spheres.You can exchange them for all sorts of things with some folks in the Underground.
Spheres come in large and small sizes.The larger spheres are rare, so you're lucky if you find one!
Oh! <var>! I'm so glad you're awake!I helped out your Pokémon, and <var> doing fine now.
Oh! <var>! Are you OK?!
Your Secret Base was too far away, so I dragged you here for now.
It would be nice if you had a place where you could rest and relax down here in the Grand Underground.
The Pokémon down here in the Grand Underground are extremely tough!Be careful while you're exploring!Anyway, see you later!
