Here I come!
Yeah!
Bleah!
Hey, rookie! Bring it on!
Yeah, I knew it. You're a rookie after all.
Bleah! You're just a rookie!
I gotta say it—shorts are the best! They remain comfy and easy to wear!
Shorts are the greatest!
I'll never stop wearing shorts. Not for anybody!
I make it a policy to wear miniskirts!
Miniskirts are the ultimate!
What's your policy?
I love my miniskirt!
Caught you snoozing!
Miniskirts make legs look longer! Is that a good thing?
I'm on the lookout for adorable clothes.
Let me know if you find anything nice!
I wish I could dress up!
I want to test out something I learned at private school.
Yes! It worked perfectly!
Hmm... Something's wrong here.
Uh... Wroar!
A battle is about momentum and willpower.
OK, so willpower doesn't cut it on its own.
I study every day because I want to work all over the world.
My dream is worldwide!
I need to study up on Pokémon battles.
When I grow up, I'm going to be a Pokémon Professor!
Er-hem! Er-hem! You've much to learn, youngster!
Er-hem! Er-hem! Seems I've much to learn still!
When the subject is Pokémon, I simply don't lose!
It's a victory of knowledge!
I'm going to review the subject—and I'll subject you to my revenge!
Oh, now you look wimpy. I might win this.
I so did it!
Ouch, that hurt.
It's fine, fine. No need to say a word.
It's fine, fine. You tried your best, I know.
It's fine, fine... No need to say a word...
I'm rich!
Well, of course. I'm rich.
What happened? I'm rich, aren't I?
Hmm. So, you're good, huh?
Hmm. You're no big deal. Hmm?
Hmm. So, you are good. Hmm.
Oh, yes. I shall attack now.
I've done it!
Oh, how disappointing.
Your adventure is over. Come hither and get whupped!
A done deal, it was.
Oh, how vexing this is. Verily, I thank you.
How boring...
So truly boring...
That was a good way to waste some time.
Huh? Where is everyone?
Hey, guys! Where are you?!
I came to camp, but I think I got separated from my friends...
Oh! You have a Pokétch too?
I was fooling around with my Pokétch,but I still won!
I was fooling around with my Pokétch,and I lost...
My Pokémon trained in the forest.
It's the power of the forest.
I'm going back to the forest.
I'll battle you like I'm on a picnic!
Lalala!
Pretending this is a picnic won't let me win.
Ooh la la! Here we come!
Ooh la la! So happy I won!
Ooh la la! Even losing can't dampen my spirits!
I'll teach you what's fun about battling.
Battling me was fun, wasn't it?
Oh my, that was inspiring! You're the greatest!
I—I can swim, really! I don't need my inner tube!
It—It's true!
I—I'm not lying!
I like rivers more than the sea. Which do you prefer?
River water is cold, but it feels just super.
I don't like the sea because the salt water burns my eyes!
Go, go, go! Go, my Pokémon!
That's the way! Way to go, my Pokémon!
Good effort! Way to go, my Pokémon!
The beach sand is so hot! It makes me go,"Ouch, ouch, ouch!"
I love the sea!
Ouch, ouch, ouch!
Splish, splash!
Ker-splash! Ker-splash!
Flip, flop!
I'm a girl in love with her inner tube!Nice to meet you!
Thank you! I'm a girl in love with her inner tube!
Good-bye! I'm a girl in love with her inner tube!
Oh yeah, I'm feeling it! I'm tuned in to your wavelength!
Tadaaaah!
Tch! Losing threw off my rhythm!
Rock? Jazz? Techno?Anything'll do for my soundtrack!
*squeeeeeal*
So, yeah... You've got me in the mood for singing the blues...
Let's get this jam session on!
You're obviously short on practice.
My dream of a world tour... It seems so far away...
Oh, hello... Well, aren't you chic?
How about recommending me a shop?
Oh, you! You're not just fashionable, you're good with Pokémon too! How unfair!
Thanks for supporting me!
Oh? You're not my fan?
What a horrible way to treat an idol...
La, lala, lah.
La lalala. Lalalah lah.
Bye-bye, lalah!
Let's see who loves Pokémon more, you or me.
Fuhaha! Looks like my love for Pokémon trumped yours!
Grr... Your love of Pokémon is stronger than mine?
I tell ya, my Pokémon are some kind of tough.
You don't want to underestimate me.
You're some kind of mighty.
OK, show me your favorite Pokémon.Don't be shy now, come on.
I see... Cute, but on the weak side.
I see! Cute, and yet tough.
My Pokémon are cute, but they're not very tough!
Oh? We won? Seriously?
It's OK. I like my Pokémon. That's all that matters.
I've been pampering my gang too much lately.Can they do this?
Ooh, they did it! I knew I could count on my gang!
Pampering Pokémon too much is no good...
Won't you join our Pokémon Fan Club?
There're all sorts of fun things to do if you join!
Join us! Become a Poké Fan like me!
May I take your order, please?
Ah, a fine choice—one loss served fresh.
Ah, an excellent choice—a win served fresh.
What I really hoped to become was a cook.
I don't mind this job now, mind you.
I just find it hard talking to strangers.
For battles and order-taking, speed is essential!
Like, chop-chop! You got served.
Food is like battling. Serve it while it's hot!
My job is about serving others. But don't expect me to take orders here.
Mufufu.
Why couldn't you serve me? You won't make friends that way!
See my uniform? Isn't it cute?
It's my favorite!
You messed up my uniform!
You're good, aren't you?
Oops. I'm a little disappointed.
I knew you were a tough Trainer.
I catch and raise all sorts of Pokémon.
See? I've raised them pretty good.
I need to raise my Pokémon some more!
I'll snag you with my net!
It's in the bag!
Hey! Don't run away!
Where can I find a giant Heracross?
I want a huge Heracross—like, king-size!
If only I had a giant Heracross...
Prepare to lose!
The enemy is mine!
I lie shattered...
Behold my fearsome ninja technique!
Haha! You saw it!
You didn't fall for my fake ninja boasting!
I shall become a real ninja when I grow up!
Excellent! Excellent!
So, what's a real ninja supposed to do?
Should I torment you?
Yay! Yay!
No! No tormenting me!
My mommy made this outfit for me.
Isn't it cute?
My mommy is really good at sewing.
Let's do our best, everyone!
Thanks, everyone!
Waaaaah!
Sure, we're going to battle, but don't be over the top about it.
Hey, relax, relax. It's best to be natural, yeah?
You have to loosen up some more.
Fish, fish, fish, that's what I do! I'm gonna fish it all up!
Kahaha! I am at the top of my game!
Oh, waaah! I let that one get away!
Exploring ruins isn't all fun and games!
Your skill level says you probably wouldn't make a good Ruin Maniac.
Danger lurks everywhere in ruins!
These mates of mine traveled the world with me!
What do you say? Pretty tough, right?
Maybe it's time we hit the road again...
Hey there! Check out my rare Pokémon!
My Pokémon aren't just rare, either.They're tough, too!
Whoa! Hey! Wait! No! Stop! Don't touch!
Now just be patient. I'll show you my private collection!
See, see? Weren't they awesome?They're the most super of the über!
Awawawah... M—My Pokémon...
Look! This is my favorite parasol—oh, and my fabulous Pokémon!
Aren't they both cute?
I'm only showing you! You can't have any!
Have you ever seen a rainbow?
Have you wondered what lies beyond a rainbow?
Seeing a rainbow makes me think good things are in store.
If you were the weather, what would you be now?
Right now, I'm feeling sunny without a cloud in the sky!
I'm feeling fogbound...
I really don't like weak Trainers!
You don't inspire much trust...
A Pokémon Trainer should be tough and bursting with life!
Lately, I've had a lot to worry about...
Winning makes all my worries seem trivial!
You just added to my worries...
This may hurt a little bit, but we'll be done quick.Hold still!
There! Done!
Ooh, no! That hurts!
*sniff* *sniffle*
*sniffle* *snuffle*I think I have a cold...
*sniff* *sniffle*My nose is clogging up...
*sniff*
Now what could this aroma be?
Are you wearing a fragrance? You smell sort of nice!
You're going to lose, but you'll get to enjoy a nice aroma!
Kyahaha! That's what you get for swooning to my aroma!
Argh! I am so angry!
Let my guitar howl! Hear me scream!
Yeahey!
Giyaaaah!
You should channel your feelings into songs with sincerity.
The way I feel now? It's rock 'n' roll!
The way I feel now is kind of folksy.
Now hear me—I'll tell you the Bird Keeper's number one motto!
Soar high on a win!
Rest your wings on a loss!
Let's both do our best!
Yup, we both did the best we could!
Good going!
Fly, fly, fly! We're going to rule this battle!
*zoooooom*
We're gonna crash!
I'm the sailor among sailors! I was born on the high seas!
The waves rocked me to sleep! The sea was my mother!
Urp... Gweh... So, when I get up on land,I get no-motion sickness...
The sea, my beautiful sea!
Oh... I hear them... I hear the sound of waves...
I want to become a big man. Big like the sea big.
Yahoo!
Come on! You holler too!
Gweff! Hack! Hack! Hollering choked me up!
You should aspire to the hiker's way of life!
You see? You love my lifestyle, don't you?
Come on, now! You should look up to the way I live!
My Pokémon and I are idols!
Say what you will! We're idols!
We have you beat when it comes down to popularity...
Watch me! All eyes on me!
Ooh... This is what I live for...
I became an idol because I wanted everyone to see me!
I'm too into battling... They might fire me from my job as an idol...
Battling is too much fun!
I can't help myself. No one can keep me from battling.
I run a marathon every morning. It's great!
My buff physique makes for easy wins!
So I lost. I can still run great marathons!
I'll run in place while battling for the good of my health.
Let's hear it for good health!
*gasp*My ankle! I rolled my ankle!
Out of the way! I've got deliveries to make!
What? You want me to deliver you somewhere, too?
All the delivering I do every day...I've got deep muscle pain!
It was me who put up the buildings around these parts.
So, what do you think? Cool stuff, huh?
My dream is to make a building taller than a mountain!
Smell that? That's the smell of hay clinging to my body.
Whoa!
This smell I have is the sweet scent of hay that Pokémon surely love.
All right, take a run at me! My barrel chest can take it!
What, that's all you've got? You can take a harder run at me!
Ooh... Ow... That hurt... It's like you broke my barrel chest...
I'm not getting any younger. I can't overexert myself.
What I lack in youth, I make up for in experience.
Oh, you're good and young. There's a sparkle about you.
Hey! You there, Trainer! You and me,we're battling!
Owned!
Unbelievable!
These here are my Pokémon. I raised them with my ma and pa.
Sure right kind of tough, aren't they?
Well, I'll be! We lost that one!
I'm going to do my level best. You'd better keep up!
Whew! We sure did our best!
Yup! We tried hard, y'all!
OK, everyone! Big smiles!
Big smiles! Come on!
That's a great smile! Your victory pose is picture-perfect, too!
Zoom in on you!
Spot-on focus!
Zoom out, fade...
This camera is pretty hefty, actually.
My shoulder is always rock-hard...My camera's toughened me up.
Oof... I'm feeling groggy...
Hello there, Trainer! Please battle with me!
Thanks for your help!
I appreciate the lesson!
I'll do anything for a good news story!
I'm relentless about battling, too!
Stop! Please, stop! You'll break my mic!
So, the question is, what is your opinion of me?
"What a tough Trainer!" Is that what you're thinking?
I'm doing a live report on the topic of myself!
Come on! We'll ride—together!
I beat you!
Wait! Don't leave me behind!
Gear change! We're attacking at top speed!
*vrooooom*
*kaboom*
Can you keep up with my Pokémon at full speed?
Too slow!
I'm taking it to a zone beyond speed!
I'd rather cycle casually than go full speed.
Let's take it easy.
You ought to take things more casually...
I only know how to go at full power,even against a younger opponent!
Full power is how I win!
Please! Let me call you Master Trainer from now on!
My spirit burns, my fists are steel, and my sweat cascades!
Hrrumph!
I sweated more. That makes me the victor!
En garde!
I'm still ready for more.
Urgh... I won't forget this!
Hey! Come on!
Nice fight!
You're not bad, you.
Experience my ultimate technique in its entirety!
I am the greatest! Gwahahaha!
I've fallen in defeat? Gw-gwaaah!
Hi, little kid! A battle, please!
Little kid! Thank you very kindly!
Little kid! I'm really upset over this!
I, um... I've never actually learned how to do karate.
You're kidding! I'm naturally talented?!
Black belts are cool, so I just dress up like one.
It's been five years since I took to the mountains.My hair's grown wild!
I bathe every day! How dare you?
Another five years...?
Did I catch you smirking at my eight-pack abs?
You don't appreciate the beauty of pure muscles!
Musculature is the ultimate beauty!
In love and in battles, I've never tasted defeat!
See? We won again!
So, I lost. I don't care! I have a date soon,so I don't care!
This is it! Over the top! Everyone charge!
The enemy Trainer has fallen! Victory is ours!
Retreat! Sound the retreat!
My career as a Trainer dates back 75 years.You think you can win?
Here's a toast to my history!
My history of glory...
Are you prepared?
Ah, what a superb battle that was.
I tip my hat to you.
Oh, my... Such an adorable Trainer...
Are we disappointed? How adorable...
I see... You're more than simply adorable.
Eee-yeah!
A stirring shout, wouldn't you say?I find it quite bracing.
*gasp*Oh dear... I'm worn out.
Being rich doesn't shield me from having worries.
Of course, being well off is much preferable to poverty, but still...
Lavish parties day after day... It gets rather tiresome, I must say.
Come to know defeat... Learn what it means to battle...
I see you becoming ever more powerful...
The defeated merely slink away...
Look into my eyes!
You fell under my spell!
My power of suggestion failed to charm you!
...
Did it.
I focused my mind in silence...
My powers—there's no trickery about them!
This is psychic power!
There really is no trickery...
Take it all!
Ahaha!
Gah!
Close your eyes and count... Slow... Slower...
That was the countdown to my victory!
Tch... I thought I could lull you to sleep.
I live among Pokémon.
I've never been much of a battler, but...
I'm just not much of a battler.
They're Pokémon I've raised with my father...
Dad, are you seeing this? I did it...
Dad, I can't... I need to raise them some more...
Raising Pokémon takes a lot of honest effort!
Yahaha! I've had a hands-on time raising those Pokémon!
Urgwah! Look what you've done to my Pokémon!
Will you have a look at the Pokémon I've raised?
Well? Cute, aren't they?
Cut a girl some slack!
I specialize in raising cute Pokémon!
Cute, yet strong! Right?
Oh, but they're so cute!
Nice to meet you! Underestimate me at your peril!
Told you!
I guess I underestimated you...
Ahaha... I must say, I like the look in your eyes.
Your eyes remain unclouded in defeat.Like jewels, they are!
Your eyes shine brighter than any gemstone I keep at home!
When I was your age, I was quite the daredevil,I must say.
Seeing you reminds me of my own wild youth.
I daresay you're quite the daredevil yourself!
If you want to run home to Mommy, here's your chance, punk!
Geheheh!
Waaah! I want my mommy!
Battles achieve nothing! Take my hand—it's about love!
I didn't mean to battle—but take my hand!It's about love!
Battling is futile! Take my hand—it's about love!
I dropped my glasses. I can't see straight.
I guess I won. I can't see enough to tell.
I guess I lost. I can't see enough to tell.
Slow and steady. You build from the little things up.
Slow and steady is how I won!
But I did things slow and steady...
Hehehehe...
Gehahahaha!
*sob*
Everybody gather around for my stupendicular Pokémon show!
Wasn't that amusing?
Nrrgh... I am not amused.
I shall train with you.
Show some spine! On your feet!
Fine! That will do!
Why get all intellectual about things? If it's fun,why question it?
See, I can still win. I don't see a problem!
So I lost. If it's fun, it's cool!
I expect you to be good... Don't you disappoint me!
My hope was misplaced...
You've got a good thing going.
My papa and mama are skilled Trainers, too.
It's in my lineage!
Papa, Mama! I'm so sorry!
I go all out in battle, no matter what.
The inevitable conclusion!
I concede!
This is it—the biggest battle in my life!I cannot afford to lose!
Woot, yeah!
This sets me back to being a lass...
My love of nature and Pokémon made a Ranger out of me!
I love to battle, too!
Ooh... I still love to battle, too.
Hi! Have you ever considered a career as a Pokémon Ranger?
Well, you might not make it at your skill level.
Yes, you've got the mettle. Being a Pokémon Ranger is a lot of fun!
Win or lose, a battle happens only once!
Do you have any regrets?
I have no regrets!
It's my sworn duty to protect nature and the Pokémon in it.
It's a challenging life, but there's a lot to enjoy every day.
It's a rewarding career. How does it sound to you?
My darling Pokémon will lay a licking on you!
Well? Satisfied?
Well, aren't you tough? I'm a little stunned!
I didn't sleep while trying to come up with this new strategy!
My strategy worked!
Oh... But I really needed to sleep last night...
The credo of the Dragon Tamer—number one!
In victory, roar! Roar with your dragon!
Even in defeat, roar! Roar with your dragon!
Mighty! Like a dragon!
Strong, I am!
*urf*I wanted to be strong...
See it! Feel it! The ultimate power...probably.
There is no defeat for me, the ultimate...probably...
The title of the ultimate...probably... I confer it on you!
Oh, wow! Rare Pokémon!
Heheheh... That's what you get for letting down your guard.
Tch. Couldn't fool you.
I can't stand getting cold, but I'm quite good.
*ch-chatter*Wa-wahaha. I won, I won!
*ch-chatter*Urr... I'm getting sleepy...
My ace Pokémon are on the go!
You surprise me! Not too shabby!
I like the sense you show!
Snow is wonderful! Everything becomes white.
Snow is so romantic!
I'm whiting out...
Don't you think this coat is cute? It limits my movements, though.
It's toasty warm.
I feel snowed under...
I'm the one! Number one out of all the kids in shorts!
See? That's what being number one is about!
Darn... I'm number one...
I'm the one! The only one true one among shorts-wearing kids!
See? That's what being the only one is about!
Darn... I'm the only one...
Um... I'm pleased to meet you.
Awawa... We won?Um? S-sorry.
Er, um... Th-thank you...
Here goes!
Bravo!
*yelp*
You will also learn!
The harsh realities of battling!
The joy of victory!
Allow me to study you.
You offered me nothing new to learn.
I get it now. In that situation, I should have used that move.
My teacher gave me advice on battling.
My teacher was right! That was just so easy!
Aww, my teacher was wrong! None of it worked!
Why are we battling? I don't get it.
Why? I don't understand.
Why did you win? What happens now?
Ultimately, Pokémon is just another brand.You know who'll win, right?
I'm not interested in what was an inevitable result.
But how... My... The Pokémon I've raised...
There isn't anything that I can't buy.Money can even buy victory!
There's nothing that money can't buy.
I'll give you my allowance if you'll let me win.
You know, I'm really not cut out for this socialite-lady thing...
Gahahahah!
You swine! Now I'm steamed!
I'll be done with you lickety-split!
Lickety-split is how you were done!
Lickety-split is how I'll excuse myself!
*crunch**crunch*
I love these crunchy Lava Cookies...
So itchy!
The way of the Bug Catcher! Bear witness to it!
This is the way of the Bug Catcher!
All hail Bug Catchers!
Feast your eyes on the secret techniques of the ancient ones!
See? What did you think? Are you awestruck?
That's my cue to disappear in a puff of smoke.
I see it!
Think not ill of me...
Gyoeeeh!
Pikaaa!
Pikapikaaah!
Pika pi...
A battle, you say? I'm never losing to you!
Yeehaw! Yippee! I won, I won!
Urk... We lost...
It's my job to be cute!
Just being cute is money in the bank!
Ugagaah! You rotten thief!
You can shake hands with me! It would be quite the honor for you!
If you'd won, I would have even given you my autograph!
My management team will have something to say about this!
Run! Don't think! Run!
Faster! More! More! Faster!
Run! Keep running for me!
Hiya. Nice to meet ya.
All right. Nice seeing ya.
All right. Thanks for coming by.
My cohorts call me the emperor of fishing!
I landed another big one today!
Why the emperor of fishing? It's an ancient legend...
When you get as good as me, you can win easily,even if asleep.
*zzz*
*sssnore*
My mom and I travel around in search of lost treasures.
The rest of the time, we fish and tend to crops.
You sure seem to be hectic.
Win! That's what I'll do again today!I'll win tomorrow, too!
Nahaha! Nahaha!I'm not gonna lose for my whole life!
Nooooo! No way! I didn't lose!
Allow me to examine your prowess as a collector.
You're still wanting. I urge you to keep at it.
That's quite the collection. I'm willing to relieve you of the lot.
Yah, yah, yah!
Yesss!
Owowowoooh!
I want you to hear it! A shout from the heart!
I love music!
Let's hear it for an encore!
Battle? I'm up for that.
Wow. Good stuff.
Thanks much.
Fwoom!
Flap! Flap!
I'm gonna pluck you for that!
Sure, let's duke it out!
Let's battle again!
You're not half bad!
Looking out over the sea's breaking waves...It revives memories.
Wroaaaaaar! Daddy!
Wroaaaar! Mommy!
Come on! Take a run at me! I can take it!
So, what'd you think? Was I too burly for you to handle?
Good job! Way to overcome my size!
Waah! Wait! Wait a second!My mind's not into this yet!
Huh? It's over already? What? I won, you say?
Huh? It's over already? What? I lost, you say?
My favorite drink is Moomoo Milk. Got some?
Wahaha! I get the win! Let's celebrate over some Moomoo Milk!
Gwaah! Moomoo Milk! Bring me some Moomoo Milk!
Stop right there!
Hah! I've still got it.
I can't believe I let myself down like that!
I'm a uniform collector.
You look like a uniform would suit you.You should try to find one you like.
I must say, battling is a wonderful thing.
Who knows what happens tomorrow?
You can lose one day, and win the next.That's how it goes.
I might win tomorrow. That's what I believe.
I'm throwing my all into this match!
Yeah! Yahoo!
It's over!
The indefatigable camper makes his stand!
You can become a devotee if you'd like.
I wish I could become your devotee.
I don't think I have any chance of winning,but sure, I'll battle.
Wow, I wasn't expecting to win.
I knew I'd lose. I'm so sorry for this.
You're awfully interested in me, aren't you?
You lost because you were paying too much attention to me.
Why did you win? I thought you liked me.
Win or lose, let's not bear any grudges.
Yay, yay, yay! We did it!
Oh, you! Don't ever forget this!
Pokémon are for grown-ups, too.Let me show you...
What do you think? Am I deep like an old blues man?
Even though that wasn't fun, I can handle it in a mature way.
What I have here isn't really a guitar.
*beep* *boop* *bzzt*
This here is a keyboard synth.
For work, I sometimes get to be a swimmer or a beauty.
An idol can become anybody!
But the real me... I'm still a lass in a miniskirt!
Let's enjoy ourselves. I hate anything to do with pain!
Ooh! That was fun!
Yowch! Watch it! You play too rough!
I'll put an end to this—with my favorite Pokémon!
The love I have for my Pokémon is complete and perfectly strong...
Why? Why?! Why did I lose?!
Living with Pokémon... Every day is the greatest.
Ehehe... Pokémon are the best.
It's not a problem if I lose. I still have my Pokémon...
I have my Pokémon. I don't need anything else.
With my Pokémon, I can be happy every day.
Isn't that the same for you? Isn't it?
You wouldn't guess it now, but I was the life of the party in my day.
Well, I still have it now, you know.
I feel nostalgic for those days...
Do your best, my beloved children!
Wahaha! Well done! Papa's proud of you!
My Pokémon are my beloved family.
Little boy? Little girl? Doesn't matter which.Let's do this!
Little boy? Little girl? Doesn't matter which,but I'm sorry.
Little boy? Little girl? Doesn't matter which,but you're sure tough!
Your ride ends here.
Told ya it's over.
Too much for me to handle!
We're going for the win! Hey-ho, let's go!
Yay! Vavavoom!
Aww, we lost...*sniffle*
Let me introduce you to my cherished partners!
My cherished partners! How did you find them?
Awawa... My partners...
Winning and losing isn't all there is to battling.
Well, sure, it makes me happy when I win.
The effort you put in is what's important.
It's no good to be too harsh... But pampering is also out.
Being a Pokémon Breeder is a deep and complex challenge.
Balance is key for raising good Pokémon.
I'll check how your Pokémon have grown for you.
Not good enough! Your training style's not up to par.
This is impressive! You've raised your Pokémon really thoroughly.
I'll win. No lie.
See?
Huh!
Fwaah! Fwaah! You think you can beat me?
Fwaah! Fwaah! I win!
Fwaah!
I've caught you now. Give up.
You weren't bad. Let's meet again.
How could this be?
Yo, yo! Let's have a fun time!
Thank you! Let's play again!
Thanks! Play with me again!
You're no good at all. I'd better teach you.
No, no, this won't do at all. Up on your feet.Never give up!
You've got good skills. You tried hard, too.Excellent!
I'm jacking up the power to max! All the way to 11!
Ooh, yeah! I'm feeling electric!
Eeyow! I got zapped!
OK, bring it!
Hah! Too weak! Keep trying!
Hoh! You are tough! Give me a rematch!
You need to be serious with me!
Oh? That's it?
OK... Quite remarkable.
Ahaha! Too bad for you! I'm your opponent!
Ahaha!
Aha... Ahaha...
Are you nervous? Leave it to the dude!
That was a good battle. I hope we can meet again.
Whew... The dude wasn't expecting to lose.
The power of nature! Let me show you!
This is the power of nature!
Protect the natural environment...
A battle with me? I don't know what you're talking about.
See? I thought this would happen.
Boo! Boo! This is not right!
Fuhahaha! Your next challenge is me!
Fuhahaha! You seriously believed you could defeat me?
Fuhahaha! Let us meet again!
Off you go! Face my team of totally trained Pokémon!
Bravo! I knew my Pokémon would do it!
Oh, no! That's awful! What have you done to my Pokémon?!
A battle is deadly earnest! We can afford not a moment of inattention!
Never let down your guard!
I seem to have let my mind wander...
Hey!
Heeey!
Hey...
I'm tough, that's all.
I won, that's all.
I lost, that's all.
Shaah!
Hwooh!
Hawah!
I've been here for years, but I never get tired of this.
You might not think so, but I'm still a kid. I'm in the same grade as you.
I'd like to keep battling with Pokémon even when my hair is gray.
Let me make one thing clear... You aren't capable of beating me.
Did I not say? There is no possible chance of you beating me.
How could this be? Only that girl with the inner tube has beaten me...
Oh, my, a mere child.
Children these days... So careless.
Children these days... Quite exuberant, methinks.
I would like my children to become strong and distinguished Trainers.
It wouldn't do if my children were only as good as you...
It would be nice if they were as skilled as you...
Behold, you shall! Mystifying psychic power!
You see? Mystifying psychic power!
No, but... Mystifying psychic power!
My family will show you a good time!
Hold up, my family! That'll be enough already!
My beloved family...
Twirl, twirl, twirl...
Are you feeling dizzy?
Ooorgh... My head's spinning!
My big brother told me... Eyes! Aim for the eyes!
Yay! I did it! My big brother's plan worked!
My big brother told me to lower the foe's accuracy!
Hoy! You look pretty tough. This is gonna be fun!
I thought so! You are tough!
Yup, you sure are tough. Keep it up!
Ah, welcome! I'm your server today!
Would you care to settle your bill?
Thank you so much!
Hello. Whatcha having?
Thanks a million!
Be seeing ya!
I love cute customers like you! I'll serve you right!
Well, were you happy with the way I served you?
Oh, but... I'm not done serving you.
*stare*
You've got something on your nose.
You're cool, all right. I had to stare.
I've waited a long time for a Trainer like you to come along.
Yup, you're as tough as I thought. You even had me in trouble!
I knew it! You are a tough Trainer!
Now, how should I conduct this offensive?
Oh, now, I need a better effort out of you than that.
Oh, you're finished and content? OK, another time then.
My Pokémon have a different taste from the usual bunch.
Did you notice the difference? My party has rich depth.
Did you notice the difference? My party is refreshingly dry.
Hiya! Tough-looking Trainer, aren't you!
This feeling of elation is bubbling up in me!
Ooch... You're too much to handle.
Varrroooom! Watch me go full throttle!
Varrroooom! I'm not close to redlining!
Vrrr... Vrruuu... I'm flat out of gas.
*jingle jingle*
*skreeeech*
*thud*
It's my dream to cycle with my boyfriend.
No riding double, though!
I wish I had a boyfriend!
What's your motive? What brought you here?
You lose. Now what will you do?
Play it again.
Let's keep this match fair and simple.
I admire your technique.
I remain humbled...
You're serious? A battle? Against me?
*cackle*You shouldn't have tried!
Double wow!
I'll dance and sing and rivet your attention!
Ooh, baby!
So much for riveting your attention. My Pokémon didn't stand a chance!
Ready, start!
First across the finish line!
Waah! Wait for me!
Can you explain why I'm here?
I mean, who are you?
Why am I battling here?
My fishing-rod-handling technique is the best in all Sinnoh. Check it out!
See it? Surprised, I bet!
How I handle my fishing rod has nothing to do with battling...
The two loves of my life are fishing and battling.
I feel fantastic when I land a big fish or win a big battle.
I was born to fish and battle!
I came here on a ship. Big ship it was.
Sinnoh, I like. Very nice place.
You want to go to sea? In my ship, we will see wonderful things.
Huh? You're my opponent? This is kind of unnerving...
I'm surprised... I didn't think I'd win.
See, I told you... I thought you were tough.
Hahah! Howdy!
Hahah! Keep it coming!
Thanks for your time!
Let's be good sports about this! Big smile!
Ahaha! Ahaha! Come on, you laugh, too!
I'm cheerful even in defeat! Ahaha! Ahaha!
Buck up.
Not bad.
You're good.
The sweetest thing about battling?The finishing blow!
Take that! That's my finishing move!
Oof... I felt your finishing shot.
Hey, you're looking nifty!
Hey, you tried, right?
Hey, you're kind of tough.
Listen! This is my chorus group. Me and my Pokémon!
Shooby-dooby doowop!
Oh, wait! We're not done singing!
I got tips from my online friends on how to best raise my gang.
I must thank my online friends. I don't know who they are, though.
This is no good! My online buddies let me down!
Can I have a moment? I'm trying to write an email.
I need to get home quick and check my email.
What do you think you're doing? I want to go back to my email.
Father... Mother... Please watch over me.
Father... Mother... Were you watching?
Father... Mother... Please forgive me.
Can't rightly say I much like battling, I tell you.
I won, but...I'm still shaking.
Grr... I'm so angry I could cry.
It's the power of science!
Did you see? Were you amazed?That's the power of science!
It's inconceivable... How could the power of science be defeated?
Charge, my Pokémon! Demonstrate the fruits of our experimentation!
Yes, my Pokémon proved my theory! I'll get my professorship now!
What kind of experiments? That's classified.
I shall regress to my childhood for this battle.
Goo-goo ga-ga.
Ga-ga...
Fwahahaha! You've come a long way!
Fwahahahaha!
Fwahahaha! You're blessed to have your friends!
I'll scrap you.
I'll recycle you.
Think ecology. Think green.
Why, sure! Sounds great! We have to do this!
Bam! All done!
A battle while working... It's a good way to take a break.
I'll try to do my best! Please give me this chance!
I've done it! I've achieved my goal!
I tried the best I could! Thank you for your encouragement!
A battle is... It is a love letter written in sand.
Did you understand what I'm trying to say?I guess you wouldn't...
Did you understand what I'm trying to say?I guess you wouldn't...
Hello, you there! Yes, you! Wait up a second, eh?
OK, kids shouldn't be out at this time. Go on home now, you hear?
That's quite a Pokémon you have there!
*sssnork* *zzz*
Clefairy... *mumble*Wait for me... *sssnork*
*mutter*Ehehe... *ssssnore*
Let's keep this elegant!
Mmm, yes!
You're quite the Trainer yourself!
A battle isn't something you can calculate.
What'd I tell you? You win when you win.
What'd I say, huh? You lose when you lose.
There's lots in life that doesn't go the way you want.
Yippee! Things went my way!
See?
There's nowhere to run or hide!
This was a foregone conclusion!
Farewell!
I wait for tough Trainers here, come rain or shine.
Because of that, I've grown so very strong...
Won't a tough Trainer—No, forget that. I need a cool Trainer to come...
This is for keeping the sun off.
I'm strong at battling, but I can't take sunlight.
I don't want to roast my skin.
My, aren't you an unusual Pokémon?
Hmm, for some reason, I couldn't catch you.Such an odd Pokémon...
Oh, you're a Trainer? You're not a Pokémon?
Ready?
Cool.
Bye.
Beat me? Try again in another 10 years!
No spine!
You're tough! You inspire me!
Smelling sweet scents makes me so drowsy...
*yawn*Oh? Are we finished so soon?
*yawn*Oh, really? I lost?
You're sure you can handle me? I'm an ultrastellar talent.
Don't feel bad! I'm an ultrastellar talent!
You're in the miracle-star class!
I live only for battles. Only victories give me hope.
Naturally.
Who are you?
Now, come! Show me, the Tower Tycoon, what you're really made of!
A magnificent bout that was! Do come visit again!
Losing to an outstanding Trainer like you...I can live with that.
Now, come! Show me, the Tower Tycoon, what you're really made of!
A magnificent bout that was! Do come visit again!
Losing to an outstanding Trainer like you...I can live with that.
Don't get cocky, kid! This isn't over yet!
My Pokémon's HP is low... This could be a bit tight.
What just happened? I lost?!
Think you can take down the next Pokémon like you did the other ones?
No way! Not yet! Not giving up!
Wh-what? That can't be! My buffed-up Pokémon!
You avoided the long way around? Let's see why you'd do that!
Now I understand why you decided to battle with me.
You should go whichever way you want—take the shortcut or the long way!
Only those who want to win can challenge a Pokémon Gym!
Gggh... This is humiliating!
One day, I'm going to become a tough Trainer like you.
You're a Pokémon Trainer! I happen to be a Pokémon Trainer!Our eyes met, so battle we must!
Too strong! Too strong!
Don't be shy about talking to Trainers you'd like to battle. Pokémon grow stronger and stronger from battling.
Did you get better since we met? I... Well, here,just look!
Let's have a Pokémon battle!Humph! But I'm gonna win!
You're, like, wow!
It's fun to battle others! I'm gonna battle all sorts of people!
Let's have another Pokémon battle! This time,I'm gonna win!
I spy, with my little eye...a Trainer!A battle, please!
Oh, boo! I can't win!
My Pokémon are all tuckered out! I need to go to a Pokémon Center!
Oh, hi! I remember you, Trainer!A battle, please!
I'm full of energy because I get power from my Pokémon!
Oh! My poor Bidoof and Zubat!
Avoid tall grass... Or avoid Trainers...Do you have trouble deciding?
You look familiar, Trainer. Can I have another match?
We're always together. I'll show you how we've bonded!
It's got me down...
I don't bear grudges over losing. But I promise I'll get tougher!
I'm always with my Pokémon.Actually, you're always with your Pokémon too,aren't you?
Gimme a battle so I can see if I'm ready for the Pokémon Gym challenge!
I guess it means I'm not ready for the Gym challenge yet...
I guess if you don't have a single Gym Badge,you're a total nobody...
I'm about to take the Pokémon Gym challenge.But before I go, I wanna spar with you.
I got a nifty-keen Gym Badge from the Gym Leader in Oreburgh City!
Oh, I lost! Lalala!
I'm going to collect lots of Gym Badges! I'll work with my Pokémon!
I got a nifty-keen Gym Badge from the Gym Leader in Oreburgh City!...Did I show you already?
I found a Trainer while looking for some Pokémon!
Hunh? You're finished so soon?
I walk through tall grass until I find the Pokémon I want.
I found a familiar-looking Trainer!
Oh, a weak-looking Trainer... Do you want to have a go?
Aww... I shouldn't have battled in the first place.
I didn't know you were so tough... I'm going to train harder, too!
Hi, pretty-tough Trainer! Will you give me a rematch?
My dad gave me some Pokémon! They're gonna win for me!
But they're Pokémon I got from my dad...
Who gave you your first Pokémon?Your first Pokémon is the one with the most fond memories, I think.
I'm gonna win this time with the Pokémon I got from my dad!
May I please trouble you for a battle?
Oh... You're so strong...
Maybe I could have won if my Pokémon was holding a Berry.
Oh, thank you for that last battle.May I please trouble you for another one?
Say, what's your opinion on bug Pokémon?
I'm not going to be able to explain the charms of bug Pokémon this way!
Bug Pokémon grow quickly, and they do stuff like poison and paralyze, and they're cute and cool.You gotta believe me—they're good!
So, listen. Tell me you've grown to like bug Pokémon since we last met.
Let's have a battle while smelling the aroma of flowers!
Even though I lost, I'm not angry because it smells so nice.
Maybe my Pokémon will get scouted at the TV station in Jubilife City.
You came back to me because you couldn't forget the smell of flowers!
We can one-shot this Trainer, can't we, Liz?
Oh, oh, oh?
Aww! That is so bad!
You only have one Pokémon? That's so boring!
Oh! You're that Trainer! Let's get payback, Liz!
We're the strongest in our class!
Oh, but, wait!
I wish I could be strong like you when I get bigger.
Um, will you battle with us? Me and Liv?
We're the best in our class. We can't be losers all the time!
How about a quick battle before I leave for Eterna Forest?
That really dampened my spirits.
They say there are rough Pokémon in Eterna Forest.I'd better be more prepared than this.
You've been to Eterna Forest already, right?How was it?
It's a long way between Floaroma Town and Eterna City. So, let's battle!
Wawawaah! I'm out of Pokémon that can battle!
With my Pokémon by my side, I'm sure any camping will be a blast!
While I was enjoying camping, my Pokémon got all big and buffed up!
What kinds of Pokémon live around here,I wonder.
I'm shocked! How did I lose?
What can I tell you about Pokémon?Well, there are males and females. And some that you can't tell.
Oh, hi! We meet again! Have you seen any rare Pokémon?
Oh, I don't know. Should I play a little?
Oh, boo! How insulting!
Listen very closely...Can you hear the cries of Pokémon?
Oh, I don't know. Should I play a little again?
There's no mountain here, but I'm dressed to hike! Gahaha! Here goes!
Oh, yeah! A refreshing battle that was!
You can find the same kinds of Pokémon in all sorts of places.There's no law saying a hiker can't go searching wherever they please!
If you meet someone in the mountains, they're no longer strangers.Meet them twice—they're your friend!
Of all places possible, I've lost my way here.
Having lost his way, the Trainer lost the battle, too.
From being lost in the mountains so long, I became a hiker.
I've lost my way again. I'm betrayed by my sense of direction.
Hey! I'm not trained to hold back!
I...I concede! You're in a different class...
You taught me how I measure up! Thank you!
Hey! This time, I'm fully committed!
I love Pokémon that smell sweet. Like this one—get a whiff of this!
Did you understand what I meant? Didn't my Pokémon smell nice?
If you plant lots of Berries, you can be surrounded by sweet scents.
*sniff*Oh? Your Pokémon smells nice!
Nothing's biting, so I could use a break,I suppose.
Oh, well. I should've been a little more serious about this.
!Yank your fishing rod when that appears.That's how you fish.
All right! I caught some tough Pokémon. I'm ready for battle!
I landed myself a feisty Trainer! Let's go!
I let a big win slip away...
Do you have a fishing rod? Catch some big ones!
Hey, you feisty tyke! I caught me a big one!Let's battle again!
I fished up some tough Pokémon! Let's have ourselves a battle!
Losing has my emotions all knotted up!
My feet are tangled, too! Ouch! Ouch!
I'm going to win this time! I said I'll win, and I mean it!
Yo! Having a good time cycling?
Hey, not bad, you!
Cycling Road's teeming with Pokémon Trainers, too!
I'm sure I've seen your face before. Did we maybe battle?
Hey! Watch where you're going! Or did you want to challenge me?
My efforts were meaningless...
I might try racing through Cycling Road in one long shot.
There you are!I've been riding in this spot so I'd get a rematch with you!
Your bike is the type that can shift gears, huh?Let me see if you know how to ride it properly.
*crash* *brrring*
Huh? I was supposed to be checking if you know how to shift gears. Why am I checking out your Pokémon?
Let me see if you've learned how to ride your bike properly...in battle!
The bicycle can only take you as far as your energy will allow.
*gasp*
My Pokémon is out of gas. So am I.I'm going to head home soon.
I got plenty of rest at home. I'm not losing this time!
I worked up a good sweat riding! I'm feeling great! Let's battle!
Whew! You worked us over.
Do you find yourself pedaling backward while going downhill?
I worked up a good sweat riding! I feel ready for a rematch!
You and I, we're both riding bikes.And you've got Pokémon. I don't want to lose to you!
Oh, geez, I seem to have fallen off my bike.
Instead of a battle, I should've challenged you to a bike race!
I hate knowing you've beaten me. This time, I'm going to win!
I love my bike!But I'm not very good at fixing flat tires.
*kerash*
I admire people who understand gadgets.I'm clueless about how my Pokétch works.
I want to practice repairing flat tires...But I've been practicing with my Pokémon to get our revenge!
Some people compete over speed, and some compete over technique.Which kind are you?
You're a speedy technician!
I enjoy the scenery.Don't you think the area below Cycling Road looks nice?
I polished up both my speed and techniques.Can you beat me now?
Whoa! You startled me! Well, we may as well battle!
Your power startles me!
We hikers are bighearted guys! Losing doesn't bother us!
Whoa! You startled me! We may as well have a rematch!
I wear shorts the whole year! I've got energy to burn!
Having lots of energy isn't good enough.
My Pokémon don't wear anything. I worry that they'll be cold.
I wear shorts! I have lots of energy! I'm not losing to you!
Go for it, my Pokémon! I'll do my best, too!
Oh...we lost.
Did you know? You can dig up Fossils in the Grand Underground!Those Fossils can be turned back into Pokémon at the mining museum!
Go for it, my Pokémon! I'll do more than my best this time!
Go do it, my Pokémon! I'll work hard, too!
Oh...we lost.
I think we'll go visit the TV station in Jubilife City next.
Umm...you're the Trainer who beat us before,aren't you?We're feeling good today, so let's have another battle!
Wahaha! Laughter brings good fortune!
Wahahaha! There's nothing that I can do but laugh!
Wahaha! Go ahead and laugh at me!
Wahaha!Laughter brings good fortune! Forgetting your gloves brings a cold!
I just got through Mount Coronet, but we've still got fuel in the tank!
Whoops! Didn't take much to beat us!
We need to rest up in Oreburgh City before heading to Mount Coronet again.
I just got through Mount Coronet, and who do I see? A Trainer who we've battled before!
OK, OK! Let's be quick about this!
No way! Give us another battle!...Oh, right. I'm out of Pokémon.
Yup! I like the way you battle.
What took you so long? We've waited here a long time for a rematch with you!
Gahahaha! You're just a little kid!How're you supposed to beat a big man like me?
I'm a grown-up, but I got served by some little kid!
Wow, you're sure impressive!I guess it makes no difference if you're young or old in Pokémon battles.
Hey, you, tough little kid! Throw us a rematch,will you?
They call me the Echo Man! Battle with me!Yahoo!
Ohh...yo...yodelay...
Let the Echo Man give you a good word of advice!If you don't know where you should be going,check the Town Map.
Oh, hi there! Remember us? I'm the Echo Man!Let's have another battle! Yahoo!
If I beat you, will you share some food with me?
We were starved for food, and now we're starved for a win.
*sigh* I feel even hungrier. Maybe I'll chow down some Berries.But should I really eat Berries? What am I,a Pokémon?
I, uh, chowed down my packed lunch before we started climbing.If I beat you this time, share some food with me!
This karate man will pulverize you!
I still lack power.
I need to work out more. My Pokémon does, too!
This karate man hasn't forgotten being pulverized by you!
Eee-hee-hee! I'll haul you up and out!
My favorite word is "restraint." Especially in battle.
You need a Good Rod if you want to catch good Pokémon.
Eee-hee-hee! There won't be any restraint this time, OK?
Oh, you want to have a battle?I was meaning to enter a Super Contest Show,but beating you won't take long.
Oh, you have us beaten.
You and your Pokémon have so much energy.I think you would do well in Super Contest Shows, too.
Oh, didn't we meet before?I was meaning to enter a Super Contest Show,but let's have a quick battle first.
You and I!Let us create a scene—a fantastic tableau of battle!
Magnificent! I am aglow with inspiration!
That battle will surely become a stupendous masterpiece painting!I shall title it..."Pokémon Can Win!"
The key to becoming a good painter is to be observant.The same can be said for battling—one must be observant!
Let me see how much you've raised your Pokémon.
Good stuff! Your Pokémon are in impeccable condition.
It's obvious you raise your Pokémon with a lot of love.
I've raised my Pokémon since we met. How much have you raised yours?
Listen, if you don't mind, I'd like to have a battle with your Pokémon.
*giggle* They're raised with a lot of care!
If you treat your Pokémon with care, they'll reward you with friendship and loyalty.
I don't want to ever battle with people who don't treat Pokémon nicely!But I know you treat yours kindly. I'll battle you anytime!
Hi, there! Where're you from? What kinds of Pokémon have you got?
Fancy folks like you have fancy Pokémon too,it looks like.
I hope my pa didn't spy me slacking off from work here.
Oh, howdy! Come visiting again? What kinds of Pokémon'd you bring?
I jog every morning to keep my Pokémon fit.
Oops! You threw off my running rhythm.
Being healthy is number one! Why don't you come running with me?
Do you jog every morning, too?
When I go on my jogs, I pass by lots of people.I have trouble remembering faces, but we did meet before, right?
Hi, hi! I'm a Pokémon!
I'm so angry...
I want to be a Pokémon when I grow up!
Hi, hi! I'm a Pokémon!I think you already know, but we're going to battle again!
You're not supposed to intrude on my time with Sue!
I only have eyes for Sue. Maybe that's why we lost?
Sue, even in defeat, you're so beautiful!
I don't want to do anything without Sue...Bring two Pokémon at least, OK?
Did you come back to intrude on my time with Sue?
Huh? You want to battle with me?I will if I can team with Ty!
I'm sorry, Ty!
We lost. Ty, I need a hug to make it all better!
I only want to do things with Ty!Don't you have two Pokémon?
Oh, it's you again! I'll battle if I can team with Ty!
Jogging is about rhythm. Battling is about rhythm, too!
In a sense, I suppose that was a finish line of sorts.
When your rhythm gets thrown off, everything seems out of whack.
When I was jogging the other day, a wild Pokémon came after me.I ran so fast, I was on top of the waves, I swear.
Jogging is about rhythm. Battling is about rhythm, too. Our rematch is also about rhythm!
We battle together! That's why we're tough!
Waaah!
You're awesome! Are you maybe a Pokémon genius?
We won't play with you if you don't have two Pokémon!
When I battle with Lil, we shouldn't lose!
We're gonna crunch and munch you all up!
Hwaaah!
We're going to be tough Trainers, too!We decided!
Only one Pokémon is too lonesome!
You munched us all up last time—but it's our turn now!
Hey, check this out! Look at the luster of my Pokémon's fur!
Hey, hey, did you take a good look?
Every day, I brush my Pokémon a hundred strokes. Then, I do me.
I brushed my party a lot. So we'd be ready for a rematch!
I'm a rookie breeder, but I'll do my very best!
It's all right! I'm still a rookie!
How to raise Pokémon? Umm...it's all about love, right?
I can't be a rookie forever. I've learned a lot since we last met.
Yay! We're gonna battle with lots of Pokémon!
Even with both of us, we lost.
Our mommy is a twin, too.
We want to battle with lots of Pokémon.
Yay! We're gonna battle with lots of Pokémon again!
Yay! We're gonna have a battle with three Trainers!
We two couldn't win.
When Mommy and Aunty and me and Teri get together, it's really confusing and fun!
We want to have a battle with four Pokémon.
Yay! We're gonna have another battle with three Trainers!
My Pokémon toughened up from working on the ranch.I'm right proud of them!
Hahahah! Your Pokémon sure can be counted on!
When I touch my Pokémon, I can feel not just their bodies' warmth, but their compassion.
Howdy! You're that tough little Trainer!I remember you!Check out my farm-toughened Pokémon! They're my pride and joy!
I'm warmed up and limber. I'm OK to battle!
Um... I wasn't emotionally ready.
Actually, I wanted to make a run for it.That's a joke.
I'm going to keep running. Just as long as there's a road...
I've been training so I can have a rematch with you.I'm OK to battle!
Uhohoho! I'll show y'all how tightly I've bonded with my daughter!
Parent-and-child power couldn't get the job done.
I reckon the bonds between you and your Pokémon are like the bonds parents share with their kids.
Oh, there's no way you could beat us both with one Pokémon.
Ayuh? You're here to check the bond I have with my daughter again?
I can get away with slacking off if I have my Pokémon out!
Oh, sheesh!
Papa, I'm sorry! I promise I'll work harder starting tomorrow!
You're battling me and my pa. One Pokémon won't cut it, dear!
Oh, hi! It's good y'all came calling on us again!I can take a break from work if I'm battling Pokémon. Lucky for me!
I'm one of the Ninja Trio! Being discovered means I must battle!
I concede defeat.
My cover is blown, so what should I do?Maybe I'll go catch some Super Contest Shows in Hearthome City. Maybe I'll do that.
Do you remember me? I'm one of the Ninja Trio!Being discovered means I must battle!
I'm one of the Ninja Trio! Being discovered means I must battle!
I concede defeat.
While I hid in the tall grass, I sensed Pokémon all around me!Furtive sounds of movement...stifled cries...I heard them!
You don't remember me? I'm one of the Ninja Trio! Being discovered means I must battle!
I'm one of the Ninja Trio! Being discovered means I must battle!But how did you discover me? Don't tell me you're a ninja, too!
I concede defeat.
A Pokémon Trainer's good at finding stuff,I guess.
You should join us so we can form the Ninja Quartet!Anyway, let's battle!
You seem to have a lot of confidence. Let's see if it's justified!
Haha! A total loss for me!
You seem to have an abundance of talent.It's pretty amazing.
When I lost to you last time, I was just unlucky.
As an Ace Trainer, I have to take battles in stride.I need to stay cool and calm whether I win or lose.
Aiyeeeeh! We lost!
How dare you beat us! Go away! Go!
Last time, I got a little emotional over losing...I'll stay cool and calm today!
Me, lose to someone so young? I daresay not!
The power of youth... It's startling.
Somehow, it makes me happy seeing a young,yet surefooted, Trainer such as yourself.
The power of youth and the technique of the Veteran...Let us battle again to see which shall prevail!
This buff physique isn't just for show!
Ugwaaaah!
Why? Is it because my training wasn't enough?!
My buff physique! Feast your eyes on it again!
I just startled you!While you're still struggling to recover, I'll already be the winner!
What's with you? You didn't give me any openings!
I need a better reaction out of you. I feel silly hiding for so long!
You just saw me, and I bet you thought,"Long time no see."While you're still thinking that, I'll already be the winner!
We ninjas appear where you least expect us!
I didn't expect to lose.
When I hide out like this, I think about what it must be like for Pokémon inside their Poké Balls.
Wah! Another chance encounter with a foe who defeated me before!
A ninja can use all sorts of cool techniques!
Hmm...my ninja techniques failed to work.
There's a ninja Gym Leader somewhere far away.I should become a devotee of theirs.
What's with you? You're not a ninja yet?
Don't be shocked when you see my Pokémon!
Oh... My... Gosh...
Dragon Pokémon are usually much more powerful than this!
You again?You must really like that dragon Pokémon I use.
I'll teach you about the charms of bird Pokémon!
Wow. I admit, I'm quite surprised.
The sight of you battling... It was simply a wonder to watch!
Do you finally understand the appeal of bird Pokémon?
Jen, watch this! I'm going to use everything you've taught me!
Wow. Someone that's even better than Jen...
I don't care if I get to meet the greatest Trainer in the region. I'd still rather learn from Jen.
Wouldn't you rather battle with the two of us?
This time, I'm not gonna let you down, Jen!I promise!
Here comes a Trainer. Zac, you ready?Let's do this!
I just got embarrassed in front of my little buddy here...
Zac, I'm so sorry. I'm a failure as your instructor.
Would you like to have a two-on-two Pokémon battle with us?
Here comes our Trainer! Are you ready this time?
Look at these beautiful wings!
Oh, you! I'm going to peck you for that!
How come bird Pokémon have such beautiful feathers?Hold one up to the sun and you can see so many colors in it.
My bird Pokémon has such gorgeous wings.It must have been some sort of a mistake that we lost last time!
"Zubat!" Doesn't that sound like a ninja bursting from cover?
Oh! My Zubat tri-stars...
Sowing confusion among foes is one way a ninja battles.A confused Pokémon can't show its full power!
The shinobi live by speed! I'll get in my attacks before you!
See how Mount Coronet towers above us. I want to be big like that one day!
A powerful presence towers before me—it's you!
Mount Coronet has long been known as an ancient and mysterious mountain.
Hmm?! You tower before me again?It's as if you're Mount Coronet!
Hah! Hah! I'm psyched for this! Here goes!
I don't get why we can't win.
I guess I ought to study winning techniques for a change.
Hah! Hah! This time, I'm psyched up!
Speed is a ninja's best weapon! Can you keep up?
I did a lot to conceal myself, too.
I'll wait here for a weaker-looking Trainer and then ambush them!
I became even faster! How can you hope to keep up?
I go everywhere with my Noctowl. We're gonna show you owl best! Ha!
We did our best. That's what matters. Right?
Even on cold days, just being with my Noctowl keeps me warm!
I curled up inside my Noctowl's wings and waited for you to return!
Whilst exploring the ruins, I spotted a Trainer!I must investigate!
My investigation revealed the Trainer to be tough!
Celestic Town is an old town. I'm sure to find something cool.
Whilst exploring the ruins, I spotted you again!I will now investigate!
I'll have you know my Pokémon sleeps on a fancy imported bed.
Humph! There's an unseemly sense of desperation about you. Ugh!
Oh, my poor little battler is all tuckered out...I'll let it sleep in that bed I had sent from overseas.
I do this only because I love my Pokémon.Winning isn't that important.
I'd like to begin now. Are you quite prepared?
Oh, how very impressive of you.
Would you care to inform me of who the amazing tutor you've hired for your Pokémon is?
Oh, I'm delighted to see you again.Are you prepared?
If it pleases you, would you care for a Pokémon battle with me?
Your handling of Pokémon is impeccable.
Bahaha! I was invited by the master of the Pokémon Mansion.
If it pleases you, would you care for a rematch with me?
I've never battled a young Trainer like you before. I'm quite nervous!
Oh, dear... That wasn't anything like battling with my friends.
Usually, I'll have matches with members of my social club.
Oh, it's you again, dear?It makes me a little nervous, but may I have a rematch?
Good evening, Trainer! Fancy a quick nighttime Pokémon battle?
You've got tough partners with you. Carry on,Trainer. Carry on.
Out so late? Does your mother know you're out at this hour?
Why, hello there!It's always nice when a Trainer stops and says hi to us police officers!
Good evening, Trainer! Now let's see how our Pokémon greet each other—in battle!
I was just wondering whether my Pokémon would have a chance to battle tonight.
I guess I need to train my Pokémon some more.
More Pokémon training is always better.
Patrolling night and day sure is exhausting.*yawn*
What a pleasant, quiet evening.Let's give our Pokémon some exercise!
Let's enjoy a fierce battle in the chilly night winds! Brrrr! Refreshing!
It was too dark for me to see very well. Yeah...Too dark.
Oops, I'd better get back to my beat before the boss radios me.
Hi! Hanging in there, Trainer?
Still training this late?I admire that kind of dedication, Trainer!
I'm on patrol to see whether or not there's any trouble afoot!
Big trouble! I need backup Pokémon!
Your toughness is too much!I'm in serious trouble!
Just between you and me, all this patrolling can get pretty demanding.
Let me ask you a question! Have you trained your Pokémon as well as I have?
Can't you see I'm fishing? Don't talk! You'll startle the fish!
Sheesh...I let a Pokémon—and that battle—get away from me.
Fishing and battling are delicate things, as am I.Is that wrong?
You can see I'm fishing, can't you? Then don't talk to me! Geez!
I wish some fishing-loving lady'd come along.But no, it's all just Trainers.
Sure, so I lost. But I'll keep on fishing.
If you know of any ladies who like fishing,help me reel one in!
Umm...yeah. Weren't you that person who preferred Pokémon over fishing?
Water Pokémon sure get happy when it rains.So do I!
Oof. Just got trampled right under your feet that time!
Yup, a kid like you should be running around outside, rain or shine.
I've been fishing here ever since I lost to you.
Can you keep up with us?
You've got energy to burn!
However hard you battle, make sure you never harm the environment.Try not to break any branches or trample any plants, OK?
Hey! You're that high-energy Trainer! I bet you can't keep up with us now!
Are you doing your part to protect the environment? I am!
Good. You seem to be a kindhearted Trainer.
People, Pokémon—all of us! We're all a part of nature.
Heya, long time!Are you enjoying your nature-filled adventure with Pokémon?
Our job is to protect the natural environment of this region.
We have to get tougher than this...
I love how natural it is here. I wish I could live out here.
What do you think? The environment is unharmed in this area.
I find it reassuring to be on this damp soil.
Ufufufufu...you had to beat me.
It feels good to mope here after a loss. Ufufufu...
Is Damp your favorite Pokémon Ability? Fufufu...Anything will do.
I'm proud of my Pokémon! Here, I'll show you why!
Youch! You sure showed me how tough you were.
Oh, what have we here? That's a Pokédex!It records Pokémon data upon sight? I've never seen one before!I heard you can move the sun or moon icon to check the Pokémon habitat map by time of day!
I take down details in my notebook about Pokémon I've battled.I'll write more data down about your Pokémon!
Oh? Here comes a nice Trainer. This is worth evaluation.
Our research arrived at this one conclusion:you're tough!
A huge variety of Pokémon live in the Great Marsh.You see, countless years ago, this whole area was under the sea.
Oh, how do you do? May I investigate how much tougher you've become since our last encounter?
There are Pokémon that become more powerful when it rains.
When I lose, my tears fall like rain...They call me Rain Woman...
I want to show off my pretty parasol, but it will get dirty in the rain.Oh, such a big dilemma!
On rainy days, I get more energetic!
When it rains, I get happy!
It's not very easy trying to battle while holding an umbrella.
If it rained every day, I could have my umbrella open all the time.
It's not because it's raining—I just love umbrellas!
My Pokémon and I are always prepared!
I was completely unprepared for this...
You aren't just well prepared—you're tough!
We're on constant patrol. Even at night, it's safe around here.
My Pokémon and I are better prepared this time!
I swim the whole year round. I'm not losing a battle at sea!
I lost in the sea—but I swim the whole year round!
When you're out at sea, Water-type Pokémon look more lively.
I love the sea. It was only by fluke that I lost last time.
Brr...I'm starting to get chilly. I could use a win to get warmed up.
The chill of the sea...the coldness of defeat...It's a double whammy.
Look at my lips—they're the color of prunes!
Brr...I'm starting to feel chilly. How about a hot Pokémon battle?
Hi, wave-riding Trainer! How about a battle on the sea?
You sure schooled me there.
Maybe I should switch to surfing, too...
Oh, hi again! You're that wave-riding Trainer!
Hello, there! Aren't you going to swim?
What's saltier, my tears or the sea?
There aren't many sea routes that you can swim in Sinnoh.It makes me want to take a vacation in the Hoenn region.
When I see people surfing, I don't feel jealous or anything.I just simply love to swim!
Isn't this nice? I love my inner tube!
I couldn't move very well because my inner tube got in the way!
My mom blew up my inner tube for me. I ran out of breath just opening it!
You can come back all you like, but you can't have my inner tube!
Eheheh...I can battle, too!
I lost, and now I feel hungry.
That cloud looks like ice cream! I wish I could eat some! Mmm...
I've been lounging here all this time!
Traveling alone, are you? That's impressive! How about we battle?
You're good, pip-squeak!
Maybe I'll go work out down at the restaurant again.That place gets different people in every day,and they all like battles.
Hey, lonesome traveler! Let's break the monotony with another battle!
Awwww! I almost had that fish reeled in!
You need to have more respect for a grown-up.
You need to settle down some.
Awwww! I was just reeling that fish in!Oh, no, not you again!
Let me demonstrate my technique. It's how this grown-up battles.
That's how you attack? Pshaw!
You're so much more of a Trainer than you look!
Give this grown-up another chance to demonstrate her technique.
This area seems to be very mystifying. That's the sense I get.To show you what I mean, I'll battle with the Pokémon I found.
I can't win with Pokémon that I'm not familiar with.
This area seems to be very mystifying. That's the sense I get.
Ah-ha! I found me a Trainer!I challenge you to battle with the Pokémon I've found!
I've been traveling around the world chasing stories on mysteries.It's made me pretty tough!
*sigh* That's a downer.
There are mysteries waiting for me to investigate around the world.This is no time to be feeling sorry for myself.
There's an endless supply of mysteries around the world.Running into you here just happens to be one such mystery!
I'd sensed the presence of a Trainer for a while.It was you!
Defeating you will be no easy matter.
Is it possible to become more powerful by understanding Pokémon?
I was certain that you'd return. I sensed your presence, you see.
Look out! Behind you! What is it?
My plan to scare you didn't go over well at all.
You might be tough, but let down your guard at your own risk!
Whoa! That thing curled around your neck!...Nice scarf, kid!
Win or lose...who knows how this'll go?We're playing for keeps!
I guessed wrong too often.
I can't get into the groove. That's enough for today.
I wasn't lucky the other day. Things will be different today.
For the sake of my collection, I take on people I know I can't beat.That's what a collector does.
You should boast more about that last attack.
I'm proud of having a Pokémon that others don't have.Oh, and I'm also proud of winning the second prize on Jubilife TV's daily drawings.
For the sake of my collection, I keep battling people I can't beat.That's what a collector does.
Whaaat? You do! You do have a Pokédex!
I'm so envious of your Pokédex.
Trainers have all sorts of Pokémon with them, right?So, the more Trainers you battle, the more your Pokédex will fill up!
I don't have a Pokédex, but that's all right.You come here and show me!
To find my favorite Pokémon, I'll go east, west,or any which way!
But they're my favorite Pokémon!
If you're trying to find the Pokémon you want,you need to go everywhere!Not just east and west, either. South and north are important, too!
For my favorite Pokémon, I'll go east, west, or any which way!Saying that, I've been wandering around here all this time.
Oh? You want to teach me something about Pokémon?
Wow, is that right?
There are so many kinds of Pokémon. I can't decide which one to pamper.
Yoo-hoo, little kid! Can you teach me some more about Pokémon?
I was snoozing, you claim? I merely feigned sleep! Hiyah!
*gurgle*
I feigned a loss! Hiyah!
Am I lost, you ask? I merely feigned it! Hiyah!
Check the sharpness of my Fighting-type Pokémon's moves.
You've dulled its sharpness...
Back to training for us!
I sharpened my Pokémon's moves more for when I saw you again!
Every drop of sweat I shed makes me that much stronger!
I don't want to believe this happened, but a loss is a loss.
Time to shed some more sweat!
We're going to win this time! Don't believe me?Then you test it out!
*huff huff huff huff*Want—*huff*—a battle? *huff*
*huff huff*We—*huff*—lose. *huff*
Bye—*huff*—now. *huff**huff huff huff huff*
Running—*huff*—is—*huff*—good. *huff*Over—*huff*—doing—*huff*—it isn't! *huff**huff huff huff huff*
*huff huff huff huff*We—*huff*—meet—*huff*—again? *huff*
I'll battle anyone. That's how I'll get better!
You won and I lost, but the both of us gained something from this.
In a Pokémon battle, it doesn't matter how old or young you are.Your gender doesn't matter, either. Nothing like that means anything!
I'll battle against people who've beaten me again and again.By doing that, we both grow a little as Trainers.
I'm taking the Veilstone Gym challenge.But first...
You made me lose my confidence...
I think about Pokémon all day long. I was confident, you know.
Oh, it's you again!I've regained my confidence. Let's have another battle!
I'm a treasure hunter. Today, the loot is a victory from you!
I can't win. You're too much to take!
If one's after treasures, maybe looking underground is the better choice.
I'm a treasure hunter. This time, I will have my trophy: a victory from you!
If I battle now, won't it mess up my usual pace?
My pace is completely off...
Sticking to one's own goal is more important than it seems.If you match your goal with someone else, you'll lose your identity.
Well, yes, sometimes I do walk. I even stop on occasion. I am human, after all.
Up till now, I'd maintained my pace.But seeing you threw me off!
I'm an ace. I can see that you're an ace, too!
Just as I thought...
You can pretend to be ordinary, but your eyes tell me another story.
A real ace doesn't get hung up on getting wins.A real ace sets sights consistently higher to improve themselves.
I always battle for keeps. This is no drill!
Good job! That was an excellent battle.
If you don't play for keeps, you'll lose battles you should be dominating.
When I lost to you last time, I was battling for keeps.But this time, I really mean it. This is seriously for keeps!
I'm fully kitted up and equipped! Anytime will be fine!
Hunh?!
Perhaps I should maybe change into a more comfy outfit...
I'm fully equipped again today! Anytime you're ready will be fine!
To be ready to answer any call! To be ready to accept any challenge!That is the way of a Trainer!
How disappointing!
You can make all the preparations in the world,but if it doesn't work, it doesn't work.
I got everything ready so we could have a rematch whenever you came.
I'm skiing right now, but OK. As we skiers say,"Spur thing!"
...I've hit an ice patch!
I quite enjoyed that battle! Let us meet again.Ski ya!
We might get snowbound, but why not? It's on the "spur" of the moment!
Are you a novice? Or are you capable?
I never expected you to be an expert...
You know how to play your Pokémon with an edge!
Knowing you to be an expert, I challenge you to a rematch!
What's fun about winter? Number one: skiing!Number two: Pokémon!
*snivel*
If it was skiing, I wouldn't lose. I should go ski with my Pokémon...
You're a better Trainer than a skier. But I'll challenge you again anyway!
How do you expect to battle in this heavy snow?
The winds of victory shifted...
You even had the cold winds on your side.I guess you kids are tougher than people my age.
Why would you wander around here? You must really like it here.
I can withstand this cold. That means I can take any kind of attack!
Huh? It's over, you say?
Oh gosh, this is bad! I think I'm losing feeling all over my body!
Oh? I've seen your face before. What say we battle?
This cold is but nothing compared to the fire that burns in my heart!
Your heart burns as hot as mine!
The weather clears up sometimes. The view is breathtaking then.
We'll come at you with our hearts ablaze!
Wh-what is it? P-Pokémon battle?!
Whew... You are alive, aren't you?
Around these parts, perhaps because of all the snow, there are many folktales of hauntings...
This isn't like last time. See how much I've trained since then!
I'll show you the techniques I had drummed into me at ski school!
I don't believe it... My techniques were rebuffed...
I should have enrolled in a Pokémon Trainers' school...
Since I lost to you last time, I redid my training at ski school!
We skiers feel Mother Nature through the soles of our feet!
I got a good taste of your power!
Trainers get an appreciation of life through Pokémon. At least I think so.
I knew you were headed back here. I felt it with the soles of my feet!
I've been skiing with Pokémon since I was just five years old.
Oh, um, wait... What?!
The scenery doesn't change very much around here. Don't go getting lost!
Oh... Did you maybe get lost again? You should pay more attention!
Rainy days make me feel blue...But the instant it starts to snow, I'm as happy as can be!
The conditions weren't very good.
Does your Pokétch have that hidden move to climb cliffs?
You really must like snow. After all, if you didn't,I doubt that you'd come here so often!
*poof*You've got a good eye, spotting me!
You also saw through my weak spots...
I'll play with my Pokémon—even in a blizzard!
*poof*You saw through my camouflage again!
There are several kinds of ninjas. Are you an Iga or a Kouga ninja?
I'm not much of a ninja either way...
I wonder why everyone stops being a ninja when they grow up?
I forged my willpower in the snow! Witness my snowy might!
To make sure I'm more agile, I always dress light!
Achoo!
I might have to go home and dress warmer than this...
I'm sticking it out and staying lightly dressed!
Yeah, yeah... Nothing's biting!
...
When nothing's biting, the smart thing to do is just call it a day.
Yeah, yeah... Nothing's biting today either.
Outdoor fishing for the win!Shouting doesn't help my fishing any, but shout I must!
Gwaaah! This is hurting!
Oh, right... My shouting is scaring away the Pokémon.
Super outdoor fishing! Shouting still doesn't help!
Let it rock! It's the rhythm of battle!
Can you hear it? That's my guitar, weeping...
I'm too torn up to sing anymore... I am so cool that way...
Rock 'n' roll! We'll beat it out again: our rhythm of battle!
A man of the sea is also a man of Pokémon!
Anchors aweigh!
You've got what it takes to be a Trainer among Trainers!
Rudder hard to starboard! Hold on!Nobody go overboard!
I love my inner tube. So I admire jellyfish Pokémon!
I'm drifting away...
I wish Professor Rowan would give me a Pokédex.But that old guy looks kind of scary.
I love my inner tube. So I admire jellyfish Pokémon.Won't you hang out with us and just bob around on the waves?
I can't swim without my floaty. But my Pokémon sure can!
They weren't tough, my Pokémon...
My mommy said that Professor Rowan is really kindhearted.
Oh! You're the Trainer who played with us before!Can you see if my Pokémon have grown stronger?
I only live to swim. Teach me what's so fun about Pokémon!
Wow, that was fun!
I'll try swimming with Pokémon next.
Yo! You're that Trainer who taught me how fun Pokémon can be.Let's have another battle, you and me!
On your marks... Get set...
Owowowow! My leg cramped up!
I forgot to do my stretching exercises...
Hi, I was waiting for you!Ready? On your marks... Get set...
OK! Get your breathing in order! OK! You're ready to go!
I let my momentum falter...
Listen, I have something important to say to you.Don't drown in your own talent.
OK! You're ready to go! This time, I'm going for the win!
Swimming is a full-body exercise. You should swim, too!
Sunk like a stone!
Well, Pokémon's one thing, but you should take up swimming, too!
Hiya, Pokémon-riding Trainer! You should be swimming like me!
The human body floats more easily in the sea, so it's easy to swim!
The water's too salty!
I've got that sinking feeling...
Pokémon can stay afloat even while carrying someone. That's so cool!
I may not look it now, but I'm a star. I'm always with my Pokémon.
I lost, but at least I had fun.
If it were an underwater Pokémon show, I would have shined.
Oh, hi! Are you back to see our Pokémon show again?
I bought a new bikini! It's this year's newest model!
Psssssh!
I made a mistake buying this bikini... It's a little too tight...
Did I show you already? My bikini, new for this year!
Well? Does it look like I'm swimming gracefully?
I'm finally feeling fatigued...
I may look like I'm swimming gracefully, but beneath the surface, I'm kicking furiously.
You were attracted by my graceful swimming again, weren't you?
Water-type Pokémon come in a great variety of shapes and sizes.I'll show you the Water Pokémon that I've picked for myself!
I can't boast when I lose... I'm so disappointed...
Sure I lost, but watch me! I'll get tougher with Water Pokémon.
This time, my Water Pokémon will show you why I'm so proud of them!
Hey. I like fishing. But my true love is battling!
*sploosh*
If you don't know how to fish, you're missing half of life's enjoyment.If you don't know Pokémon...you're missing out on all of it!
Come on—battle me again! You know I love to fish and battle!
People consider me an Ace Trainer.Let me demonstrate the skills that earned me that title!
I'm burning with jealousy over your raw talent!
I think keeping up the effort to better yourself is a talent in itself.
Last time, you beat me before I had a chance to show you my skill.This time, I'll show you why they consider me an ace!
Oh? You intend to beat me? I am an ace,you know.
I see... I have to concede defeat.
To not be depressed by a loss... That's one trait of an ace.
Ace Trainers always work to improve their natural-born talents.
You're going to Ramanas Park?It's not right that you get to go before a collector like me!
You're one enthusiastic Trainer.
Ramanas Park, huh? I wonder what kinds of Pokémon you can see there?
Listen—did you go to Ramanas Park? What was it like? What was it like?
I'm in the middle of fishing, but OK. I'll be happy to sink you.
Whooah!
The one that got away was a big one...
Once I hook it, no fish gets away from me!A Trainer walking by also can't get free of my clutches!
Hi, traveler! How would you like to battle?
You sure showed me up.
I like to fish. You're a traveler.Farewell, until we meet again!
Hi, traveler! I've forgotten your name, but we've battled before, haven't we?
I'm getting bored of fishing. Let's have a quick battle!
I've been done in...
Thanks, Trainer. That was a good change of pace.
Yo! I remember how our battle was a good change of pace before.Let's have another quick battle!
If I stare at the water's surface for too long, I begin to forget what I was doing in the first place.
I don't know how, but I lost!
Oh, right... I was fishing, wasn't I?
When I looked up from staring at the water's surface, I saw your face.I'm not sure about what I was just doing, but do you want to battle?
It takes both brains and brawn when you're out at sea.Aye, it's not an easy job, the sailor's life!
*glub glub glub*
If you were to become a sailor, I'm sure you'd make a good one!
I'll beat you this time and convince you to become a sailor!
Oh, we'll ride upon the sea,in a boat, just you and me! ♪ That's the way of the sailor! Way of the sailor. ♪ You sing, too!
Your Pokémon... They're looking good!
You ought to think about becoming a sailor yourself.It's been great to be able to visit different places around the world.
Oh, we'll ride upon the sea,in a boat, just you and me! ♪ That's the way of the sailor! Way of the sailor. ♪ You sing, too!
Who's there?! Oh, it's only a kid. You scared me!
I'm a bit of a scaredy-cat, so I'm always paying close attention to everything.
I'm no tough guy, and yet here I am on patrol.Funny how things go.
I can't explain why, but I'm more easily agitated at night—not that I let it get to me.
Hey, is that you again? You scared me! Again!Do you really want to battle that badly?
I'm quite bored. Care to break the monotony?
The monotony was broken, but at what cost?
I'll go rest at the hotel. I've had quite enough of this.
Ah, it's you. I'm bored yet again. Care to break the monotony?
After enjoying a meal at the hotel restaurant, one has a battle. That's the social etiquette.
Enchanting.
Personally, I would rather just play with Pokémon than battle with them.
I only seem to run into you after I go to the restaurant.Etiquette calls for a battle after a meal. Shall we?
Look, look! Look at my Pokémon! It's really cool!
Oof! I had to hold on tight to my inner tube!
Pools are OK, but I like the sea because Pokémon live there.
Yay! You came to see my Pokémon again, right?Look, look!
Listen, listen! Can you tell me what kind of Pokémon you have?
You're so tough. I'm stunned...
I want to hang on to a Buizel and just bob around.
Listen, listen! Did you find any new kinds of Pokémon?
I came out here because I wanted to see the Pokémon League for myself.
I'm shocked... No, really, I am.
The way I battle now, well, I can only look at the Pokémon League!You go on! You go to the Pokémon League for me, too!
I've been training here in hopes of going to the Pokémon League.
I've decided! If I can beat you, I'm going to the Pokémon League!
*blblblblugh*
It's OK. Just let me float away like driftwood...
I've decided! If I finally beat you, I'm headed for the Pokémon League!
It might not look like it, but I'm traveling now.
You've got the upper hand on me.
But you can be sure that there will be bigger challenges in front of you.Go! Go as far as you can! You alone can broaden your horizons.
I'm still on my journey... Let's have a battle!
The sea around here is harsh. It's made me just as harsh!
The world is so harsh...
What? You've got that many Gym Badges?No wonder you're so tough...
It's me again! The harsh sea here should have toughened me up more!
My dream is to swim in the sea in every region under the sun!
Boo! I'm not done with my dream!
I wonder what the seas are like in Kanto and Hoenn...
My new dream is to challenge all the Pokémon Leagues in every region!
Yes, I know I can surf, but I'd rather swim instead.It does seem weird—I agree.
*kaploosh*
If you don't know how, I'm willing to show you how to swim.
If you rely on your Pokémon all the time, you'll never learn how to swim!
I train at a Pokémon Gym, too. Don't think you're going to win easily!
Master Wake... No, Crasher Wake... I'm so sorry to have failed you...
What to do... Train at the Gym again, or train by myself...?
I trained at the Gym after you beat me. Let's do it, gang!
I'm determined to go to the Pokémon League, no matter how hard it is.
Th-this is so hard...
Losing won't make me give up. The Pokémon League isn't going anywhere.
It doesn't matter how long it takes—I'm going to the Pokémon League!
Excuse me for wearing my bikini!
Was I multitasking too much, battling and swimming at the same time?
When I'm in my bikini, I'm at a loss about where to carry my Poké Balls!
*giggle*Excuse me for wearing my bikini!
Deep breathing before battle!
Inhale... Exhale...
Deep breathing after battle, too!
Don't get careless, even if you're facing someone familiar.Do your deep-breathing exercises...
I found a Trainer who's floating in the water!
I've had my fill...
I'm tired of swimming, so I'll just float around and get some rest.
How much stronger have your Pokémon become?Let me check 'em out, OK?
Did you know? I was crowned the champion of a swimsuit contest!So now, I'm trying to win a title at a Super Contest Show!
I've been sunk!
I'll need to rework my strategy!
I became the champion of a swimsuit contest...I'm a super-talented girl!I'm challenging you so I can become the champ of a Super Contest Show!
My favorite kind of guy is someone that looks good out on the open sea!
The tide is going out...
...Though there's a mysterious nature that surrounds a mountain man...
Hello again! You're that Trainer who looks keen with their Pokémon!
Fine, all righty then. Just a quick battle on my break!
Wahaha! Mercy! I cry mercy!
I'd better get on back to work...You know, I'd rather be traveling around with Pokémon the way you do.
I'm gonna let you in on a secret... I snuck my Pokémon to work!
Well, now aren't you something!
OK, OK, time for work! I'll work up a thirst with my Pokémon!
What's cool, you might ask? No? I'll tell you anyway: bug Pokémon!
It bugs me when people ignore the awesome coolness of bug Pokémon!
It would seem that coolness alone doesn't add up to any wins...
Here comes the swarm!
Whoooh...
Did you know? "Swarm" is the name of a Pokémon Ability.
My senses tingle... I've spotted a rare Pokémon!
Awawawawah...
I thought it was a rare Pokémon, but it turned out to be just a Trainer!
We're just out on a power walk!
Oh, you!
Ewww, nasty! This forest is full of bug Pokémon...I also forgot to buy some Antidotes. It's just the worst thing ever!
When a Trainer and a Pokémon bond as one, a wondrous power is born...
Hmm...
There still remain many mysteries yet to be solved in this strange world...
A strange presence has been felt... It is emanating from...you!
Oh! Be one with me, my Meditite!
The Old Chateau... I sense...a particularly strong presence there.
I see it... I see it...I see you going down in defeat...
It is I that have gone down in defeat.
The Old Chateau...lies abandoned, with none living in its walls...And yet, and yet, there permeates a presence...
This forest is strange, you know... It seems to fill me with energy...
Your victory... There is nothing strange about it.
Forests are mystifying... They seem to gather such unexplainable energy.
You... One look at you tells me you're a real contender!
You're as tough as you look.
One day, people will run to the other side of the road when I walk by 'em.It's a goal of mine I'm working on.
Victory Road... Somehow, it feels as if my journey is now coming to an end.But before the final chapter is written, I must pen your defeat!
That wasn't how I planned the final chapter to go in my writing class...
If you don't give up, you can reach your goal.That perseverance is what's important to Trainers.That's in my book, too.
Show me how you've battled to get here!Let's do this!
So, that's how you battled...?
Once you emerge from Victory Road, the Pokémon League lies directly ahead...But many Trainers fail to ever find their way on Victory Road...
This total stranger'll be a good way to see if I have what it takes to own the Pokémon League's Elite Four!
That battle just now must make you tougher than everyone in the world.
It doesn't appear as if anyone could even try to stand against your might.The Elite Four should just surrender.
I can sense that your Pokémon have a lot of trust in you.You and your Pokémon... You seem to be aglow.
Ah, I understand it now!
You blaze with so much vitality!
Let me take a measure of how much you have raised your Pokémon!
Brilliant!
Rather than navigating Victory Road, I have a much better time putting young Trainers like you to the test.
I'm making an already-strong Pokémon grow even stronger. I'll need your help with this!
There's no way I could have won!
Now how am I gonna teach it the most powerful Dragon-type moves...? Well?
Top-level Trainers gather around this place naturally.I'd go so far as to call it the ideal place to train with the best!
That's why I like it here; I get to battle tough characters like you.
When two roads diverge, you must choose the path less traveled...
My Pokémon knows karate! I'm warning you.It's a tough one!
I've met my match in strength!
I've made it this far in life using the karate I learned on the internet!
I keep battling so I can soar ever higher into the skies!
It seems I've been grounded...
The wings of freedom...I know I'll find them if I can win my way through the Pokémon League...
Be warned, mortal! I can see the future!
So be it! I will now divulge what I know of your future... Hmm!
In the Pokémon League ahead, the Elite Four await you!But you knew that already.
I can see the past!
There's just so much in your past...
Did you... Did you meet a Legendary Pokémon?No. That can't be right...
It's a double team of aces! We're gonna overwhelm you!
You and your Pokémon will gain power by helping each other out.
The combination of you and your awesome Pokémon... It's the ultimate tag team!
If you don't mind, we're hoping for some two-on-two battle action.
We form a combination that's in perfect sync!How do you expect to counter that?
You and your Pokémon make a beautiful combination!
Yup, the way you battle is fantastic!You should try to take on the Elite Four right now—not later!
We want to have a battle without an advantage.Please come back when you have at least two Pokémon!
I intend to perfect my Double Battle technique.That will make me better all around.
You! You're an expert Double Battler, too!
Your mastery over several Pokémon at once...You're a remarkable Trainer!
You have but one Pokémon?I would say that you are taking Victory Road too lightly, kid.
I want to improve my technique as a Trainer,and as a Double Battler, as much as I can.
My goodness! You're great at Double Battles!
Depending on the combinations, every kind of Pokémon can excel. At least, that's what I think.
You're really going through Victory Road with only one Pokémon?
We Trainers will accept challenges anywhere!It's what we do.
Hmm... Insufficiently raised?
Gee... When you're in a cave, wild Pokémon can appear anytime!
To celebrate my getting through this cave, I'm going to battle you!
Well, I guess losing is something to commemorate, too...
Getting through this cave feels like an adventure.
I'm a Veteran, yes, but don't you dare treat me like a senior citizen!
Hnuuurgh... So much skill for one so young!
I'll always remain young at heart. Never let them say you're too old!
Oh, what's this? My last one! This is where we make our stand!
We're not done yet! There's no giving up!
Hmm! My sturdy Pokémon, defeated!
Aiyaah! We're coming out swinging with super-heavy judo chops!
That was...a complete trashing!
I must rededicate myself to training. The road extends into infinity...
Up and down you go on the lifts. Me?I like to battle!
You've got me feeling down!
I can't keep this up! I'll go back to working on the lifts.
A Pokémon Gym isn't only about seeing how tough your Pokémon happen to be.It's so much deeper than just that. It's a test of you as a person.
That move was devastating!
I get to work all day with my Pokémon—and even battle sometimes.I get all the fun I need every day!
An ace has the knowledge and experience of battling at high levels.I'll demonstrate what that means to a noob like you!
Wow... I'm in the mood to sing a lullaby...
Your earnest enthusiasm... I guess that kinda makes you an ace.Maybe you're a Trainer who has the potential to surpass aces!
By focusing on only one type, you can really see the strengths and weaknesses of that Pokémon.
My focus was too narrow-minded...
Start by learning to truly appreciate your Pokémon.If you do that, you'll learn naturally how you should battle with it.
Steel represents an unbending spirit!If you never give up, the path to victory reveals itself!
I never gave up, but still I failed to win...
If you give up, well, that's when everything ends for you!
Pokémon and people have worked together for many years.Let us show you an example of that history!
A spectacular loss! But it's still a loss!
The way you helped each other... That is what made you prevail!
What do you think you're doing to my Pokémon?!
This can't be! I lost?! You...you annoying brat!
I ain't fooling around, kid. This is how a professional does it!
You messed up my job... Now I'm not gonna get a bonus...
I hear they're going to do something with electricity, I think.
Collecting electricity from the Valley Windworks... That's our mission.
I really don't like kids who also happen to be tough Trainers...
You don't have an inkling of what Team Galactic is trying to achieve!Of course, they don't tell a grunt like me anything, either... But still!
This is why I'm gonna be stuck as a grunt forever...
If only I had some decent Pokémon...
Don't get cocky, kid! This isn't over yet!
My Pokémon's HP is low... This could be a bit tight.
What just happened? I lost?!
Don't get cocky, kid! This isn't over yet!
My Pokémon's HP is low... This could be a bit tight.
What just happened? I lost?!
We were having a heated discussion over Pokémon the way collectors do.
Knowledge alone isn't everything, you know...
I'm more knowledgeable than the rest when it comes to collecting. I have rare Pokémon!But a collector doesn't make a good battler, necessarily...
I'm a collector, and I'm proud of what I know about Pokémon.Would you like me to test your knowledge?
That's some knowledge you have there!
I don't like people who are more knowledgeable than me! Go away!
Welcome! This Pokémon is my pride and joy!
I take losses with an unusually big smile! Do you find that odd at all?
After a match, you should have some Moomoo Milk to quench your thirst!Just chug it right down!*glug glug*
It's not the end yet.
Are you saying something? You think you have me cornered?
Amazing! You're very good, aren't you?
*giggle*You found me! Of course I'll battle you!
Aww, boo! Look—you've beaten me!
*giggle*There's only our Gym Leader left. Go on—don't be afraid!
A forest inside a Gym... Shocking, isn't it?
I was going to beat you while you were still in a state of shock...
OK, the next Trainer is at the end, past two boulders.
My Grass-type Pokémon can dole out some serious special attacks.I won't let you win easily!
The more beautiful a flower, the faster it withers...
Oh, that's right... A hint about the next Trainer...In the middle of three trees. That's it for my hint.Good luck!
Even concealed, there is no hiding the aroma of flowers.
Just like your inability to conceal your abundant skill.
Your next opponent is under four flowers.
Hey! That there! That was a good move!
This is where it gets exciting!
Hunwah! It's gone and ended!How will I say this... I want more! I wanted to battle a lot more!
I've landed the most fish Pokémon in the world.I'm next!
Being number one in the world doesn't mean a thing...
I figure I got too wrapped up in fishing and neglected training.
I have mastery over the incredible power of water. You won't win!
But the kid wins anyway! I'm just bowled over!
The water rising and falling is tricky, but don't let it annoy you.If you lose sight of yourself, that's when you're set to lose.
I've traveled all over the globe while raising Pokémon.This is the Gym I've chosen. You'll find it a handful for sure!
You! You're a kind of top-class tough!
If you were to go around the world, I'm sure you'd meet tougher Pokémon.
Like the raging sea, I crash down and wash away everything before me! That's just how I roll!
That wave didn't even wash my hands...
I'm now becalmed like a waveless sea...
My body isn't the only thing I work on toughening up here.I also work on my Pokémon and my spirit!
Wow, Trainer! You just might be tougher than our Gym Leader!
Maybe I'll do like Wake—I mean, Crasher Wake—and wear the same kind of mask.
I want to become a strong Trainer like Crasher Wake!
*groan*You're too much.
Maybe I'll do like Wake—I mean, Crasher Wake—and use the same kinds of Pokémon.
Oh! But this isn't the end, my friend!
I'm in a bit of a bind, aren't I?
I shall admit defeat... You are much too strong.
We're the Karate Quads!I will strike a blow for love with my fist!Hiyah, looooooooove!
Argh! Crunched!
Your Pokémon sure are tough!But our Gym Leader Maylene will break you like a stack of bricks!
We're the Karate Quads!I will strike a blow for courage with my fist!Hiyah, couraaaaaaaaaaage!
I couldn't force my way to victory...
To overwhelm by force... That is my ideal beatdown style.It doesn't seem to work that way with Pokémon, however.
We're the Karate Quads!I will strike a blow for hope with my fist!Hiyah, hoooooooooooooope!
We came up short but not by much.
I'll have to redo my training, though.Maylene's gonna trample me again...
We're the Karate Quads!I will strike a blow for tears with my fist!Hiyah, teeeeeeaaaaaaaaars!
I'm so hungry, kid... I don't have any strength left...
I lost because I didn't eat enough pizza.No. Anything I say will sound like I'm making excuses.
Oh, heavens. What is this? Is this my final Pokémon?
Never give up—no matter what!
You are so fantastically strong. I know now why I have lost.
I've been to all sorts of places. That means I know tons of things!
Yeah, whatever. You can battle, too...
I'm gonna visit new places and find new Pokémon so I'll be a know-it-all!
Seriously, kid, why don't you answer the quiz properly? You could get to the Gym Leader without a problem! Waste of my time.Now I gotta knock you around a bit.
I kinda deserved that, didn't I? I gotta stop mouthing off like that...
I'll remember you and your shifty Pokémon, too.I'm watching you...
Ooh, ooh! You want to battle me? OK then,I'll do the best I can!
I squeezed out all my power... You're one impressive challenger.
Look at it this way: you can learn something from every battle.
Ehehe! You threw the quiz so you'd get to battle with me, right?
Don't you know how to take it easy or anything? Geesh!
Since you're here, you might as well take on every Trainer.
I'm not afraid of picnicking anywhere, so I've learned all sorts of things.
Your toughness... It's something new to me.
I've learned that Pokémon are fun 'cause everyone plays with 'em!
I study subjects like Pokémon and history...You know, all the important things!
Oh, what in the—? I didn't study enough?
You won because of Pokémon type matchups,cool tactics...You know, all sorts of reasons!
I've probably studied more about Pokémon than you.
Oh, you! I feel bad that I'm so angry!
I'm going over the reasons why I lost. That way,I'll win next time.
Don't you have a Pokétch? Or did you screw up deliberately?
Gwaaah! I was done in!
You'll have to turn back, though. This is a dead end.
I'm going to break the ice and bring out my last-resort Pokémon!
I can sense your will to win, but I promise you I'm not about to lose!
I must say, I've warmed up to you! I might even admire you a little.
It's t-too cold. I can't even feel my t-tongue.
This result... It's cold. Bitter cold.
The higher up you slide from, the more speed you'll have to smash those big snowballs.
My willpower was shaped and tempered by howling blizzards. I'll bring it to bear on you!
You weren't even fazed...
I've battled countless Trainers and many more Pokémon still.My spirit has been hardened from all the battles I have fared.
Is the Gym's trick floor making you a little hot under the collar?If you can't maintain your cool in battle, you'll freeze up.
You were surprisingly cool... At least I have my warm boots.
Your Pokémon <var> so caught up in the heat of battle. <var> so hot, <var> cool! Hahah!
Are you feeling the chill of fatigue?A good Trainer goes for the win no matter what their condition is!
That's right. A good Trainer will win, no matter what the situation may be.
The Trainer's feelings... The Pokémon's feelings...If they are one and the same, you will never lose.
Here it comes! Get ready for my trump card!
Shocking... I didn't see this coming!
You've got me beat. Your desire and the noble way your Pokémon battled for you...I even felt thrilled during our match. That was a very good battle.
Wow! I'm surprised you've come this far,but you'll have to turn back.There isn't any chance that you could ever beat me!
What makes your Pokémon so special?
As a challenger, you're one tough Trainer.
I'm not just looking for tough Trainers to battle.I've been battling here because I want to feel the rush!
Your power is so shocking, it's made me go numb.
I'm so glad there are Pokémon! There isn't much else that gives me the thrill that Pokémon do!
I want to win! I channel that desire through my guitar!I want to win! That desire makes my Pokémon a star!
We couldn't win... No encores for us...
The Trainer's desire to win! If you don't lose that,there's no limit on what you can become!
Spark!This is what our Gym Leader did to the Gym out of boredom!
Spark...
We were lacking energy...No, we lacked more than that. We didn't want the win enough.
Whether you're a Trainer or a guitarist, it takes dedication to improve your mad skills!
My skills seem to have let me down. I must have been out of tune!
The way you battle, I can feel the very heart of rock and roll.Tell me—are you maybe a fan of rocking out?
Look at the way I'm dressed. Can't you see that I'm hard-core?
I was being serious! Don't laugh at me! I mean it!
I dress this way so I can learn to think like an Electric-type Pokémon.Why don't you give it a try?
This is the toughest Gym in Sinnoh.That's why I'm here—to learn the best battle techniques around!
You're tough.
You just showed me that there's still lots I need to learn. The world of Pokémon is deep!
Can you make it to the Gym Leader?You sure now?
The gears spin round and round... I spin down and out...
Our Gym's trick walkways are sure to make your head spin!
My dragon Pokémon chose to become powerful here. They sure like it!
Your battle style...
It's been several years since I left the Dragon's Den.I've got to say, your Pokémon <var> in the top class for toughness.
My dragon Pokémon chose to remain here to become powerful.
There's something about you... You're not just anybody. I challenge you!
You're at a different level of expertise, for sure!
You've won countless times... That has made you very powerful.
There's something about you... You still remain extraordinary. I challenge you again!
I constantly analyze Pokémon and various battles on my laptop.
Things don't always work out according to my calculations...
I had a lot of fun battling with you, though.I wonder if I can analyze the battle data properly.I could use a rematch to get some additional data.
I analyzed our last battle on my laptop.
For some reason I was drawn here, and it is here that I met you...I want to know what all this means!
I see... So that's what it means...
I feel... I feel some sort of a mystic presence emanating from here...
Why have you come back to this spot? I want to know what all this means!
There is nothing here... And yet there is a power lurking...Were you drawn by it as well?
The power that slumbers within you... It is rather marvelous indeed...
A place where nothing else exists...A place such as that is better suited to awaken the power within.
See? You've come back again.There must be something that draws you here...
I don't care who you are—no one interferes with my treasure hunting!
My treasure! My Pokémon!
I heard there's an intriguing stone monument around, so I came running.
I'm still here...and still searching for treasures.However, a battle with you is a treasure I can't pass up!
A man standing alone, I face the sea and train.These fists were hewn in that way!
My training and my fists weren't enough to defeat you!
Argh! Instead of training myself, I should have trained my Pokémon!All I've been doing for the last year is staring out over the sea!
Ah, it's been a long time!I have been toughening my fists against the sea,just as before!
I've seen countless Trainers and even more Pokémon! So, what kind of a Trainer are you?
I see... Simply outstanding.
I've seen countless Trainers and even more Pokémon. You're a strong Trainer. Moreover,your heart is strong.
I am indeed a Veteran, but I don't use that as an excuse to slack off.I take pride in challenging those who have bested me before!
I'll let you join my fan club if you can beat me!
Ouch! Are you one of those crazy fans? You sure are rowdy!
Well, that's me and my Pokémon! Thank you for being such a fan!Just so you know, our latest single is called"Jigglin' Pokémon Wub"!
I've spotted a charismatic Trainer! We just might have a scoop here!
My camera's too heavy. I couldn't battle effectively...
The lively expressions on you and your Pokémon's faces make for some great TV!
Your spirit's giving off some seriously cool vibes...I can tell that you totally rock!
You beat me, but...I feel totally amped to jam harder!
Rock is about your spirit! Battling is about spirit,too! That's why battles rock! Rawk!
You're live on camera, but try to act natural, OK?
The camera is our witness! It's recorded our defeat...
I'd like to take that footage and have it broadcast worldwide.
Two Pokémon! If you had two Pokémon, we'd get a great shot here.
So, let's begin and find out what sort of a Trainer you are!
You have a superstar quality! You sure could become a celebrity!
I lost, but I'm totally thrilled! We just made some great TV!
Oh, no. What we really want to see is you in action with two Pokémon!
Are we all ready to have some fun? I sure am!Aren't you having fun?! Let's make it fun!OK?! Mwahahah!
Oh, no, no, no! Mwahahah?
A clown's makeup is a face that's crying while laughing. It defines what we do!
Po! Po! Pokémon!Heh, did you think I was a real Pokémon?
Pikachu!
I need to get more into the character of a Pokémon...
Join me in this on-the-spot report, live at the scene of a battle!
The media is the victim!
Interviews are about taking the initiative.
How is this madness possible? The two of us,losing to children?
This won't do... Time to retreat. This mission is a failure.
How insolent. Take a bite of this, child!
Losing to some child... Being careless cost me too much.
We are gathering Pokémon for an astonishing undertaking! Your meddling won't be tolerated!
I feel like I got meddled with...
Our astonishing undertaking is most certainly breathtaking. If you ever hope to see its glorious unveiling, then don't meddle with us!
Our objectives are incredible—too incredible for me to understand!I'll fight blindly to defend them, and your intrusion won't be forgiven!
What was I fighting for again?
What do you have against taking Pokémon from others? Look in any field or forest! Those things aren't exactly rare!
Sorry, deary! Team Galactic doesn't accept children as members!
B-but, deary, you're just a kid!
You wanted to go up? Well, why didn't you?
Let's see how good this Pokémon is! I stole it from some weak Trainer.
What is this?!
Wimpy little Pokémon...When I get promoted, I'll demand better stolen Pokémon.
Why, thank you!We love it when people come to us to donate their Pokémon!
What do you think you're doing?!
You can catch Pokémon anywhere. What's so special about them?Trainers that lose theirs should quit whining and catch some more!
This place is teeming with Unown... There has to be some meaning to this.The truth can be found. I'll start my search by battling you!
The search must continue!
I give up. I'm not going to rack my brain over the meaning of this place.
I can't explain it... Being here compels me to battle!
Hunh?! What was I just doing?!
Though they are gone, their desire to battle lives on? The spirits of Pokémon still linger?Is that what it is?
I need to shake off my sorrow... Please, battle with me!
My sorrow has deepened...
I won't ever forget the time I spent with my Pokémon...not even for a moment.
It makes no difference where we are. If you have Pokémon with you, I reckon you ought to battle.
You've got a lot of giddyup and go in you!
Over a long life, you'll be certain to have some sad farewells. But I reckon there are also some new beginnings.
Hahaha! I'm afraid y'all are no match for us with jus' one of them Pokémon!
My Pokémon is a lively one. Lemme show you!
Well! Aren't you the lively one!
Them graves here in Lost Tower... And right'n here, inside my heart... Those are the places where my Pokémon remain...
You haven't got yerself two Pokémon?
My Pokémon were taken from me...Team Galactic did it...Ever since, I've never forgiven their faces...
Gwaaaaaah!
I'm not doing my Pokémon any favors by ruining its memory like this...I can't be wallowing around forever. I gotta move on and turn the page.
I can't embarrass myself again. Not in front of my girlfriend!
Awww, jeez. That's a downer...
Coming here again brings back all kinds of memories of me and Nat.
You can't battle with us. Not with one Pokémon, anyway.
I don't want to look bad again. Not when my boyfriend is watching!
This makes me feel hollow inside...Oh so hollow...
The Pokémon that brought me and Mike together is buried here...
You do have at least two Pokémon, don't you?
Waaah! Ghost! Get away! Eek! Help me, team!
Hey... You're no ghost...
I had to come here because I lost a dare with some kids at school.The loser had to go to the top and bring back the TM for Strength.
Beating you would be my hundredth straight win!Here's to a fun battle!
You don't know how frustrating it is to lose now,after all that work!
I wish I could beat Maylene in Veilstone City one day...
Yeah, I like to camp! So what? Let's battle!
I should've just stuck to camping out here...
When I'm with my Pokémon, I can camp just about anywhere I want!
If we battle here, your Pokémon will become stronger, and so will mine.That's a good thing for both of us. What's not to like? Let's throw down!
You know, I would have really enjoyed a win there. Would've been real nice.
This mine's been abandoned, but now it's home to many Pokémon. I guess everything finds a place to call home someday...
Tough Pokémon... Tough Trainers...You tell me—where else can I find a place as good as this to train?
That was good. You've bonded well with your Pokémon.
Tough Pokémon... Tough Trainers...A strong spirit and a tight bond... There is so much to train for.
I'll pound the fear of my fists into you all karate style, punk!
I'm so sorry... I got a bit mouthy there, didn't I?
So, I'm gonna try and shatter steel!I wonder how many more years it would take for me to do that?
Every good hiker gets a boost of energy when surrounded by boulders!Wrooooar! Coming at you! Let me blow off some steam!
Whew... I think I've calmed down now...
If it's called a mountain, you can be sure I'll be climbing it.Even if it's a mountain of food, I'll still be stickin'my flag on top!
When you're up in the mountains, a battle'd do for a proper greeting!

Actually, when you're up in the mountains,a simple hi'd do if you walk past someone.Oh, and this isn't the mountains.
May we have a battle, please?It will be something to lighten up this boring picnic with.
We're not going to win if we play around like that...
I'm going home to play with my Pokémon!
The working-class hero says hi!
The working-class hero waves bye...
I used to work here a long time ago, before it shut down. I worked at the ironworks near Floaroma Town, too.You might say I'm drawn to iron as if by magnet!
While I'm making sure the lifts are safe, I'll focus on a battle with you!
A-OK! Looks safe to me! Not a problem in sight!
I routinely check the lifts here. You can be sure of their safety!
Hey! This is no playground! If you're gonna play,battle me!
You played me like an amateur!
They were going to close this place up so no one could get in. But they left it open so people and Pokémon can get together here.
The Canalave Gym folks use this place as their training grounds.
Maybe I should head to the Gym and work out there...
Roark spent his childhood playing here, I think...
Humph! You're lost, aren't you? I'll guide you if you can beat me.
I said I'm going to win!
I'm not lost, I tell you! I'm camping!That's my story!
Huh? Are you lost, too? No? It doesn't matter.Let's have a quick Pokémon battle!
Not fair! We're not on the same level!
I got separated from my friends... I've got my Pokémon with me, so I'm OK, but...
You look like you might just have the Pokémon I've been looking for!
You didn't have a single Pokémon I wanted...You're no collector!
I'm very picky, so I want to collect every Pokémon without anyone's help....I do have friends, though. No, seriously! I do!
In deep tunnels and caves, there're a couple things you're sure to see.Zubat and Ruin Maniacs!
Your awesome power... It's mystifying.
I've scoured every inch of this place... Most of it while I was lost.Anyway, if there's one thing I can say, this place can't be called ruins!
Hush now, lost little Pokémon. Don't you cry.I'm here to take care of you!
*sniffle*Wh-who's crying now?
Speaking of crying, I'm positive I heard crying from deeper in the cave.
Look! A Trainer lost in Wayward Cave!
I strayed from the battle plan!
Me? No, I'm not lost. I live here!
Wandering around, I got hungry, so I ate some wild mushrooms... They gave me gas, and now I can't stop burping! Bluurrf!
Bleff! Hurk! I think...I'm getting better...
I hear there's a Pokémon that has mushrooms growing on its back.Not around here—somewhere far away. I wonder if the mushrooms taste any good?
Where am I? Am I lost? Who are you?Are you a Pokémon Trainer?
OK, so we're both Trainers. That's a start, right?
I just wanted to have a picnic under Cycling Road. I didn't think I would get lost in a place like this...
What every good picnic needs is a cute setting,good food, and a fun battle!
That wasn't any fun for me!
Why have a picnic here? I don't know.There's no deep meaning to it.
Did you come to play, too? Wanna play battle with me?
You were just toying with me!
I'm playing hide-and-seek here. I like some underground tag, too.
The sharp vision of my bird Pokémon will see through your weaknesses!
Don't you have an Achilles' heel?
I want to become stronger but only with my favorite Pokémon.
Learning how to manage tough Pokémon is the shortcut to getting tough.
I lost? But how is that possible?!
Being able to manage any kind of Pokémon...I suppose that makes a good Trainer.
Being this tough isn't good enough. You have to look cool while doing it.Mastering that makes you an ace!
Made me look bad...
I battled the best I could. I wasn't uncool in losing! ...Right?
I want my Pokémon to get a taste of the sweetness that is victory.I can't afford to lose this one!
This defeat has the tang of my bitter tears...
I feel sorry for my hungry Pokémon...Sorry, team. I'll get tougher so you can feast on the taste of victory...
I will win. I am sure of it. Therefore, you will lose!
But... This isn't possible!
You didn't win! I just lost! Oh, whatever. It's the same thing...
Let me see what you got there, kid. I could give you some advice.
You got way too much!
Well, I don't have any advice for someone as tough as you!
Now we shall have a battle, and from it will emerge one loser...
Oh!
I can use psychic powers, but battling isn't so simple... It takes much more to win!
A battle is a clash of willpower!The one who wants the win the most will emerge the victor!
But...I thought I could win!
Psychic power...It's hard to put faith in something that you can't see...
Allow me to demonstrate how a true psychic conducts a battle!
Did I get to show you anything? Anything at all?
How do I use my psychic powers?I never use them for dishonest ends. I also never do any good deeds...
I see it! I see a victory for me!
The future...is different! Why?!
Your efforts have altered the very path of the future!
I trained all of my gnarly Pokémon at the Fighting Dojo in Kanto!
Totally done for!
We're gonna go ahead and leave... You know,go train elsewhere.
Judo chop! Pokémon battle!
Wrroar! Judo chop defeated!
I'll forget that we lost!Wait—if I did that, we'd never learn from our mistakes...
What it means to battle... Its joys, its sorrows...I've experienced it all!
My sorrow deepens...
You may be a child, but you've taught me a whole lot. I thank you humbly.
I'll wheel out some wicked Pokémon and even wickeder moves!
All I can manage now is to wheeze out a few meek sighs...
I don't see what my age has to do with playing with Pokémon, frankly.
I let my bird Pokémon carry me to wherever.And so, here I am!
Sheesh... I arrive in a new place and it turns out to be the Battle Zone...
I was born in the Hoenn region. I've only just recently flown here.
I let my bird Pokémon do as they wish. And so,we train here daily!
My Pokémon grew up in the arms of Mother Nature. They're tough!
How could you be tougher than Mother Nature?
Most of the time, my Pokémon return to their Poké Balls right away.But sometimes, they just fall asleep on top of my head. That gets messy.
The desire to win... That should be evident in every Trainer!
The potential of dragon Pokémon puts them at the top of my list!
Potential doesn't mean I can win...
A Dragon Tamer Champion... I'll need to train so much more to even come close to coming close...
I cranked up my dragon Pokémon's potential!I've been looking forward to seeing you again!
What my Pokémon and I most want: victory!
Arrrgh! My Gyarados...
I don't ever want to put my Pokémon through that again...It got humiliated because I wasn't good enough...
You've beaten us before, but we won't make the same mistake!
Dragon Pokémon are sacred beings... That's what my master taught me.And now I'll prove it to you!
Not good enough! We're still not strong enough!
It's not good enough for a Pokémon to just be tough. It's not good enough for a Trainer to just work hard. Both have to grow together!
This time, I'll show you how brilliantly I work with my Pokémon partner!
How do you do? I'm a Dragon Tamer. What say we compare our Pokémon by means of a battle?
Oops! How very silly of me!
Well, there seems to be an image associated with Dragon Tamers. But personally, I'm really laid back and easygoing, you know?I figure there's a whole lot of other things I need to worry about first.
Heya, how do you do again? What say we let our Pokémon duke it out in another battle?
There is something missing in the way I battle...I've come here to find it.
I see it now... I know what I lack.
It's been a privilege to have battled with you.I learned an invaluable lesson from you today.
I've discovered what's missing from my battles—Have you discovered what's missing from yours?
I've got the urge to battle with you. I hope you're willing to oblige!
I shouldn't have paid attention to my urge...
So long as my partner's alongside me, I'm willing to take on the world!
The urge to battle you again has struck me.Want to humor me?
Have you any knowledge of levels or the stats of Pokémon? Well, I do!
Hmm. I like how you attack.
Pokémon levels and stats... Who cares about that stuff?Winning is what's important.Numbers aren't everything.
Pokémon battles aren't decided by numbers.The decisive factor is the bond you share with your Pokémon!
Welcome to my Pokémon show!
Did you enjoy the show? Super fabulous,wasn't it?
I'll be happy to battle you again! Let's battle again sometime, yeah?
Welcome to my new Pokémon show!
My team's been trained through and through!You'll shake when you see how tough they are!
I'm sh-sh-shaking all over...
I fed my gang Protein, Carbos... You name it,I pumped 'em full of it.
Hey, you're that Trainer who left me all shook up!Uh-huh!This time, it's my turn to leave you shaking all over!
My partner and I have come this far. Let me show you how much it's grown!
It needs to grow more?!
My Pokémon... It's actually the very first friend that I've ever had.
When I close my eyes, I'm taken back to that time we lost to you.My partner's grown even more since then.I'll prove it to you!
Worthy opponents... The search for them drives me to travel far.
I've certainly found a tough adversary in you...
How much you believe in your Pokémon—that's a critical factor in how a battle will turn out.
We've faced many challengers since we met,but they were all weak...I relish the tough resistance that only you can provide!
Please don't hold anything back.
Hmm...
I feel invigorated from that battle, even though we lost. After all, we gave it everything we had.
Hello again! Please don't hold anything back—just like before.
You're willing to battle? Let me see what kind of Pokémon you have.
Your love of Pokémon really shows!
I grew up together with my team, right from my childhood.All our memories, we've always shared them.
Oh, hi, we meet again. May I see what you've done with your Pokémon?
The world is huge, and there are so many different Pokémon!What kinds of Pokémon are with you? Please,I want to have a look!
Wow, there really are Pokémon that wonderful!
There is always something to like about any Pokémon.It's so hard to decide which ones I should raise.
If I'm having trouble deciding, I go with my favorites!
What sort of moves have you taught? That tells me how good you are!
Yowch!
I heard that somewhere, there's someone who teaches Pokémon moves.
Have you taught your team any new moves since last time?
When eyes meet... That's when a battle starts!
You won't let me win?
I suddenly remembered what it was like when I had my first battle. I wonder why that would be?
When eyes meet... That's when a battle starts!That's what makes us Trainers!
You're going to win! That's the future I saw!
What I saw in the future turned out to be true...
I lost, but my vision of the future came true...
You're going to win again! That's the future I saw!
Right after this, you will send out Pokémon to battle me!
Right after this, I have to pay out your prize money...
What will happen to you after this? Why don't you do just as you like? It would be more fun that way.
Right after this, you will hurl a Poké Ball in an astonishingly cool way!
My quest for power brought me here. It was beneath the desert sand that I toughened my body and soul.Accept my challenge! Uraah!
My spirit is broken...
I thought I couldn't win before it became a fact...I've let down my Pokémon... They go to battle with faith in their Trainer...
This time—this time I will win! My spirit is renewed and strong!
I have meditated under a waterfall to temper my spirit. Allow me to demonstrate its strength!
Ha-choo! *sniffle*
All that time under the waterfall... Seems I've caught a cold.
Since the day I lost to you, I've meditated under a waterfall!
People! Nature! Pokémon! Harmony is essential!
You're A-OK!
Protecting Pokémon and nature. Think of what that means.
Do you remember my slogan?People! Nature! Pokémon!That's right. Harmony is essential!
I work to protect beautiful, natural environments.My Pokémon are my constant companions while I work.
Oh my gosh! My poor Pokémon!
Everyone can do their part to keep nature clean.It doesn't take much.
I'm on patrol in pristine nature with my Pokémon like usual.Come to think of it, you're always with Pokémon, too.
We go on patrol to make sure there's nothing strange going on. And occasionally, we battle!
Thanks much!
You know that Pokémon Ability, Pickup? I think that's a good way of keeping the environment clean of litter.
Patrols day in and day out! And the occasional battle!
In the embrace of Mother Nature, people and Pokémon grow strong!
My, you are tough.
You can grow strong anywhere. It doesn't matter where you are.
By battling tough opponents, both people and Pokémon grow tough!
We've grown strong together in nature and in the concrete jungle.We make everywhere we go our playground!
You're fantastically tough, aren't you?!
Look around you at this wildly contorted terrain.It's no wonder that Pokémon would grow tough in a place like this.
I think I'm pretty tough, but so are you and your Pokémon.Let's have a battle to see who is the toughest!
Are you getting worn out from all the running you've done?
You're not tired at all?!
The world is full of Pokémon and all sorts of Trainers.
What do you think of the Battle Zone?You've met so many Pokémon... I've got to battle you again!
A Trainer riding a Pokémon! I like that!We've gotta battle!
Awesome! You're a real wild child!
Riding the waves on a Pokémon's back...Yeah, that's something to talk about, all right.
Yo, Pokémon-riding Trainer! How about a rematch?
Check out my physique! The rough seas sculpted this awesome body!
Muscles I have plenty of... But let's not talk about strength.
You've got wild Pokémon using a hidden move for you... I find that really moving.
The rough seas here almost drowned—wait, no,shaped my physique! See how buff it is!
Check out my dynamic form! Victory is assured!
Oh. That's how it is.
Being a good swimmer doesn't make me any better as a Trainer...
Hi! You're that kid who's great with Pokémon!I'll battle with an even more dynamic form than before! Watch me now!
My Pokémon and I are pumped up and ready to go all out!
Our muscles are deflating...
Overwhelm with our dazzling physiques!That was our game plan...
Me and my Pokémon are pumped up! See, our muscles are twitching!
People keep coming to us for battles. I really don't know why! Teehee!
OK, we lost.
I wanted to be alone, but after swatting away so many immature boys...Well, my Pokémon grew tough without me really even trying.
People still keep coming to us for battles! Why?!
Are your Pokémon growing?
Maybe they're too grown up!
I've grown with my Pokémon, too. We're better swimmers now than ever!
Did your Pokémon grow any more?Hmm? My Pokémon? Mine are doing awesome!
I'm a mermaid who drifts among the waves...But I'm also a playful girl who likes to have fun with Pokémon!
Losing brings tears to my eyes...
A mermaid's tears are so salty...
I remain a mermaid who drifts among the waves...But I'm also a playful girl who likes to have fun with Pokémon!
I want to be with my Water Pokémon.That's why I swim.
*glub glub*I'm going down!
Everyone I know says they have to train harder and more often. I thought so too, but I find it hard to get that serious about it.Being with my Pokémon puts me in a mellow mood, I guess.
I want to be with my Water Pokémon.That's why I want to be stronger!
With one mighty flap, my birds blow away the embers of aggression!
We failed to get off the ground...
The hidden move Fly isn't useful inside caves.It's such a shame.
Dragons and a fiery mountain... It's a totally classic setup!
Losing isn't a happy occasion...
My Pokémon seem to like it here a lot.
Are you seeking the Legendary Pokémon here,too? Let's battle, then!
I've got nothing left...
The Legendary Pokémon that sleeps deep in a volcano... Could it be a dragon Pokémon?
What it means to win battles—that is what I seek.Teach me if you will!
I grow less certain still...
Perhaps there is no meaning to victory, but still I will battle! That is what makes me a Trainer!
Being with Pokémon makes me happy. And when we win, I feel happier still!
We're still happy even when we lose!
Raising Pokémon to the extremes... Having fun with Pokémon...People should do whatever makes them happy.That's what I think!
I was born in Floaroma Town. I'm sure thrilled to be here.It took a long time to get here. We're not going to lose again!
We went down... We couldn't stick it out...
You can level all you want, but that won't guarantee you any wins.But we keep trying to get better. That's what makes us Trainers.
The Trainers and Pokémon that gather here aren't pushovers. They all have tricks up their sleeves!
You're not a Trainer that can be taken lightly!
The Pokémon you'll meet here won't make it easy for you to move onward.
You've come all this way for Pokémon? You must be dedicated.
Your dedication won out.
The Pokémon here must battle each other all the time. That would explain why they are so strong.
My Pokémon and I are pretty nice, but not when it comes to a battle!
I couldn't unleash the real me...
When you're raising Pokémon, you need to be both firm and gentle.
I came here after winning my way through the Battle Tower!
But I had a win streak going...
Train more at the Battle Tower... That's what I'll do.
We're all good to go! We just have to battle now!
Aww... I'm out of useful items!
We came completely unprepared for this little adventure...
I had a revelation this morning. I knew that I would have a wonderful encounter here today.
There's nothing wonderful about this!
Is my sense of premonition nothing to write home about?
I'll use my mystifying psychic powers to pulverize you!
That's what I get for making idle claims...
Psychic power is a mystery that defies explanation. But if everything could be explained, it would be a boring world.
My Pokémon can destroy anything. And you think you can win?!
We weren't up to the task!
Even though my team could break bricks and shatter boulders, they failed to dent your spirits!
Howdy! I'm crazy for karate! Hear the howl of my iron fists!
Losing made it clear to me—you're crazy about Pokémon!
I love seeing people who love Pokémon more than anything!
What do you expect to achieve here? I'll be the one to make that call!
You've earned the right to be here—both you and your Pokémon.
You may find it odd, but the stink of sulfur from the volcanic gas is what draws me here.
I just got worked over! And by a kid, no less...
Ugh! Again and again...
It is our mission to stall you. Sorry, but we gotta do our job.
Losing was a part of my job, too... I feel better by saying that.
We won't allow anyone to stop us from gathering the three Pokémon from the three lakes.
In order for us to bring peace to the world,we must control it!
You're too young to understand.
Our boss always had plans for the three lakes.While you were blissfully ignorant, our work went ahead...
I'll knock your Pokémon into orbit!
My mind is going orbital!
The Pokémon here has already been taken to our HQ in Veilstone City.It's far too late for a child like you to make any difference.
If this mission is successful, we will get a nice bonus.
I'm heartbroken...
I want Team Galactic to become powerful.That is all I want.
You, my friend, are tough! I can see why you defy us so...
We set off the Galactic Bomb! Its blast force was phenomenal!
Your Pokémon attack with phenomenal power...
So, you're tough. Big deal. What do you think you can accomplish?There's one of you up against the entirety of Team Galactic.By now, another crew should be on their way to Lake Verity near that puny little Twinleaf Town!
On behalf of our boss, I'll punish you for defying Team Galactic!
Grr... I'm the one who got punished in the end...
We're Team Galactic! The number one syndicate in the world!To defy us is to defy the universe!
...Would you like to join the Magikarp and flop around in the mud?
...Overwhelming!
I played you for a child, and paid a stiff price for my arrogance...However, you're much too late.Team Galactic has already found the sunken island under the lake—And the Pokémon that slumbers there?Well, where do you think it is now?
You're tough, kid! But I still pity the likes of you.
Well, what have we here? A Trainer who's lost their way?
You're lost but you won! That burns me up to 11!
You barged right into our HQ? You must not know what fear is, kid!
You're the first intruder we've had in our HQ!
Oh, sure. Why don't you just get all cocky about it!
Without our special card key, you're not going to get very far.Well, non-Team Galactic member? What's your next move?
Who do you think you are, desecrating the halls of our HQ?!
A tough little Trainer is what you are...
We get around in Galactic HQ by a system of round warp panels.Do you think you will ever learn the way they connect? Good luck!
People like you just don't understand why we do what we do.You don't understand Team Galactic, so why is it that you defy us?!
I couldn't understand the battle or your toughness...
I went out of my way to deliver my cool lines before the battle!You should've let me win! Get a grip on reality, already!
I'm, like, this close to getting my promotion to commander.I'll impress our great boss by making you my newest trophy!
...I wish this never happened.
Losing sets me back to square one...I'll probably get bumped down to the gruntiest of the grunts... Humph!
I smell an intruder!
Oh, it was just my Pokémon that stunk...
We don't stink! We're on the cutting edge of stuff!
Having fun scampering around our HQ,you sneaky intruder?Your trailblazing will go out in a blaze of glory right now!
Your trailblazing streak lives on!
So what, you have momentum... It's too late.The experiment's done!
You should be tired out by now. It's Team Galactic's turn to shine!
What? I don't get it. What's your rush?
Pokémon are that important to you? Is that what this is all about?
Are you enjoying your unescorted, unauthorized,and unsettling tour of Team Galactic HQ?
Let me do what I want!
It doesn't matter what happens to the Team Galactic HQ building.Soon, all will belong to Team Galactic!
Hey there, little Trainer! You're famous among Team Galactic.The order has been issued—we get a promotion if we put you down!
I just blew my promotion...
What's so special about you anyway?You're just like any other little kid Trainer anywhere else!
Our time has come! It's Team Galactic's time now!
When's it gonna be my turn...
It's too late!No amount of desperation from a kid like you will make a difference!
Our time will come... A time for only us!I'm going to turn back your time to a time before Pokémon!
Gyah!
You can struggle all you want, but you can't stop Team Galactic alone!It doesn't matter how many Pokémon you try to use as your tools!
Team Galactic is all-powerful!Only a fool would show defiance to the mighty might of Team Galactic!
Not standing up to the mighty is foolish,you say...?
It doesn't matter if you're an adult or a kid if you have Pokémon.Pokémon are the equalizers. I should have realized sooner...
I can't believe you chased me here...OK, let's see how tough you are.
Where do you get that power?!
Mount Coronet...I might only be a grunt, but even I can tell it has a weird energy!
This is our final operation. No one will interfere!
You turned the tables on me! I call interference...
The closer you are to the peak, the closer you are to space!Soon, Team Galactic will... Uh... Team Galactic will achieve greatness!
Team Galactic will take control of everything!You can try all you want, but you can't do anything alone!
All you gave me was the taste of defeat...
...Is our boss about to ditch us and claim everything for himself?
We grunts have been assigned two noble jobs—One, to ensure the success of our operation at the summit!And two, to utterly destroy anyone who dares interfere!
I don't accept this! I will not accept this!
Join Team Galactic and then abide by our rules.That would solve all our problems!
Say, listen, do you realize you're breaking hearts by being successful?It's your fault that Team Galactic members are in so much pain...
See? You've left me brokenhearted, too...
One person's joy is another person's sorrow...Everyone should be happy and laughing?How ridiculous!Team Galactic should be doing all the laughing!
Our boss is going to do something huge at the summit.But here I am dealing with some pesky intruder...You're spoiling the atmosphere. You can lose quickly, right?
You're not supposed to work me over like that.
All my excitement's gone now...This whole Mount Coronet trip is too rough,long, and draining...
You've worked so hard to get here. You should be proud of yourself!And now, I'll send you packing with only that happy thought!
Wha— How dare you! That's how you respond to my generosity?
We couldn't stop you... We'll be discarded as useless...Our boss is ruthless that way...
Oh yeah? I'll show you something wicked, too!
What the—? We're in trouble?! Well, I won't give up so easily!
What just happened?! You're telling me I lost?!
Oh yeah? I'll show you something wicked, too!
What the—? We're in trouble?! Well, I won't give up so easily!
What just happened?! You're telling me I lost?!
Oh yeah? I'll show you something wicked, too!
What the—? We're in trouble?! Well, I won't give up so easily!
What just happened?! You're telling me I lost?!
Yeah, I can tell you raised your Pokémon to be tough!
What just happened?! You're telling me I lost?!
Yeah, I can tell you raised your Pokémon to be tough!
What just happened?! You're telling me I lost?!
Yeah, I can tell you raised your Pokémon to be tough!
What just happened?! You're telling me I lost?!
We've gotten out of tighter spots than this plenty of times before!
We're not done yet! Neither me nor my Pokémon have given up!
What just happened?! You're telling me I lost?!
We've gotten out of tighter spots than this plenty of times before!
We're not done yet! Neither me nor my Pokémon have given up!
What just happened?! You're telling me I lost?!
We've gotten out of tighter spots than this plenty of times before!
We're not done yet! Neither me nor my Pokémon have given up!
What just happened?! You're telling me I lost?!
I fully believe in this last one. I have no reason to freak out.
We're not finished yet! We'll get out of this spot because we're so tight!
What just went down?! My team still needs raising?!
I fully believe in this last one. I have no reason to freak out.
We're not finished yet! We'll get out of this spot because we're so tight!
What just went down?! My team still needs raising?!
I fully believe in this last one. I have no reason to freak out.
We're not finished yet! We'll get out of this spot because we're so tight!
What just went down?! My team still needs raising?!
Not yet! Your first Pokémon League victory doesn't come easily, kid!
I will now concede defeat.But I think you came to see how great Bug-type Pokémon can be.I hope you also realized what you're up against in the Pokémon League.Battling is a deep and complex affair...
Dear child, don't assume for an instant that you've won.
Well! Dear child, I must say, that was most impressive.Your Pokémon believed in you and did their best to earn you the win.Even though I've lost, I find myself with this silly grin!
I can feel your determination. Your will is overpowering me!
This situation is heating up! I'm blazing now!
Whoa!I wasn't expecting this!I wasn't looking down on you, but I didn't think for a second that I'd lose!This is fantastic! You and your Pokémon are inspiring!
Hmm... Now what should I do...
I see...You getting past the three before me was no fluke. Your power is real.
I can't remember the last time I was put in a corner like this!
I won't let this end yet! This match is too fun to let it end this easily!
Just a few minutes ago, you were the most powerful challenger.And just now, you became the most powerful of all the Trainers.You are now our newest Champion!
Did you get better since we met? I... Well, here,just look!
Too strong! Too strong!
Did you get better since we met? I... Well, here,just look!
Too strong! Too strong!
Did you get better since we met? I... Well, here,just look!
Too strong! Too strong!
I'm always with my Pokémon.Actually, you're always with your Pokémon too,aren't you?
I'm totally bummed out again...
I'm always with my Pokémon.Actually, you're always with your Pokémon too,aren't you?
I'm super bummed out now...
I'm always with my Pokémon.Actually, you're always with your Pokémon too,aren't you?
I'm so beyond bummed out now...
I got a nifty-keen Gym Badge from the Gym Leader in Oreburgh City!...Did I show you already?
Oh, I lost! Lalala!
I got a nifty-keen Gym Badge from the Gym Leader in Oreburgh City!...Did I show you already?
Oh, I lost! Lalala!
I got a nifty-keen Gym Badge from the Gym Leader in Oreburgh City!...Did I show you already?
Oh, I lost! Lalala!
Oh, thank you for that last battle.May I please trouble you for another one?
Oh... You're so strong...
Oh, thank you for that last battle.May I please trouble you for another one?
Oh... You're so strong...

Your heart burns as hot as mine!
This isn't like last time. See how much I've trained since then!
Whew... You're overtrained for me.

Super outdoor fishing! Shouting still doesn't help!
Gwaaah! This is hurting!
Rock 'n' roll! We'll beat it out again: our rhythm of battle!
Can you hear it? That's my guitar, weeping...
Last time, you beat me before I had a chance to show you my skill.This time, I'll show you why they consider me an ace!
I'm burning with jealousy over your raw talent!
Ace Trainers always work to improve their natural-born talents.
I see... I have to concede defeat.
Listen—did you go to Ramanas Park? What was it like? What was it like?
You're one enthusiastic Trainer.
Hi, traveler! I've forgotten your name, but we've battled before, haven't we?
You sure showed me up.
Oh, we'll ride upon the sea,in a boat, just you and me! ♪ That's the way of the sailor! Way of the sailor. ♪ You sing, too!

I've been training here in hopes of going to the Pokémon League.
I'm shocked... No, really, I am.
I've decided! If I finally beat you, I'm headed for the Pokémon League!
*blblblblugh*
It's me again! The harsh sea here should have toughened me up more!
The world remains as harsh as ever...
It doesn't matter how long it takes—I'm going to the Pokémon League!
Th-this is so hard...
How much stronger have your Pokémon become?Let me check 'em out, OK?
I've had my fill...
My dragon Pokémon chose to remain here to become powerful.
Your battle style...
Why have you come back to this spot? I want to know what all this means!
I see... So that's what it means...
See? You've come back again.There must be something that draws you here...
The power that slumbers within you... It is rather marvelous indeed...
I am indeed a Veteran, but I don't use that as an excuse to slack off.I take pride in challenging those who have bested me before!
I see... Simply outstanding.
I let my bird Pokémon do as they wish. And so,we train here daily!
Sheesh... I arrive in a new place and it turns out to be the Battle Zone...
I've cranked up my dragon Pokémon's abilities!I've been looking forward to seeing you again!
Raising abilities alone doesn't mean I can win either...
I've discovered what's missing from my battles—Have you discovered what's missing from yours?
I see it now... I know what I lack.
The urge to battle you again has struck me.Want to humor me?
I shouldn't have paid attention to my urge...
We've faced many challengers since we met,but they were all weak...I relish the tough resistance that only you can provide!
I've certainly found a tough adversary in you...
Hello again! Please don't hold anything back—just like before.
Hmm...
You're going to win again! That's the future I saw!
What I saw in the future turned out to be true...
Right after this, you will hurl a Poké Ball in an astonishingly cool way!
Right after this, I have to pay out your prize money...
This time—this time I will win! My spirit is renewed and strong!
My spirit is broken...
Do you remember my slogan?People! Nature! Pokémon!That's right. Harmony is essential!
You're A-OK!
By battling tough opponents, both people and Pokémon grow tough!
My, you are tough.
Yo, Pokémon-riding Trainer! How about a rematch?
Awesome! You're a real wild child!
People still keep coming to us for battles! Why?!
OK, we lost.
Yeah, like I'm really supposed to win with a Pokémon like this...
We spend all our time battling in the blizzards of Snowpoint City.We'll show you how it's toughened us up!
What's with your toughness?!
You've battled all over, you say? That makes you tough, perhaps.
I've only been involved with Pokémon for a short time.I managed to get this far because skilled friends toughened me up!
I can't believe how tough you are!
If you have wonderful friends, there is no limit to how far you can go.
Our mission is to implement our operations without question.It is all for the new world order that our boss will lead!
This won't go unpunished...
I'm quite prepared to do anything to be promoted.One day, and soon, you will learn the true might of Team Galactic!
I won't let you disrupt our research! This is for Team Galactic!
I got whipped... I look pathetic...
Our boss is a scientific genius!He will make the power of Legendary Pokémon his own!
Hey, now! Our HQ is a state-of-the-art facility!A snot-nosed kid like you ought to keep your dirty hands to yourself!
You and your Pokémon weren't part of my calculations...
Our boss is trying to create an entirely new world.A world only for us! For Team Galactic!
Bika bikabika! Pigachu!
Pikachu...
Pika...I'll need a lot more practice to become a real Pikachu...
I work at a red-hot foundry. Watch out,I'm on fire!
I burned out...
I toughened up my muscles from honest work.Pokémon have nothing on me!
Well! It's not often we get a visitor like you to the ironworks!Let's mark the occasion with a battle!
Fire!
The floor panels move automatically.We're pretty proud of them here!
Are you maybe getting annoyed by where the floor panels take you?
I'm going down in flames!
The sweat of a working man is beautiful to behold...There is also beauty in the tears wept from defeat...
The toughest of all the grunts! That was me...
Arrgh! I let some little kid beat me!
Sheesh... I should have done the fighting myself.
Humph! You've toughened up. But you're no match for our boss.
Done in by two kids?! This isn't right!
I should have kept my head down and just watched our warehouse...
Fweh... If I didn't run...I could've...battled harder...
My last Pokémon.
I see... I may lose if this pace continues...
Interesting. And quite curious.
I admit that you have pushed me to this extreme.
This... This cannot be! It's not possible that I lose!
I won't accept this! The power spoken of in mythology...I didn't just make it obey me, I made it my own!
I feel like crying... This is so sad...
What a tough combination! I can't believe it!
Oh, yeah? When the going gets tough,my Pokémon get tougher!
What just went down?! You're telling me I lost again?!
Oh, yeah? When the going gets tough,my Pokémon get tougher!

If I battle now, won't it mess up my usual pace?
My pace is completely off...
If I battle now, won't it mess up my usual pace?

Here comes my trump card! Witness the true strength of Rock types!
No way! Not yet! Not giving up!
Wh-what? It can't be! Even that wasn't enough?
Don't you think it's natural to save your best for last?
This is where the battle really begins!
Wow! You've totally bested me!
Oh? Could this really be my last?
Fight! You can do it!
Bravo!
Ah! This is an awful lot of pressure!
My victory will be all the more meaningful when I get out of this tight spot!
I admit defeat...
Well done indeed! Not many can capsize me!
Waves of excitement are crashing over me!
What's this? It seems I've run out of Pokémon!
What, you think you've got me cornered?
It's not over! Steel only gets stronger with every hit it takes!
Hmm! That was an impressive battle!
OK, it's time to focus!
I worked hard to get this far! There's no way I'm giving up now!
You sure are impressive—you even made me lose my focus!
Fantastic! I'm getting jolts of excitement from this battle!
The harder I'm pressed, the more fun I have!I'm coming at you with full power!
Hahahahahah! A total loss... I feel so refreshed!

Hmm! My sturdy Pokémon, defeated!
Look, Cheryl! I can see the exit!
Oh? Mira, don't you think that was easier than expected?
Huh? How do we find the exit?
We really just want to get to the exit...
Ohohoho!Ohohoho!
Well, what did you think of that? That's the power of a great duo!
We have lost.
Oof...
A kid's just a kid, after all...
Humph. That's all you've got?
Gah! You're tough, kid.
Humph! You're not too bad, I suppose...
We did it, Maylene! Our focus came out on top!
I'm so hungry... Oh, no, I didn't say anything!
You really are great! I can't help but respect you even more!
*gurgle*
Whatever you've done to prepare for this,you must have been doing it right!
You're the best, just the way you are...
I guess we should have prepared more...
Thanks for the battle.
Yeah! I'm one step ahead of you!
Yeah! I really am the greatest Trainer ever!
Ahahaha! You still have some learning to do.
Whoops! You got me!
Ahahaha! Well done indeed!
Didn't quite get your flames going hot enough, eh?
I wasn't exactly bored, but that battle was definitely missing something.
That was a raging hot battle!
What an electrifying battle. I can't get enough!
So...how does it feel to lose?
Such a waste of my time... Is that really the best you can do?
That can't be! I lost?!
How? How?! HOW?!
I won! I finally defeated <var>!It was me... I did it... which means... I'm the greatest Pokémon Trainer in the world!
That was a close one, and a fantastic Pokémon battle!I know you'll become even more skilled.Please come and challenge me again!
Wha—? This is a joke, right? This can't be happening!
Spectacular! Truly spectacular!
Yup, that's the power of Rock-type Pokémon!
Wh-what? That can't be! My buffed-up Pokémon!
Didja see that? Grass-type Pokémon really grow up strong and healthy!
That's it, then! I lost!
I guess strength can be rather short-lived!
Um... It seems I've lost.
Gwahahaha! All my training on Iron Island has paid off!
Hmm! My sturdy Pokémon, defeated!
Eheheh! Dignified enough for you?
You really are mighty! Yup, Candice lost!
Ohohoho!Ohohoho!
Oh! I missed a step!
All right. That's got my heart rate steady again.
Outstanding! I acknowledge your electrifying win!
Yes! That's a W-I-N...for Crasher Wake!
WHAAAT?! I think it's fair to say that you absolutely demolished me!
An admirable attempt! I could feel your passion for battle. Let's do this again sometime!
That was excellent. You have a beautiful way of battling!
A fierce bout that was!I can definitely tell that you're serious about this.Come back and try again any time!
A magnificent bout that was! You really are the pinnacle of Trainers!
Not yet! We'll keep struggling till the very end!
A bug Pokémon's life force is nothing to sneer at!
Guess I was still one step behind... You've won.
I lost completely. But I think you've come to realize how great bug Pokémon can be.
Ahahaha! Victory may be in sight, but take care not to lose your footing!
No matter where you stand, you can always count on the ground beneath your feet.
That was quite something. Your youth gives you a confidence in battle that can't be shaken.
I'm very impressed. Your strength shook me like a tremor from the earth itself.
Hey! I'm about to go full throttle!
Things are getting so hot, I can see heat waves!
Incredible! Your moves are so hot, they make mine look lukewarm!
Unbelievable! What burning passion!You're like the sun to your own solar system,<var>!
Hmm... How might I turn this situation to my advantage?
Here comes my masterstroke! This is the moment the tables turn!
I see... It appears you've put me in checkmate.
So it goes. You held the whole course of the battle in the palm of your hand.
Who knew getting backed into a corner could be so much fun?
No, not yet! I won't let you end things this easily!
That went well beyond my wildest expectations!What an exceptional battle!
That went above and beyond my expectations.What a marvelous battle.
And so we prove that the strongest and most amazing of all is...actually you!
