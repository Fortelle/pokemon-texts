Oh goodness, hello to you! Welcome, welcome, come in. You must be a strong Trainer. Yes, quite strong indeed... That's just wonderful news! Facing opponents like you and your team will make my Pokémon grow like weeds!
Oh goodness, hello to you! Welcome, welcome! Come in! You know, my grandparents came to Kalos from a distant region. They came from a town where the past lives on... When I was growing up at their knees, they raised me on tales of the Pokémon of time and space. It's really thanks to those stories that I decided to become a Dragon-type Trainer.
Oh, you! You're too much! You and your Pokémon are simply charming!
Oh, you're going already? Farewell, then!
Oh, dear me. Was I the first to lose to you all? If I've made you feel too confident, that won't be very fair to the others... But I suppose you'd best hurry along to that elevator over there to face them for yourself.
And I was even the second you've beaten! Ah, I suppose it's just as well, really... Go on. It's time for you to show the last two of us how strong you are.
With your Pokémon, I'm sure you can beat the last of us.
You have beaten all of the Elite Four! This is just wonderful for you. Congratulations!
