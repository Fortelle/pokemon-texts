I am a traveling minstrel, wandering the world. Please listen to my song and hear my words... The Kalos region, now upheld as fair, From ancient days an ugly past doth bear. The woes of war did knock on every door, Till man nor Pokémon could take no more, Three thousand years ago, upon this shore.
So many lives were lost--both man and 'mon. It seemed a night that ne'er would bring dawn. No beauty, no joy in those days of yore. Only the pain of parting was in store For victims of the ancient Kalos war.
Man's grief brought the end, the land did tear, Wartime finished in a lightning flare. 'Mon's rage brought the end, a furious roar. Lightning crackled forth to end the war-- Kalos's long pain was then no more.
One man, through it all, lives ever on. To a Pokémon once lost, he's ever drawn. One man, through it all, lives ever on. Searching for his heart, long lost and gone.
Would you care to listen on... to the completion of my song?
The Kalos region, now upheld as fair, From ancient days an ugly past doth bear. The woes of war did knock on every door, Till man nor Pokémon could take no more, Three thousand years ago, upon this shore. So many lives were lost--both man and 'mon.

'Mon's rage brought the end, a furious roar, Lightning crackled forth to end the war-- Kalos's long pain was then no more. One man, through it all, lives ever on. To a Pokémon once lost, he's ever drawn. One man, through it all, lives ever on. Searching for his heart, long lost and gone. At last his labors brought end to his chore. Bountiful kindness from his heart did pour, His Pokémon to part with nevermore.
It pleases me to know that you were pleased by my song, sirmiss.
