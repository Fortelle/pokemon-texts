Hey, Trainer! Not a good idea to leave the city when you still have pending matters with Korrina.
This kind Lapras here once saved me from drowning! I feel bad, though. I can't afford to travel around and show it the wide world beyond these parts. Hey, I've got an idea! You've got a Rumble Badge! You must be a strong and seasoned traveler! Would you mind taking Lapras with you on your journey?
Looks like your party is already full of a fine bunch of Pokémon. If you want to take Lapras with you, free up a spot then come back here.
Sure!
I couldn't...

How about you give Lapras a nickname?
Lapras! It's time for you to move on! Go out and swim to your heart's content all across Kalos!
I know I might seem like a bad Trainer, trying to force my Lapras on you like this, and I can't blame you for feeling that way... But I really just want to give Lapras a chance to see the world!
It's a good idea to raise Pokémon while traveling the world. That way, they get to have all kinds of valuable experiences!
Lapras! This Trainer will surely be able to take you on some grand adventures! Well, get out there and see the world!
Route 12 Also known as Fourrage Road
Trainer Tips! Pokémon can use HM moves even when they aren't feeling well enough to battle!
