Hmm? You're--?! Our secret HQ went up in flares because of you! That's right... But, well, at least Team Flare went out with style...
Though that was no kinda style, huh? The way we tried to save ourselves... Just leaving everyone else to burn...
I thought it over again and again, like thinking was going out of style... And, in the end, I think the world'd be pretty dull if everyone was all the same. I don't wanna cramp anyone's style anymore...
The Pokémon Kyurem... Doesn't anyone have it?
That's Kyurem! Then, take these...
The great Pokémon Kyurem can use those DNA Splicers... Then it can absofuse with Reshiram or Zekrom!
