Hey, it's me... Yeah, I'm waiting at Hotel Richissime... Aw, quit complaining! Just hop a taxi and get over here already! Seriously!
I wonder if the inside of a Poké Ball is as nice and cushy as this hotel...
I stay here every week, just to see the lovely concierge, Esse!
Rich. ♪ Rich. ♪ Richissime. ♪ Rich-rich. ♪ Richissime. ♪
Welcome to Hotel Richissime, where we are proud to offer the most select service in the whole city. Will you be staying with us today? If so, it will be $100,000...
I understand, good sirfair lady. Please do visit us again.
I see, sirmiss, how much you would like to stay at our exclusive establishment... But I am afraid that you do not have the funds to do so. I hope you understand.
This is the kitchen, ain't it? I may just be a dishwasher, but I'll be watchin' you like a Watchog!
Huhuhu... This is the Unopenable Room... I took a mop, see, and barred the door...
I swear, I'd forget my own head if it weren't screwed on! I have to take notes for everything!
Then please enjoy your stay, and refresh both yourself and your Pokémon, sirmiss.
We have been instructed by our hotel manager to escort you to a very special room, Masteriss <var>.
I see, good sirfair lady! You and your Pokémon look very well rested, indeed! We eagerly wait for your next visit!
This way, please.
Here we go! The special rooms really are something, y'know?
Please allow me to show you the way. This way. Time is precious when acting as a guide, as well.
Ah-haha! That's great! Let's get this show on the road then!
<var> had a fantastic stay with hiser Pokémon!
