I'm the Day-Care Man. We take care of the precious Pokémon of other Trainers. If you'd like us to raise your Pokémon, have a word with my wife.
Glad you came! <var>'s doing just fine!
Glad you came! Your <var> and <var> are doing just fine. The two seem to get along very well!
Glad you came! Your <var> and <var> are doing just fine. The two seem to get along.
Glad you came! Your <var> and <var> are doing just fine. The two don't really seem to like each other very much.
Glad you came! Your <var> and <var> are doing just fine. The two prefer to play with other Pokémon more than with each other.
Ah, it's you! We were raising your Pokémon, and my goodness, we were so surprised! Your Pokémon was holding an Egg! We don't know how it got there, but your Pokémon had it. You do want it, don't you?
<var> received the Egg from the Day-Care Man.
Please take good care of it!
You have no room for it right now... Come back when you've made room.
I will take it and never give it back. You do want this Egg, don't you?
Well then, I'll hang on to it. Thank you!
I'm the Day-Care Lady. We can raise Pokémon for you. Would you like us to raise your Pokémon?
I'm the Day-Care Lady. We can raise Pokémon for you. What do you want to do today?
Very well. Please come again.
Ah, there you are! My husband was looking for you.
You can't leave your only Pokémon with me! How would you battle? Please come back with more Pokémon.
Which Pokémon should we raise for you?
Oh... That is merely an Egg!
Fine. We'll raise your <var> for a while.
Please come back for it later.
We can raise two of your Pokémon. Would you like us to raise another?
You have energetic Pokémon! Would you like your Pokémon back?
By level, your <var> has grown by about <var>.
If you want your <var> back, it will cost $<var>. Would you like it back?
You don't have enough money...
<var> took <var> back from the Day-Care Lady.
Would you like to take the other one back, too?
Oh... If you leave that Pokémon with me, you'll be left with just one. You will be better off if you catch some more.
You have no room for it right now... Please come back when you've made room.
