I am researching Pokémon Fossils here.
You have a Fossil, don't you? Shall I restore it for you?
What's this? You seem to have plenty of Pokémon with you already. Are you still sure you want me to turn your Fossil back into a Pokémon?
Which Fossil should I restore for you?
OK, then! I'll turn that <var> back into a Pokémon for you!
Oh, you'd like to keep it as a Fossil? OK!
I'm working to turn your Fossil back into a Pokémon right now!
I restored the Fossil you gave me, turning it back into a Pokémon! This is <var>! Please take good care of it.
<var> received <var>!
Would you like to give your new <var> a nickname?
Oh, I'm sorry. Your party is full. I will take care of this Pokémon for now, but please come back to pick it up later!
If you have a Fossil, bring it to me!
