Why hello, <var>!
Congratulations!
I see you finally obtained everything you need for Mega Evolution!
A Mega Stone for the Pokémon, a Mega Ring for the Trainer, and a strong bond with your Pokémon.
A strong bond?
It's only a hypothesis, but I think the bond between Pokémon and Trainer is the key to this new Evolution. But what is this bond, exactly? And why are there examples of Mega Evolution only in the Kalos region? There's still so much we don't know...
Does this make you think of something like Kalos's Legendary Pokémon? Found only here in the Kalos region, right? Nowhere else? Maybe that's not a coincidence.
Oh! What an excellent point! Indeed!
The more you know, the more there is to research! The excitement never ends, does it?
Oh, that's right! I came here to give you this!
Use the HM Fly to pop right over to Pokémon Centers of places you've already visited! Well then, <var>...
Diantha, I hope to see you both again soon!
Bonds... They really are important to us all, aren't they? When I'm acting, I think I'm always trying to forge a bond between myself and the character I'm playing. If all I think about is how I'm nothing like a character, then I'll just hate playing it. But if I focus on what I have in common with the character and put myself in her shoes, I might be able to understand her. It's the same for people--or Pokémon.
Oh, never mind me! I'm just babbling about my own things. Let's have a battle the next we meet, shall we? I'm still looking forward to it!
Tee hee! Even the movie star Diantha rides the monorail! Visitors always have a one-track mind about it! How's that for a one-liner! Ha ha ha!
Welcome. Will you be riding the monorail?
Please talk to the person at the counter before boarding the monorail.
