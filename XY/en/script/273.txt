Welcome to the Coumarine Hotel!
Don't you just love it when you have something in common with a celebrity? I'm just like Ramos! I always keep a Gogoat with me, too!
Did you know that the famous movie star Diantha comes to this hotel often? Imagine if I could stay in the room she always uses. I might get a taste of what it's like to be a star!
Some gang of goons calling themselves Team Flare is out and about causing a bit of a ruckus. No good could possibly come from associating with such delinquents!
I should have looked into Team Flare more... Those who remain ignorant are more easily manipulated by villains.
I can tell that you're a very kind Trainer by looking at how happy <var> is to be with you! Since you're so friendly with your Pokémon, I'm going to give you this Lucky Egg!
Give one of your Pokémon a Lucky Egg, and it will earn slightly more Exp. Points than usual!
Bring a Pokémon that you're really friendly with, and I'll give you something nice!
Rrr rill!
