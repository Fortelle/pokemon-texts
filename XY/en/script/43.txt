Hi, <var>!
An acquaintance of yours? Two visitors to Shabboneau Castle? I can't remember the last time we've been so busy! This castle, chateau if you will, was a manor house of a noble family.
It may be a little run down, but that's because there's history to this place.
During that history, the owners of this castle gave away a lot of their stuff to everyone, so that's why it feels so empty. The end.
That's it?! Don't you have anything related to Mega Evolution?
That's it. What in the world is Mega Evolution?
...
Sir! It's back again.
Is it that time of year already? Well, there's nothing I can do about that now...
I need to go to Route 7, but please take your time and have a look around.
I wonder what that's about.
Why don't we go to Route 7, too?

It's a beautiful display case.
