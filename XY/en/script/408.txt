Greetings, sirmiss. This is the gate to Route 14.
Cafés sure are strange places, don't you think? The people sitting in the café watch the people who walk past, and the people who walk past watch the people who are sitting in the café.
The power outage has messed up something in the gate. Clemont is probably busy over at the Gym, so it's up to me to figure out how to fix it.
To make Lumiose City even more beautiful, all of the power lines have been laid underground.
