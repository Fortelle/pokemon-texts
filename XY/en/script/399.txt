You think you can just ride for free?! Give me my money! Give it to me, punk!
Now I'm never gonna hit my quota for the day! Awww, this day stinks!
Why, you! You won't get away with this! That money is my life! My rent! My dinner!
Fine! Whatever! I get it! Just get outta my taxi!
You won't be getting away with this! You little sneak! I'll teach you a lesson!
Tsk... Fine. I mean, great. Thanks for riding with me.
You'd better not be getting cocky, kid. Otherwise your Pokémon'll pay for you!
I'm still proud of myself. G'wan, get outta here. Forget the fare!
Just what I was hoping for! This should help wake me up!
That was good! Let's do it again sometime! But bring some money and pay your fare!
I come out to earn a living, don't I? So why you gotta tax me like this?
Now I won't even have a copper to send back to my family in Hoenn...
I won't go easy just because you're a child! Feel my Judgment, thief!
I'm begging you, child. Don't keep doing these kinds of illicit things.
Riding without paying is a crime! I'll run you down, you little thief!
My Pokémon came to a screeching halt... Idling is just the same as stopping, really...
Beep! Beep! Brrrrr-ooom! I used to be a Biker, buddy!
The only thing in my wallet is air... My pocketbook's just gathering dust...
Watch out, kid, we Drivers are strong! Driving these roads takes real strength!
You're strong. You wanna join us? You can make bank if you work hard!
Oho... Slow down there, kid. I'll bounce off you like a speed bump.
Aha. You managed to just beat me. My tank's empty...and the same for my team...
