Heya! Do you still travel with a Pokémon a professor gave you? If you two have a strong bond, there's a special move it can learn... Want me to teach it a battle-combo move?
A special move... Should I teach it a battle-combo move?
I can't teach these Pokémon.
Is that so... Well, come on back now, y'hear?
Which Pokémon should learn the move?
Now, that Pokémon can't learn this special move! How about we try it with a Pokémon you get from a Pokémon Professor?
Teach a move to an Egg? What kinda crazy talk is that?!
This Pokémon... Well, it doesn't look like it's too comfortable with you yet.
I can't teach it twice. This Pokémon already knows the special move!
Want me to teach <var> to <var>?
The Pokémon I've taken a shine to are the ones you get from the professor! To teach all of these Pokémon a special move, a battle-combo move... That's my pledge!
