Let me tell you about my brother's mysterious power! With it, he can reverse Pokémon type matchups! It's really crazy! Normally, a Fire-type move would be super effective against a Grass-type Pokémon, but with my brother's mysterious power, it's the opposite! Fire-type moves become not very effective against Grass-type Pokémon! What are you waiting for? Get out there, and try to use as many supereffective moves as you can!
