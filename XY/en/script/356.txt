The Eerie Impulse that some Pokémon can emit... I wonder what about it is all that eerie.
Well, would you look at that! Your <var> there knows Eerie Impulse! Please! Won't you have it show me its Eerie Impulse move? Just once?
<var> used Eerie Impulse!
Aha! So it's the frequency of the wave! I understand completely now. Thank you! You've been a great help!
It seems that the Eerie Impulse that some Pokémon can emit lowers the Sp. Attack stat of targets with the peculiar frequency of the impulse's wavelength!
Mom and Dad left us behind to travel around the world. All to train their Pokémon. That's why my little brother, Trevor, has always dreamed of traveling all over Kalos with a Pokédex of his own...
Mew-phoo!
Pu-puppu!
