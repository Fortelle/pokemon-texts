You're here, <var>! That is good. I need 30 seconds of your time, no more. It is about our new friend, Emma. Ever since she started living here at the office, I have detected some signs of stress in her. This has caused me to worry. What do you think, <var>? Could it be that there is something wrong?
Interesting, interesting... So, has she confided in you? Or did you use some of the brilliant detective skills you learned from my class? You're an approachable person, <var>, which encourages others to open up to you. You know, when I first invited Emma to live here, my intention was to become a guardian to her. I promised to do everything for her as a parent would. I...I do hope my feelings of responsibility are not burdening her.
Of course, of course! If my partner says nothing is wrong, then, indeed, nothing could be wrong. I was a little worried that living in a strange place and studying all day might be causing her stress... Hah! But my concerns prove untrue. It is just like a grim detective such as myself to see mysteries in everything.
おねがいです！　たすけてください！ たいせつな　ポケモンちゃんが ぬすまれて　しまったんです！
Oho! What have we here? One of our fair city's famous tourists! From your manner of speaking, madame, I deduce that you have traveled far indeed! I am...Looker. What may I do for you?
わたしの　ことばが　わかるんですね ああ　よかった！　たすかります！ わたし　このくにの　ことばは ヒアリングしか　できなくて！ じつは　えきで　わたしの　たいせつな ポケモンちゃんたちが　ぬすまれて！ それで　ここが　たんていじむしょ　だって きいたから　うかがったんですよ！ どうか　おねがいします！ いますぐ　わたしの　ポケモンちゃんを とりかえして　いただけませんか？
Ahem... My dear lady... I am so terribly sorry, but could you speak a bit less quickly?
すっ　すいません…… でも　いそいでるんですよ！ たいせつな　ポケモンちゃんを とりかえさないと　そこく　に かえることも　できません！ ひこうきの　じかん　だって せまって　きているんですよ！
Ahem... From what I can gather, it seems that this lady has been given sore offense. And do you know why that would be, <var>, my friend? Well, thanks to my gift for languages-- I've traveled all over the world, you know... It seems she is highly offended that she has come as a guest and not yet been offered tea! Yes! Case closed!
Which means, my friend, I must make haste to obtain the requisite tea! <var>, please keep our guest company until my return from this vital mission.
ちょっと　なんなのよ！　あの　ひと！！ ぜんぜん　わかってないじゃない！ わたしは　のんきに　おちゃ　なんて のんでる　ばあいでは　ないんです！ はやく　ポケモンちゃんを　たすけて！
I'm home, Mr. Looker!
Mrrrawwrrr!
Oh! <var>! Welcome back! Is Mr. Looker out? And who's this old lady?
ちょっと　なんなの　この　こ！ オバサンなんて　しつれいねっ！！ みなりが　きたない　にんげんは ことば　まで　けがれているわね！ さっき　でていった　ルッカー　とかいう バカな　おとこの　こども　かしら？
……ちょっと　オバサン なんて　こと　いうの……？ あたしのことは　どうでも　いい…… けど　ルッカーおじさん　のこと わるく　いうのは　ゆるさない…… ……それにさ　あたしが おじさんの　こどもの　わけ　ないよ ……おじさんに　しつれい　だよ
まっ！？ あなた　わたしの　ことばが　わかるの？
うん……　まあね…… だいたいで　なんとなく　だけど このまち　って　おそとに　いると いろんな　くにの　ことばで おはなし　してるのが　きこえるから いつのまにか　おぼえちゃったの
Hmm... If we keep going like this, then <var> is gonna be totally lost... And I don't feel like opening up the trash talk with this old lady again...
Hey, Mimi! How about it? Do you think you can help us out with your power?
Mrrrawwwr!
ああ……　よかったわ…… ことばが　つうじる　ひとが　いて さっきの　しつれいな　はつげんは どうか　ゆるしてください…… きもちに　よゆうが　なかったんです いのちより　だいじな　ポケモンちゃんを ぬすまれて　こんらん　してしまって……
Is this Mimi's mystical power? Somehow you can hear the strange woman's thoughts in your head... ... ... ... It seems she feels sorry for saying rude things about Looker and Emma. ... ... ... And the real reason she is so troubled is that her precious Pokémon were stolen!
ふーん…… で？　どこで　ぬすまれたの？
Is this Mimi's mystical power? Somehow you can hear Emma's thoughts in your head... ... ... ... She doesn't think highly of the insulting woman, that's for sure. ... ... ... It seems she is still worried about the stolen Pokémon.
このまちの　えきで！ ガラの　わるい　れんちゅうが あゆみよったら　つぎの　しゅんかんに バッグと　なかに　いれた ボールが　ぬすまれました！
Is this Mimi's mystical power? Somehow you can hear the strange woman's thoughts in your head... She was walking through the train station when it happened... ... ... ... A man sneaked up behind her, and then he stole her Bag. ... ... ... The woman did her best to chase him, but he got away...
……えき ……ガラの　わるい　れんちゅう もしかして……　あのこ　たち　かな？
Is this Mimi's mystical power? Somehow you can hear Emma's thoughts in your head... ... ... ... It seems that Emma has some idea of who the man might have been...
I return! My apologies for the delay. I have obtained the finest quality tea, since our guest obviously has exquisite taste!
Oho! Emma and Mimi are back as well! Yes. Excellent timing all round. Emma, have you introduced yourself to our visitor from a faraway land?
Murrrr-mrrrawwwr. ♪
Your link to the others' thoughts suddenly disappears. It seems Mimi's mysterious power was somehow interrupted.
Oh! What have we here? Mimi! Are you happy to see me come home, too? Why... I wondered if it would ever happen. I have won over the hard-boiled Mimi!
Um, Mr. Looker? This old lady here says her Pokémon were stolen. I'd guess the thieves are still in Lumiose Station...
What's that? What's that you're saying? Then it wasn't tea that she was after? But I bought this...fancy...expensive... No! Hah! Never mind that! Let us focus on what is most important now! Come, my friends! We have a case!
Just a minute, Mr. Looker.
What is it, Emma? Didn't you hear? Her Pokémon have been stolen! We must get them back at once!
I'd bet anything that the guy who stole this old lady's Pokémon was part of the Lumiose Gang. They're rough types, you know? If we stick our noses in, that means a battle for sure...
Pardon? Whom? The Lumiose Gang?
Yeah. So let's drop it, OK? You know, that old lady was talking trash about you while you were out. She ain't nice. It's not worth having a great big fight to help a person like her.
そっ　そんな！！
No, Emma.
That is not on!
If you see someone in trouble, give help. If you see a Pokémon in distress, you help! That is the policy of the Looker Bureau! And it does not change! No matter what this person may have said about me, it does not change what we do! Now, wait here, please. I must go to Lumiose Station.
Mr. L-L-Looker... ... ... ...
<var>, help Mr. Looker! Please! He doesn't even have a Pokémon! H-he once said something... A long time ago, he had a Pokémon. A partner that was always with him... But... They were on a case...and...and... I don't know what happened, but... his partner didn't make it...
If he tries to stand up to the Lumiose Gang without a single Pokémon on his side, he doesn't have a chance! Oh, please! Oh, please. Go help him!
You're his partner now, aren't you? Don't let him go alone!
Oh, <var>. Thank...you... The Lumiose Gang is always somewhere on the platforms at Lumiose Station, up on North Boulevard... I think you're powerful enough to face them, <var>... But be ready for anything! Just in case!
Don't say that! Mr. Looker has faith in you, <var>! He truly does! He...he said that when he looks at you, it almost makes him feel like he has his lost Pokémon partner back again! He...he said there's something in your eyes, somehow the same look... So he felt he could trust you...
どうか　おねがい　します！！ あたしの　ポケモンちゃんを とりかえして　きて　ください！！
Mrrrawwwrrr!
LOOKER'S TOP-SECRET JOURNAL ･ The XXth day of the XXth month... I am happy to report that Emma has learned to read and write and do basic arithmetic. I must be truthful and say that her progress is due to the diligence of her brilliant instructor. Ha ha. Emma's intelligence and keen focus on her studies have ensured her steady progress.
LOOKER'S TOP-SECRET JOURNAL ･ The XXth day of the XXth month... Recently, I have begun to be accepted by the Pokémon Mimi. When I pat its head, it barely lashes out. When I leave for the evening to go home to my room at the hotel, it cries sadly. It remains cautious when meeting strange adults, but this is evidence to me of trauma in its past. I wonder what happened, but prying into another's secrets is not good manners, whether person or Pokémon. I simply continue my effort to deepen my bonds with Mimi.
Hey, hey, hey! Wotcher doin' here, old man? You wander in here by mistake or what? 'Cause you'd hafter be off yer trolley to come alone an' pick a fight with us.
Indeed. Hold that thought. I am not here to pick a fight. Instead, I have a simple request. Return that tourist's stolen Pokémon!
Yer jokin', right? If we just give 'em back wit' a pretty please and thank-you, sir, why'd we bother stealin' sumfink?!
Lookee, old man... Yer that Looker whatsisface, eh? Who we are is the Lumiose Gang, and we can't stand the sight of you, got it? Ever since Emma went to live at yours, she ain't never come round to hang with us!
What do you mean?
Y'hear me? It's just not on! Why did we nab these lame Pokémon, did y'ask yerself? It were just to get yer into our manor, weren't it? So yer done, old man! Get yer Pokémon out for battle! If yer win, yer take the Pokémon! But... If yer lose, yer got nothin' more to do with our Emma!
I cannot accept your challenge.
Oo-er! Yer too scared to fight? Or are yer givin' it that yer don't have even a single Pokémon to stand by yer?
You...er..."got it in one."
Nyahahaha! Yer not havin' us on? Fine, we'll give yer a shot to ready yerself! Go find some tall grass or somethin'... Then come back an' get yer hat handed to yer!
Argh. Words are no use here. I'll have to go. Later, I'll return, and--
Oh! <var>!
Ahaha...ahem. You've caught me making an enormous fool of myself. It is as they say. The great Looker has no Pokémon of his own... I can do nothing to restore the stolen Pokémon to that tourist...
Oi, mouth! Who are ya? Yer with this old man, eh? Naw then. Yer can take his place, like. Yer win, an' we hand over the Pokémon. How do ya like yer chances, eh?! Nyahaha!
<var>, my friend... I'm afraid this is all I can do for you.
If yer mates with that old geezer, then yer ain't no friend to me! At least yer got Pokémon... A punch-up? Let's be havin' yer!
For Emma, anything! For you, a knuckle sandwich!
Ah, get lost! I got nothin' to say to a pillock like you.
Wh-wh-what's with you? Gah! You're too strong...
Guess it's down to me to teach you what's what. Easy peasy!
Don't mind if I do, 'cause I'm gonna do it for Emma!
Aw, yer a bit of a lightweight, incha? Yer all of a tremble... Poor ickle thing.
Well now... Yer stronger than you look, you cheeky thing.
Hey, hey, hey! Stop yer messin' about! Beat me? Yer not serious!
Yer wut now? Yer wut?! Let's do this! We need Emma here with us, got it?!
Nyahaha! Rubbish in a bin. Run along home, an' I'll let yer go.
Whazza... What a pain... Right, then! I'll just have yer...
Stop it, all of you!
Emma!
Stop it! I mean it! And return those stolen Pokémon!
Well, if that don't take the biscuit! This is down to you, Emma. Yer just couldn't be bothered with us no more. What's the point of us if yer don't show up? Yer the boss of this gang! Did yer think how we missed yer? Goin' off with this bad news and never a thought to yer old mates. Thanks for nothin'!
Oh, put a sock in it! I said up front--don't count me in. You went ahead and called me boss without even asking what I wanted. I decide for myself! Now, back off before I really lose it!
N-no! N-n-not that! We got it, boss! We got it! Yer don't have to be the boss! We've just been missing yer since yer stopped comin' round! Here, we'll give yer back the Poké Balls, so forgive us--aight?!
Right. Well, enough said. I'll let it go this time, but... You need to say sorry to the lady you stole from. And to Mr. Looker, too!
Yes, ma'am! I will! I'm awful sorry for nickin' the Pokémon. Yer got me bang to rights. Forgive me?
Ahem. Of course. The Pokémon shall be safely restored, so let's call it water under the bridge.
A-a-a-a-and...case closed! Cheers, <var>, Emma! Let's head back to the Looker Bureau!
OK!
Oh, I forgot something... Wait. Thirty seconds!
Hey, folks!
...Eh?
It's your wish to be friends with Emma, is that correct?
Yer sussed that out, eh?
When people behave with evil intentions, I cannot turn away and lightly forgive such. Especially people who do cruel and thoughtless things. For example, stealing the beloved Pokémon of other Trainers...
However... I believe... No. Not just believe. I KNOW... People and Pokémon are both capable of...evolving. And so... If you give your word of honor not to ever lift a hand in cruelty again, then you may come by the Looker Bureau anytime to visit Emma...as her friends.
Mr. L-L-Looker...
Sir...
Let us now return! Back once more to the Looker Bureau!
Mr. Looker... I'm really sorry about what happened earlier... When that woman insulted you, I just saw red and I... I...
If you learned something from it, that is all I need to hear, Emma. But that is not what concerns me now. Imagine how I felt to discover that you were the boss of that gang!
Oh, it's just silly. I wasn't in the gang for real! I had a big fight with them one time, and after I took them down, they figured I was their boss. It was all their idea, not mine!
She may look like a cute kid, but Emma is crazy strong! Sh-she really is, Looker, sir. And Mr.iss <var>!
Well, it's the lad from the gang. You're here for a visit already? Good. Ahem. You can drop that "sir" business. Call me Looker.
As yer say, sir. ...Looker. Here's the thing, see. Us in the Lumiose Gang are gonna evolve, just like yer said! We're all done wi' chorin' an' cheatin'. We're lookin' for honest work. So please let us come round an' see our Emma, won't yer?
... ... ...
That's excellent. Deciding to change your course in life is more than an Evolution! It is a Mega Evolution! There is no substitute for honest work if you want to make a difference in this world.
Yeah, that's right, then. See yer later, eh, Emma?
Hey, Mr. Looker?
Hm? What is it, Emma?
Mr. Looker... You said there is no substitute for honest work if you want to make a difference in this world. But I don't do any work at all... You asked me to be your assistant. But I've never done any work the whole time I've been staying here. All I've done is learn things from you... Is that really enough? Is it really OK for me to be here?
These are good questions, Emma. You have been learning nonstop since you came here, have you not? Learning is very important work at any age, and especially for you now. Continue to pour your heart into your studies. You have no need to worry.
But, Mr. Looker... We're always here in the Looker Bureau. And there's almost never any clients! Are Mimi and I just getting in your way? I mean, you went and turned down taking money from that tourist lady. Be straight with me, Mr. Looker. I'm asking, really, if it's really OK for Mimi and I to stay here...moneywise?
Y-you have no need to worry! One would expect that a hard-boiled detective has savings set aside, indeed! Yes, indeed, Looker's savings are as lofty as Sinnoh's own Mt. Coronet! Hm. Perhaps you have not met up with Mt. Coronet in your studies yet, Emma? Ha...hahaha! I ask you to leave such worries to me. Your part is to study hard, so you can become my trusted assistant. Deal? Good.
Hey, Mimi...
Mrawr?
Mr. Looker said we didn't need to worry about anything, y'know? But I just don't feel like we can keep depending on him like this forever. He lets us stay here for free and pays for all the food we eat...
Mrrrawr mrawr...
So I think I need to do something.
Mrrr-mrrrawr!
Thanks to Mr. Looker, I can read now, right? And I've seen signs around town for part-time work.
Murrr?
The signs say it's easy work and anyone can learn it. Maybe even I can do it, then! I'm going over there right now to ask them for a job! What do you think, Mimi?
Murrr-murrrawr! ♪
Hee hee hee, really?
Oh, <var>! Have you seen Emma? She always seems to be out and about these days. When I ask for details, she has nothing to say... I'm a bit worried. If you see her, would you let her know that?
Mrrrawwwr...
LOOKER'S TOP-SECRET JOURNAL ･ The XXth day of the XXth month... Emma has been going out more and more often. I find it worrying, not knowing where she goes. Is this perhaps how a father feels? ･ The XXth day of the XXth month... The young people from the gang came by to tell us that they had secured part-time work. I've never worked within the Community Safety Department, but even I do feel quite moved to see young people turning their lives around.
