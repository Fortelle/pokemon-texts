This is the Pokémon Day Care! They take care of Pokémon for you here.
Yes indeed! You can leave up to two Pokémon here at once!
I seem to remember something good can happen if you leave two Pokémon here.
That's right! Sometimes we'll find a new addition--like an Egg! If you carry the Egg around, a Pokémon will emerge from it!
Wow! A Pokémon will come out? Maybe I'll leave some Pokémon here! Having the same Pokémon with the same moves might step my dance up!
How about you, <var>?
Maybe I will!
Some other time.
There aren't many Pokémon I want to raise. I'll try it on some other occasion.
That's one way to look at it. Well, I'm gonna go look for some Pokémon for my dance team!
Hey! Wait! Tierno! Wait up!
Sometimes the Pokémon that hatch from Eggs know the same moves as the Pokémon you left at the Day Care.
