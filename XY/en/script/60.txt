Would you like to trade Poké Miles for prizes?
PokéMileage is the service that allows you to collect miles when you trade Pokémon or pass by people. Miles that you can get depend on the distance between two regions registered on the Nintendo 3DS systems. You can also collect a little bit of miles by walking in the Kalos region. To check your current miles, please check Poké Miles on your Trainer Card.
Collect Poké Miles and come again.
