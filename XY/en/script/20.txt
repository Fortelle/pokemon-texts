One of the ways that Pokémon Trainers make their Pokémon strong is to use TMs! I know it's a bit sudden, but do tell me: Do you have the TM for <var>?
I know! It's so sudden again! But tell me: Do you have the TM for <var>?
It's certainly the TM for <var>! Are you making your Pokémon even stronger by using it?
What? I can't find the TM for <var> anywhere.
Are you a reserved person?
By utilizing TMs well, your Pokémon can beat its opponent even if your Pokémon is weak against it! You can use TMs as many times as you want! If you don't like a move, you can ask a man in town to help a Pokémon forget it!
Even when it's cold, I wear shorts! But that's not a facade! This is Facade!
The move Facade doubles its power if the user is poisoned, badly poisoned, paralyzed, or burned!
