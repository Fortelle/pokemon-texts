<var>! Welcome home! It looks like the road has been a little rough on you, hasn't it? Why don't you rest up a little before hitting the road again?
What did I tell you? You and your Pokémon look much better now! You know, honey... Whenever your Pokémon get too down or run out of HP like that, you can always come home and let them rest for a while. If you're headed far from home, you should buy some Potions at the Poké Mart in Aquacorde Town or someplace. Taking proper care of your Pokémon is one of the basics for a Trainer! Now get back out there and show the world what you've got! Love you!
First, let's restore your Pokémon to full health.
Please visit a Pokémon Center if your Pokémon's HP goes down. If you're planning to travel any great distance, you should stock up on Potions at a Poké Mart. Good luck out there, Trainer!
There! All happy and healthy! Good luck and take care!
