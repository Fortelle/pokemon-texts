Fighters who want to master the art of Pokémon battles gather here.
Moves, Abilities, and items that seem to have only adverse effects can actually be positive if you combine them with other elements.
Some Abilities have effects when the Pokémon with that Ability takes a direct attack. That means, if your Pokémon attacks the opposing Pokémon carelessly, your Pokémon may get hurt!
Some Abilities take effect when a Pokémon enters battle. In these cases, the order in which Pokémon enter battle is important! Sometimes being later than the opposing Pokémon works better.
Some moves enable the user to attack first regardless of the Pokémon's Speed.
We're asking our master to teach us as a special favor!
What do martial artists serve at a party? All kinds of punch...
It's best to enjoy battles! If I lose and get frustrated, I'll listen to what everyone else says.
Lucaaa!
Digdig.
