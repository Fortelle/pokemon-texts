Seeing the monorail going back and forth like it does reminds me of a Metronome.
If a Pokémon holding a Metronome uses one move over and over again, that move's power will go up!
Which do you think is cooler: Pokémon or monorails?
I think both Pokémon and monorails are cool! But monorails are cool because you can see really far away while on board!
Hello! Would you like to ride the monorail?
If you'd like to ride the monorail, just speak to the lady at the counter over there.
