If you want to give your Pokémon a treat, it should at least be a Deluxe Poké Puff!
When my sweet Pokémon smiles at me, I can't help but smile back! And do you know what happens then? It makes my Pokémon, like, super happy! And what happens after that is... I get, like, unbelievably happy, too!
Myaow myaow?
The more that you play with your Pokémon, the more likely they'll show you new moves! Being able to really feel and see that they like you more and more--what could make you happier?
Sigh... You know, my Pokémon... Even when I pet it, it doesn't react much... Sigh... I guess it's true what they say... Pokémon do take after their Trainers...
Oooh! If you want a sweet and cute Pokémon, then you've gotta have an unevolved Pokémon! I just can't get enough of the eager and energetic nature of an unevolved Pokémon!
Ahhh! If you want a Pokémon you can stroke and caress, it's gotta be an evolved Pokémon! I just can't get enough of the cool, mature attitude of an evolved Pokémon!
Pmmpha!
Have you ever poked a Pikachu's cheek?
It's TOTALLY shocking, right?!
It'll TOTALLY shock you!
I thought I was the one who was taking care of my Pokémon, but maybe I'm the one being cared for.
Rrrrrrill!♪
