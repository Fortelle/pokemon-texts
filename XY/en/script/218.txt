Wait up! ♪ Let's walk together! I feel like something exciting will happen if I stay by you! ♪
Waiting can be kinda fun, too. ♪ OK, let's get going!
Hey? Are you going somewhere else? I'll wait for you here! ♪
Want me to heal your Pokémon, <var>?
OK! I'm on it! ♪
OK! Got it! Take it easy, though.

I wonder what the professor's like.

Your mom's a Rhyhorn racer, right, <var>?
Come out, come out, little Pokémon, wherever you are! ♪


Look what I found, <var>! I'll give it to you! I love puzzles, so I watch everything more closely than you might think! ♪
Look what I found, <var>! Here, for you!
Oh! You have some more Pokémon!
Oh! You have so many Pokémon!
Wow! You caught a Pikachu!
I really want to catch a Pikachu, but I haven't run into a single one...
The weaker a wild Pokémon is, the easier it is to catch.

The weaker a wild Pokémon is, the easier it is to catch.

Santalune Forest, huh? Might be a good place to test my skills.
I could make my way through a forest like this in my sleep.
Do you have any Poké Balls?
Here you go.
No need to be shy or anything.

Do you need any Poké Balls?
Here.
Oh. OK.


Hi, Shauna. Hello, <var>. I'll give you two a little advice. When Pokémon are poisoned, they lose HP when you battle. So be sure to use Antidotes and make them better!

This Youngster challenged me to a Pokémon battle! Let's go!
A battle?!
Um, wild Pokémon are found in the tall grass...

If your Pokémon are weak, you should use a Potion.
First, I'll observe.
Now, into the tall grass!
I wonder what kind of dance works best for a crew with Pokémon in it.
<var>, are you checking your Pokédex diligently? When you capture a Pokémon, you can read detailed information about it there.
So, you're the first to arrive. Looks like my new neighbor is someone with a lot of potential.
So, you got here first. Seems like I'm neighbors with someone who has a lot of potential.
The way Pokémon move--it's just incredible! I want to show off some of that spirit when I dance!
Tierno... Could you think about something besides how Pokémon move for once?
We're all here! Let's go to Santalune City! ♪

This way leads to a dead end, huh? All right! I guess I'll just have to save my progress so I don't forget what I've done so far!

This is Santalune Forest. Keep an eye out for dropped items!
















If you battle, you learn more about your Pokémon partner!



Oh! Hang on one second, <var>! ♪
