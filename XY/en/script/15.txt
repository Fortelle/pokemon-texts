Hello, and welcome to the Couriway Hotel.
You have a Pokédex! Here, let me give you a Pokémon quiz!
What does a li'l Skrelp disguise itself as to find potential prey?
Kelp
Mushrooms
Flowers
What does li'l Clauncher shoot when its internal gas explodes?
Water
Rock
Spikes
Wow! Correct answer! Here's your prize!
I'm sorry! Wrong answer!
Imagining the stuff in the Pokédex makes your world bigger and bigger!
I've heard that a thousand years ago, the Kalos region was mostly forest.
I hear there is a waterfall that flows backward somewhere in the world! I really want to see that!
When I say "waterfall," what's the first thing that comes to mind? It's crazy how you get so many different answers to that question! Seriously! Try asking your friends!
