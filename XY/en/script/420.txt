What's the hustle, little Crustle? Welcome to Santalune City Gym! So, future Champ, this'll be your first time challenging a Gym, huh? Are you thrilled? Are you pumped? You should be! No worries here! You've got Pokémon on your side! And really, they're the ones who are gonna be doing all the battling. Am I right or am I right? Right?
Jump on that pole there, and you'll be on your way to where the Gym Leader's a-waitin' for you! Whoops! But wait! Before you go, I'm supposed to tell you something!
Everybody in this Pokémon Gym uses Bug-type Pokémon. Got it?
We've gone ahead and engraved your name on those mysterious statues there, didja see? In recognition of your excellence and all that!
Whoa-ho-ho! Wouldja look at that Bug Badge! Nice! Very nice, future Champ! I bet that schmancy-pants professor who gave you your first Pokémon'd be amazed to see it! After you heal up your Pokémon in the Pokémon Center, why don'tcha head on up to the Pokémon Lab in Lumiose City and show it to him, huh?
