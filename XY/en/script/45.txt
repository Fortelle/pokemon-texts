You there! You're seriously going to come all the way to Camphrier Town and leave without even visiting Shabboneau Castle?! You're missing out on half the joy in life! Or...well...maybe not half... A quarter? Hmm, that's probably overblowing it, too. One percent! You're missing at least one percent!
Anyway! The point is! You've really got to check out Shabboneau Castle! After all, it's free to go in!
Shabboneau Castle must look pretty different to you than it does to me. We are different people, after all.
It's about that time again, huh... That lazy lug'll be back soon...
No one wishes more than us that we could give Snorlax gobs of Berries like we used to.
Welcome, welcome, dear visitor! Here, take this for your Pok√©mon!
Even if you try to keep it all for yourself, a human like you or me can't use that!
Hey there! I'll give you this, so tell all your friends to come to Camphrier Town, OK?!
We differentiate ourselves from Lumiose City with our quiet atmosphere of timelessness.
Camphrier Town A town where you can taste the ages.
