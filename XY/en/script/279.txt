I'm sorry I'm late! So, could you show me Mega Evolution?
Of course, whether you use Mega Evolution in battle or not is entirely up to you, but... I'd like to know what the potential of a Pokémon really is...


Even though we set off from Vaniville Town at the same time, you somehow became stronger than I am. What could be so different about us? Well, good luck with your Gym Battle. Do your best, OK?
Sorry to keep you waiting. The reason I wanted to meet you is I want to see Mega Evolution in action.
Whether you use it or not is up to you. But since I'm a Pokémon Trainer, I want to know about things that make Pokémon special.


Even though we set off from Vaniville Town at the same time, there's a gap in our strength. Do you have something I don't? I guess I have to think about that... Well, good luck with your Gym Battle.
<var>! Do you have a Pokémon with the <var> move on you right now?
Awesome! <var> knows <var>!
Thanks! That totally took my dancing to the next level!
If you have a Pokémon with <var>, show it to me! I'll give you something cool!
Having lots of Poké Miles will give you a big smile!
If you use Rain Dance to make it rain, Thunder will never miss! Rain, rain come today!! Drizzle Ability, you're fantastic!

The legends of Kalos say the Legendary Pokémon is in a deep, deep sleep. That's why there aren't many stories about it.
So those Egg-like things that are found at the Pokémon Day Care... Strictly speaking, they're not Eggs. They're more like a Pokémon cradle.
