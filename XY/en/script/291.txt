Hi! Do you have any Flying- or Psychic-type Pokémon with you?
Oh! <var> type is with you! Would you help me get some luggage that's too high for me to reach?
Thank you! I'll give you this!
Having Pokémon with you can be a big help sometimes, eh?
That's too bad. I need a Flying- or Psychic-type Pokémon to help me out.
If you are a Trainer, will you show me how you're raising your Pokémon with loving care?
Oh! You're a shy Trainer.
Which Pokémon will you show me?
...Hmmm. It's hard to tell...
Well...it's a bit hard to tell how much that Egg has grown.
Oh! This <var> was level <var> when you met, but now it's level <var>!
Wow! This is surprising! You trained the Pokémon this much. You've raised it very well. It's received a lot of love from you.
You've raised it quite well. I feel your love for this Pokémon.
You've raised it well. I can feel a bit of love from you.
What? It has not grown at all. Still, if you travel with your Pokémon from now on, I'm sure it will grow!
You walk to raise your Pokémon! This is a token of gratitude for showing me your great love for your Pokémon!
<var> received a Footprint Ribbon!
<var> put the Footprint Ribbon on <var>!
This fantastic Footprint Ribbon shows the love you've given to <var>.
The number of footprints shows the amount of your love... Thank you for showing me the wonderful bond between you and your Pokémon.
As you imitate someone, you'll create your own style. If you want to be strong, it might be a good idea to imitate a strong Trainer.
