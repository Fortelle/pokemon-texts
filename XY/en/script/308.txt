I have Potions... I'm totally ready! I'll challenge the Gym Leader now! Brace yourself, Grant!
Even if Pokémon are of the same species, Pokémon can have different Abilities.
How about this? Would you like to trade <var> for my <var>?
Let's start our Pokémon trade!
Hello, <var>. Nice to meet you.
Hm? What I asked for is <var>.
I understand. Maybe next time.
Every time I see <var>, I will probably remember you.
Ah, I'm sorry. We can't trade because you only have one Pokémon.
