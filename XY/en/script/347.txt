Until recently, this place didn't have a tenant. But somebody finally rented it. I think the tenant will move in pretty soon.
Oh, <var>, how are you? I just finished my work. Thanks to the Expansion Suit, it's easy to go anywhere, and with the Pokémon that Xerosic gave me, I can deal with any kind of job request! Oh, I know! <var>, why don't we have a Pokémon battle?
Great! This'll be fun! Here I come!
Oh, I see... That's a shame...
Hehehe... I lost...
Hehehe... That was great! I knew you must be good at battling, <var>! Looker and the others said you were a Champion. I guess it's true, huh?

Ey! <var>! How are yer gettin' along? Mr. Looker helped us out a lot, so us in the Lumiose Gang are all givin' a hand in return.
Hi! Folks reckon I'm the cute one in the gang! I'm a really good cook, so I cook up a storm!
Hi! They do say I'm the charming one in the gang! I'm good at maths, so I keep hold of all the accounting and finances!
