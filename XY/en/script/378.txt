Welcome.
This world will eventually reach the point of no return... Saving the lives of all is impossible. Only the chosen ones will obtain a ticket to tomorrow. Do you want to have a ticket? Or, do you want to stop me? Show me in battle.
Wah ha ha! Your convictions, and those of your Pokémon, please me!
You are here to stop me. But I ask you to wait. I tried to save people--and the world--with the profit from this lab. But my efforts had no effect... The world was just too vast...and too full of fools that I couldn't save through my hard work alone... That's why I decided the only way to save the world was to take it all for myself.
I don't expect that I will ever make you understand how I think and feel... Try to stop the ultimate weapon if you must, but to do so, you will have to explore our lab and have Pokémon battles with all you meet.
Oh, and as for the Elevator Key, one of the Team Flare Scientists you've met on your journey has it.
Saving everything... The world is suffering because of this absurd dream...




Ah ha ha! Why, if it isn't that fascinating little Trainer from the Kalos Power Plant. So we meet again, just as I said we would!
I don't have the key, but I'll let you pass. But which warp panel could it be? Which one cooould it be?
I had fun at the Kalos Power Plant. Of course, we could have generated electricity with Team Flare's technology, too, you know. We just didn't think it justified the cost. To create a world for us and us alone, we have to play it smart, you see.
It won't move without the Elevator Key.
<var> used the Elevator Key.
