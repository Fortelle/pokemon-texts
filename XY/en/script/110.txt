You're the illustrious <var>, are you? Welcome at last to the Pokémon League. I am one of the Elite Four. People know me as the Fire-type-Pokémon user, Malva.
Here in the Pokémon League, you'll encounter the four of us--the Elite Four--and our Champion.
If you hope to meet the Champion and challenge her here, you must first defeat the four of us. Do your best, because if you can't impress us with your real strength, you'll never get to battle her. But it should be a walk in the park for you, right? The "heroine" who destroyed big, bad Team Flare.
