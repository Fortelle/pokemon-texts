I hear the history of this area goes back to ancient times. You can probably get the details from the guide in the hotel.
For some reason, a Pokémon will not evolve when it holds an Everstone. I have quite a few of them, so I'll share one with you as well.
Could Pokémon and stones have some kind of connection? Think about it. Some Pokémon even evolve when exposed to a Fire Stone or Water Stone.
