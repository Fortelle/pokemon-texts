Well met, young challenger! Verily am I the Elite Four's famed blade of hardened Steel, Wikstrom! With my magnificent Pok√©mon at my side, I will reveal the scope of Trainer achievement! Let us both give our word that our contest shall be fair and honorable. Ready? En garde!
What now? What sweet, glorious pain and joy now rock my mighty heart? My will, which even shakes spears, trembles at so fine a battle as this! I am undone! Good sir, you are indeed our equal-- and worthy to enter this lofty hall!

Easy, child. You need not explain. It is no mystery to me why you came to me first. Nature herself has framed man as such a creature that any would choose to face their strongest enemy before all others. Now, to the elevator with you! It burns with a desire to hasten you on your way!
So you have struck down two of the Elite Four! The road is still long. Do not waver now.
Is your heart prepared for this? One last wall remains before you. You would do well to remember: defeat us, and then you will face the Champion in battle!
The time has come at last for your greatest challenge. Now show our Champion the same strength you have shown us!
