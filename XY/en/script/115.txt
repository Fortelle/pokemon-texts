Hello, hello! I am the official Name Rater! Want me to rate the nicknames of your Pokémon?
Which Pokémon's nickname should I critique?
Hmmm. <var>, is it? That sounds good. It seems very like you. But if you'd like to change it, I can help you do that, too. How about it?
Excellent! What would you like the new nickname to be?
Done! From now on, this Pokémon shall be known as <var>! You're right, that does seem to fit it better. Nicely done!
OK! Come see me again if you change your mind.
Done! From now on, this Pokémon shall be known as <var>! It looks no different from before, but we both know this name is vastly superior! How fortunate for you!
Hmmm. <var>! That is a truly impeccable nickname! Take good care of <var>!
Now, now... That is merely an Egg!
