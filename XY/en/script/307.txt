Welcome to Hotel Cyllage.
The Holo Caster was developed at that Lysandre guy's laboratory, right?
So, Team Flare was collecting information about people who use the Holo Caster?
When Pokémon evolve, they seem to release some new kind of energy... That's what Professor Rowan from the faraway Sinnoh region spends his time researching.
Ouaf!
Sleep can cure all of life's problems! You should let your Pokémon get some rest.
Sleep to fully recover HP! Status conditions will be cured, too!
I just love talking in my sleep! You should give it a try, too!
Only Pokémon that are asleep can use Sleep Talk. When the sleeping Pokémon uses it, one of the other moves it knows will go off.
