Hi, Trainer! If you'd like, take this with you!
Some Pokémon like whipped cream, and others like aromas and flavors. It takes all kinds of Pokémon to make the world go round.






If you have a Pokémon hold an item and trade it to someone, you can give your trading partner a nice little surprise.
Know what? Some Pokémon evolve when you Link Trade them with Friends!
