Welcome to the Battle Maison. I'm the receptionist.
What would you like to do today?
What would you like to hear about?
This Battle Maison provides various battles with many Trainers. You can choose from the following battle formats: Single, Double, Triple, Rotation, or Multi Battles. You'll keep battling until you lose, and compete based on how many people you can defeat. Please note that if you lose even once, your winning streak will end, and you'll start from zero again. Every time you defeat a Trainer, we'll give you points called BP. You'll earn more BP as you keep winning, so do your best!
Please note the following three points when you battle in the Battle Maison. First, while you participate in battles here, Pokémon at levels higher than 50 will be reduced temporarily to Lv. 50. Second, please note the number of Pokémon you need for a challenge. You need three Pokémon for Single Battles, four Pokémon for Double Battles, six Pokémon for Triple Battles, and four Pokémon for Rotation Battles. For Multi Battles, each Trainer needs two Pokémon. Third, and lastly, all Pokémon and their items should be different. But for Multi Battles, it's OK for two players to have the same Pokémon or item.
We hope to see you again.

I'm the number one apprentice of <var>. I'll do my best, so don't give up on me.
Hey, I know <var>. Well, I'm kinda <var>'s pal! I'll help ya out, but don't drag me down!
Do you know an awesome Trainer named <var>? I'm a friend of the awesome Trainer. Today, I'll lend you my amazing muscle and help you out.
<var>... is my BEST friend... I WILL FIGHT BESIDE YOU... I WILL KNOCK ALL YOUR ENEMIES DOWN...
Hey! I'm a favorite apprentice of <var>, whose name quiets a screaming child! I can't bring disgrace on my teacher, so I'll get psyched up for battle!
Me and <var>? We have a rather ambivalent relationship. We're more than strangers but less than best friends. What kind of relationship will you and I have? Anyway, let's do our best together!
<var> and I are kindred souls... A pleasure to meet you.
I'm <var>'s best friend! I'll lead you to victory so I won't disgrace my friend's name.
Eek! If I report this kind of result to <var>, I'll be in trouble.
That's too bad, but these things happen! <var> would say so and laugh it off!
Ugh... I'm so ashamed... I'll start my training with <var> over from the beginning.
GRR... I'M FED UP. I'm going BACK to <var>'s place...
Argh... I'm so sorry... My teacher, <var>...
Ahh. That's too bad. Well, even with a poor result, I'm sure <var> will cheer me up, so I'm OK.
Gah... Bitterly disappointing... <var>... Sorry...
I'm too embarrassed to face <var>! Please start the next challenge already! We'll start winning next fight!
We...we...can challenge the Super Multi Battles! I'll let <var> know the result!
We cleared the Multi Battles! Haha! We did it! I should go brag about this to <var>!
We made it mainly because of me... You should thank me, of course. I'm going to tell <var> about this.
You're STRONG! You're GREAT! You're HALF as good as <var>!
You're seriously awesome! I wanna battle with you again! I respect you as much as I respect <var>!
Yay! I owe it all to you! Well, I'm gonna go to <var>'s place to brag about this!
You and I... Our two spirits led us to this answer...
You were as strong as <var>! I wouldn't mind teaming up with you again!
Eh? Eh? Are you leaving? No... What shall I...
Do you have some errands to run? Oh well. Let's battle together again!
So, we're stopping here this time? All right. See you again...
YOU GO HOME... I GO HOME...
Well, that wasn't bad! Guess we should lay off of them for a bit.
What? Is that all? I could keep fighting!
Are you exhausted body and soul? OK, then, next time...
What's the matter? We're on a roll! Do you have to go to the restroom?
You and I have very different goals, but if we come together and click, nobody can beat us!
We didn't really click, did we? Did our egos get in the way of understanding what the other wanted to do?
It's exactly because we're so different, that when we click, both of us have a power and style we don't have when we're alone.
That's OK, I guess... It's a shame, but let's call it quits.
If we both respect one another and do our very best, no one will be able to beat us!
The battle may not have turned out great, but I tried my best to get to know you better.
I really like fighting as one with my Pokémon and winning battles. I enjoyed working as a team with you to win, too.
All right... Can't be helped, I suppose. Might as well call it good.
If it's with you, <var>, everything is fun! ♪
Oh... I'll do better next time!
<var>, you're really great! Having amazing friends like you makes me feel like I've become great, too!♪
Aww... If you say so...
When I join forces with you, <var>, I feel like we can beat anybody!
Sorry 'bout that! Those cool Pokémon moves might've distracted me from the battle a little...
I saw tons and tons of Pokémon moves! I've had my fill for now!
Hey what? Done already? Some other time, then, 'K?
<var>. Let me demonstrate the knowledge I've gained from filling up the Pokédex.
I've heard it a lot, but... It's one thing to know something, but it's another thing entirely to put it to good use...
<var>, you really know a great deal about Pokémon. Actually, that's not why you're good, is it? I'm sure the real reason you're such a great battler is that you're kind to Pokémon.
Oh? Done already? And I thought we were just about to really get going, too...
Sigh... I do Sky Battles only. If there were no roof, I could take on the challengers, too...
The second floor is a viewing area for people who don't battle. I'm watching battles and guessing who will make it to the end.
I'm just watching battles with my girlfriend. Challengers like you don't know this, but spectators have to pay an admission fee.
Have you already met the four Battle Chatelaines? They're the owners of the Battle Maison. They're four strong yet elegant sisters! If you keep winning in battles, they'll appear in front of you! My favorite Chatelaine is, of course, the first daughter, Mademoiselle Morgan, who specializes in Rotation Battles! No one else! The minute you see her, I guarantee that you'll feel the same way!
Hisssss
Huh? Do you want me to restore your Pokémon's health? ...Listen. As you can see, I'm taking a day off today. Once I leave the Pokémon Center, I'm an ordinary girl, OK? I'm quite stressed out from work. Today, I'm letting the stress out by watching battles. When I go back to work, I'll do my job, so please leave me alone today, OK?
Ugh...ugh... My muse, Mademoiselle Evelyn, won't show up on the stage... If I can't see her dainty face, my fingers won't dance on the cash register tomorrow... You! You're a Trainer, right? Please keep winning in Double Battles! I can't go home unless I see Mademoiselle Evelyn, who flourishes on the stage!
Perfect combinations between strong Trainers and Pokémon. Pokémon battles here are serious battles.
I...I...want to be... <var>'s apprentice. I'll do my best and battle it out, so, um...thank you in advance for your guidance.
I wanna be <var>'s pal. Anyway, let's do our best today!
I'm training every day to be <var>'s friend. Today, I'll battle here instead of training.
I think I can be <var>'s BEST friend. But today, I will battle with YOU...
My dream is to be <var>'s apprentice! Today, I use this battle as training and do my best!
I want to have a close relationship with <var>. If I do well here, I might get noticed. So, I'll get psyched up!
I'm feeling that <var>'s and my minds are connected... I feel the bond between us... Even now, I feel I can hear <var>'s voice, saying "Fight..."
I believe that <var> and I will be best friends very soon. I will lead you to victory so I won't disgrace my future friend!
Hee... I can't be <var>'s apprentice with such a result.
With such a pathetic result, <var> won't approve me as a pal.
Ahh... This is terrible... With such a result, <var> won't accept me as a friend...
ARGH... I'm tired... <var>... I'm hungry...
I want to be strong just like <var>.
I wish I could be strong like <var>...
I feel <var>'s soulful voice saying, "Go home..."
<var>... I'm too embarrassed to face my future friend.
We...we can now challenge Super Multi Battles! I wonder if <var> will accept me as an apprentice!
We cleared Multi Battles... I think we can be a good team.
Not only my great performance but also <var>, who's probably cheering for me, brought this awesome result...
I am as strong as <var>, RIGHT?
Teacher, <var>... Were you watching me?
I guess this is the result that I can brag about to <var>.
I can hear <var>'s soulful voice saying, "Congratulations..."
I wonder if <var> accepts me as a friend.
Eh? Eh? Are you leaving? No... What shall I...
Do you have some errands to run? Oh well. Let's battle together again!
Are we going to stop here? All right. See you again...
YOU GO HOME... I GO HOME...
Well, that wasn't bad! Guess we should lay off of them for a bit.
What? Is that all? I could fight more!
Are you exhausted in body and mind? OK, then, next time...
What's the matter? We're on a roll! Do you have to go to the restroom?
Here she comes, Battle Chatelaine Nita!
Here she comes, Battle Chatelaine Evelyn!
Here she comes, Battle Chatelaine Dana!
Here she comes, Battle Chatelaine Morgan!
Here they come, Battle Chatelaines Evelyn and Dana!
Here they come, Battle Chatelaines Morgan and Evelyn!
Here they come, Battle Chatelaines Morgan and Nita!
