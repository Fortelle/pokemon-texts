Welcome at last, dear Trainer. As you must know, I am the Champion, Diantha.
Oh, but you are... You're the child I spoke to in Lumiose City and Coumarine City, aren't you?! Then that means that you are also the one that dear Augustine said... Of course! How could I--?! Oh, I must look like such a fool not to recognize you sooner! You and your Pokémon are the ones who stopped Team Flare for us all!
It seems wrong of me to say this, but thank you! You saved us all... I can't wait to see what you and your Pokémon are capable of now that I know exactly what it is you've done already!
I-I'm so choked up that it's hard to know what I should say, but I...I... I'm just so glad at this moment that I was good enough to be the Champion...
After all, it gave me the chance to meet and battle with you and your wonderful Pokémon!
Now I understand why dear Augustine-- Professor Sycamore--said he needed to get Lumiose City ready for the new Champion. But before I take you there... My dear <var>, would you mind coming this way with me?
Now I understand just why dear Augustine--that's Professor Sycamore to you--said he had to get everything ready for the new Champion! He'll be waiting for us in Lumiose City, but before I take you there... My dear <var>, would you mind coming this way with me?
Oh, welcome back! I've been hoping that you would visit again!
Battling against you and your Pokémon, all of you brimming with hope for the future... Honestly, it just fills me up with the energy I need to keep facing each new day! It does!
That positive hope for the future and the warm feelings that fill your heart... Those things can never be exhausted. They will never run out. Not ever. If you just find a way to share them with others, I know you'll have a happy life.
Come along, my dear <var>... You know where we're going next.
