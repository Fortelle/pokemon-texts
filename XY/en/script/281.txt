Oh?
You must be <var>, then. Sycamore told me you would be coming. I'm called the Mega Evolution guru. I guess you could say I'm an acquaintance of his. Oh, but Mega Evolution guru isn't my real name, of course. Now, come here for a moment, will you?
Hm? Only one of you? I thought he gave five kids a Pokédex.
Isn't there anyone else with you?
Oh!
Who's that you're talking to, <var>?
People call me the Mega Evolution guru!
Uh, my name is Tierno.
And that's <var> over there.
My name is Trevor.
Pleased to meet you, Sycamore's pupils! But there are still only three of you, huh?
What's this, now? Were you the one who found that Intriguing Stone?
Yes, it was me.
It was given to me.
Yep, sure was.
What?! Uh, it was you who found it, RIGHT, <var>?
Nothing good comes from lying! Were you REALLY the one who found that Intriguing Stone?
Well, who found it doesn't really matter. What's important is that you were honest. If you tell lies, the truth is clouded and eventually lost... And while we're being honest, that Intriguing Stone is just an ordinary rock.
Hm? Sure a lot of hubbub out there. Does that mean everyone has arrived?
Hey there! So you made it to Shalour City! Lucario is in its Poké Ball, but it's really happy to see you! Well, we should go see what's going on, too!
