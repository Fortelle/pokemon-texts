Hello! Welcome to the Lumiose Transportation Office.
We provide information on transportation in Lumiose City so you can enjoy a safe and comfortable city life.
Is there anything else I can help you with?

Not really
Lumiose City is a big city where many people and Pokémon gather, and there are many facilities, too. It can be hard to get around in the city... That's when our transit options, the Gogoat Shuttle and the Lumi Cab, come into play!
You can ride on the back of a Gogoat and move between South Boulevard and North Boulevard. You can enjoy slow, relaxing, and leisurely sightseeing while admiring the great view of the city!
It's a high-speed taxi that zips you to the place you want to go. It may be a bit expensive depending on your destination, but if you want to go somewhere fast, the taxi is a perfect means of transportation for you!
The TMV is the super high-speed rail that connects Lumiose City and Kiloude City. As the name suggests, it will zip you to the faraway Kiloude City at an astonishing speed!
The Lumiose Transportation Office provides support 24 hours a day. Please visit us anytime!
...But I'm terribly sorry. We've suspended the operation due to the power outage in Lumiose City and maintenance.

I'll raise these Pokémon with strict discipline in hopes they'll grow up and move around Lumiose City together!
