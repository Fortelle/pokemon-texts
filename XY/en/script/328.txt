Please enjoy Sushi High Roller's famous rolling dance show!
Dance and sushi! Let's roll!
Come up and sushi me sometime.
I heard the owner's family also runs a sushi restaurant. Apparently, at their restaurant, the sushi goes round and round.
Twee-twee-tweet!
Mmm, a harmony of savory spices and rice... It's like there's a party in my mouth!
Oh... What dee-lish food they serve here!
In your opinion as the company president... Don't you think the moves the girls on staff here use are a little harsh?
You may be right, Mr. Chairman... They are pretty tough, but it's all good.
Everything is perfect!
Ya see, kid... This "sushi" stuff is the best.
Yep. The food is fantastic and the servers are sublime! For a gourmand like myself, this is paradise!
Hey! Hey hey hey!
This restaurant is for selected VIPs only! A little greenhorn like you isn't welcome in a place like this! Get on! Vamoose! If you don't scram, I'll throw you out myself. If you don't like it, get famous and then come back!

Heey! Wait just a minute!
Pourquoi?
Bobby, I appreciate your passion for your work, but please let this kid in. That child is actually the Champ... And a celebrity that has no small amount of influence in Lumiose. In other words, a VIP that is more than welcome in our restaurant.
Yessir!
As you see, from today on, you're free to come and go as you wish. We will, of course, still charge you, but we appreciate your continued patronage.
Hey, greenhorn! How are you doing?
