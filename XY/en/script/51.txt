Oh, would you look at that! You've got on a pair of Running Shoes, my young friend! I can't see a pair without thinking of the old jingle they used to play in their commercials... "To dash, dash, dash! In a flash, flash, flash! Press the B Button to dash in a flash!" Yeah, just press that B Button!
If the time comes, I hope I can entrust my son with a Pokémon. Going out on a Pokémon journey really helps you mature, you see.
