When a Pokémon is evolving and you don't want it to, try pressing the B Button! It surprises the Pokémon and makes it stop evolving. That's Evolution cancellation!
If you love your Pokémon, even if it changes its appearance, you'll stay connected with it. Let's see, you and <var> are...
Very connected to each other! That's what it looks like to me!
Just getting to know each other... Yes, I think that's how I'd put it.
Capable of understanding each other much more than now. Look forward to that, OK?
