Oh! Hey there, <var>! Are you here to get your Pokémon healed, too?
Pokémon Centers sure are great. You can talk to the lady at the counter and have her heal your Pokémon. And you can even deposit Pokémon you've caught in that PC! Know how Pokémon are sent to a PC when you've caught more than you can carry? That's where they go!
Oh yeah, <var>! There's a Poké Mart in the back of a Pokémon Center. It's a good idea to stock up on Poké Balls and Potions and stuff at the Poké Mart, too.
Pokémon are easier to catch if you make them sleep or paralyze them first!
Did you see any Pikachu in Santalune Forest? I really want to become friends with a Pikachu!
I found my Pikachu in Santalune Forest!
Aww, I wanna catch a Pikachu, too! So lucky! Pika, pika, pika!

There's a fitting room in the back there. You can change in a flash!
