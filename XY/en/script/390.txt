The professor is researching Evolution and change. I heard that he learned a lot from Prof. Rowan in Sinnoh when he was young.
I'm developing a tool that will help my research. It's pretty difficult work. Please wait patiently for it to be completed!
Hi, <var>. I developed a tool to facilitate Pokémon research. If you like, please use it. It can double as a test, too.
It's the Pokémon Radar, or Poké Radar for short. Use it in tall grass, and you'll know where Pokémon are hiding. It's a great tool.
And! If you find a Pokémon, it will keep searching for another Pokémon of the same species! There's no guarantee that you can find a Pokémon, though...
The important thing about the Poké Radar is that you can encounter the same Pokémon species over again. As you know, even Pokémon of the same species can have very different characteristics. To research their characteristics, I'd like to collect as much data on the same Pokémon as possible.
I'll let you know what the target Pokémon is for the research of the day. When you have the chance, please help me with my research.
Hi there, <var>. Today's research target is <var>. Thanks!
Hi, <var>. Will you show me the data you've collected on today's research target, <var>?
Oh, you got <var> Pokémon... Thanks.
Oh, you got <var> Pokémon... Great! Thank you!
Oh, you got <var> Pokémon... Very helpful. Thank you!
Oh, <var> Pokémon! This is great. This helps my research a lot. Thank you very much!
This is a thank-you gift!
I counted on you!
There are male Pokémon, female Pokémon, and even Pokémon with unknown genders. Some Pokémon have a different appearance depending on gender.
To become good friends with Pokémon, it's best to be with them all the time. Please use these!
A Pokémon caught with a Luxury Ball will become friendly more easily.
Each Pokémon has a mysterious power called an Ability. Some Abilities have effects during a battle, and some have effects in the field.
I heard that a TV and a washing machine are necessary for research on a certain Pokémon!
It's the record machine that offers details of the Poké Radar research.
<var> turned on the record machine!
