Can't that idiot outside even handle guard duty?
So sorry, but we're not offering tours right now.
With a red suit like that, you must be a member of Team Flare, right? Did you have to take a part-time job at the Poké Ball Factory to pay for that ugly suit?

What?! How dare you mock Team Flare! Mightyena, get them!
I'll take care of this! You go on ahead!
Leave this to me! You go ahead!
I love battles that just don't quit!
I wasn't able to hold on to victory. Your pal just won't quit!
When I beat you, tears will fall from your eyes like Poké Balls rolling down a conveyor!
Even if I lose, more will come--like Poké Balls rolling down a conveyor!
I'm a nameless Team Flare Grunt. I've yet to make a name for myself.
I'm a nameless Team Flare Grunt. And that's all I'll ever be...



I can't help but worry when I lose, though... I mean, I'm kind of a scrub, you know?
Ball! Ball! Poké Ball! Ball! Ball! Ultra Ball!
Whatever! If we steal the Poké Balls, only Team Flare will have Pokémon!
Team Flare is on fire! But I'll stay cool as I take you down!
Aaarrgh! What was that?! Your Pokémon are punks!
We're hard at work making Poké Balls, but there still aren't enough...
Everything's finally back to normal! If you see a Pokémon you want to travel with, make sure to throw a Poké Ball at it, OK?
Hey, do you think it's OK to go have a look around now?
I'm sorry... Team Flare messed everything up. It's not a good time right now.
I'm afraid not. It's not the time for that now. They still have to clean up after Team Flare.
Team Flare? Have I heard that name somewhere?
Would they be the people in the red suits from a minute ago?
That's right, Trevor. Team Flare... ... ...
Right. Team Flare... ... ...
They took all of the Poké Balls by force? But they're for everybody to use!
How awful... It seems like it would be best not to get involved with those guys.
You're right, Trevs. Team Flare sure is terrible. What should we do now? According to the Town Map, Dendemille Town is next...
<var>! You and Serena are really awesome! You're way stronger than those bad guys! Still, try not to do anything crazy, OK? See yaaa!♪
<var>! You and Calem are really awesome! You're way stronger than those bad guys! Still, try not to do anything crazy, OK? See yaaa!♪
Thank you. Everyone's OK, thanks to you! But if I keep relying on you like this, going on this journey will lose its meaning...
Thanks. Everyone's OK, thanks to you. But if I keep relying on you like this, I won't grow during my journey.
The direction of the conveyor has been reversed!
