As you can see, Route 17 is completely covered in snow! It's like this all year round. People usually ride on the back of a Mamoswine to plow their way through to the other side. But unfortunately, the Mamoswine is hanging out in front of the Frost Cavern and won't budge...
On the back of a Mamoswine, you can smash any rocks in your way!
Ahoy there, Trainer! Shortly after you headed off to the Frost Cavern, Mamoswine came back. Did something happen over there?
They were trying to use Abomasnow as some kind of energy source? I wonder if that's the same Abomasnow as the one that our Mamoswine is friends with... See, a few years back, an Abomasnow came into town carrying a Mamoswine that was all beat up and injured from something...
I wonder if Mamoswine was worried about its pal...
Trainer, you should ride on Mamoswine's back to the other side! This deep snow and all the rocks along the path are nothing against Mamoswine's strength!

Route 17 Also known as Mamoswine Road
