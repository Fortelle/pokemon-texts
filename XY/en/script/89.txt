Oh! Hi, <var>!
Come learn how to catch Pokémon with me!
Serena's mom and dad are amazing Trainers! That's why she knows so much about catching Pokémon and battling.
Calem's mom and dad are amazing Trainers! That's why he knows so much about catching Pokémon and battling.
Well... Mom and Dad may be good, but that has nothing to do with me. OK, now watch carefully, you two.
You can talk about my parents if you want, but it doesn't have anything to do with me. I'm going to show you how to catch one now, so watch carefully!
Wow! The Pokémon went INSIDE the Poké Ball?!
Shauna... What do you think your <var> is inside of right now? Here, I'll share some Poké Balls with the two of you.
Seriously, Shauna? Did you forget already? Your <var> is in a Poké Ball, right? Anyway, I'll share some Poké Balls with you two.
Poké Balls! ♪ Do you think I can catch Pokémon with them, too?
Sure. You can catch the Pokémon around here just by throwing a Poké Ball near them.
If you throw a Poké Ball at a Pokémon around here, you'll probably catch it.
OK! If I find a cute Pokémon, I'll throw lots of Poké Balls at it, and then we'll become friends! ♪
When you catch a wild Pokémon, it makes your Pokémon stronger, too. Good luck!
Catching a wild Pokémon makes your Pokémon stronger, too. Be seeing you.
