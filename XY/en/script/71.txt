Hey there, travelin' Trainer! You look like someone who'd be interested in goin' fishing to find some underwater Pokémon. I just so happen to have a spare rod right here. Whaddya say?
I knew you'd be back! The allure of findin' some new Pokémon underwater is just too great! So, you wanna use my spare rod to go fishing?
Yeah!
Not now.
One Super Rod, comin' right at ya! Go on out there and give it a try!
Don't be shy, now! Surely you've got plenty of room to carry a Super Rod along with you.
Ever heard of consecutive fishing? It's when you successfully reel in a Pokémon multiple times in a row! It just so happens that I'm a consecutive- fishing pro! They call me the General! My current best is seven times in a row! Pretty impressive, huh? I tell you what--if you somehow manage to beat my record, I'll give you some Dive Balls!
Let's see... Your best consecutive fishing record is...<var> times! Let me tell you the trick to fishing. It's all about finding narrow areas that don't stand out much. Maybe they'll be surrounded by walls or rock formations. Those are the kinds of spots where you'll find lots of Pokémon!
Let's see... Your best consecutive fishing record is...<var> times! Well, I'll be! You've gone and matched my record! My hat goes off to you! You might have what it takes to beat my record. Keep on fishing, now!
Let's see... Your best record for consecutive fishing is...<var> times! What incredible skill! They call me the General, but I've got nothin' on you! Don't let it be said that I'm not true to my word! Here are some Dive Balls, as promised! Twenty of 'em!
This is just a rumor, but word is that you can catch some rare Pokémon through consecutive fishing! Keep on fishing, now!
There she is! My successor to the title of the General! Your best record for consecutive fishing is... <var> times! This is just a rumor, but word is that you can catch some rare Pokémon through consecutive fishing! Keep on fishing, now!
