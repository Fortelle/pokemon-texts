Hey, <var>!
If you use the move Flash, not as many wild Pokémon will turn up.
I kinda depend on Flash. I'm still not very good at battling, so I keep running into trouble... I sure wish I could be as good as you.
Check the condition of your Pokémon before deciding whether to go back or press onward.
If your Pokémon are in good health, press onward. If they're not, it's time to rest and recover!
