The Pokémon League is the place where you challenge the Elite Four, known as the strongest Pokémon Trainers, and the Champion who reigns over them!
I'll give you a Quick Ball, so catch a Pokémon that can learn an HM!
Defeating the Champion is one step to growing stronger. Well, I guess I should wait to say that after defeating the Champion.
Is adapting to any opposing Trainer the sign of real strength? Or is strength more about staying true to my own style?
