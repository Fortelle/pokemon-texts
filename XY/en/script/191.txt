Is something wrong in the Frost Cavern, Mamoswine?
Swi swi...
Are you headed to the Frost Cavern, Trainer?
This Mamoswine here usually can't get enough of giving people rides on Route 17, but... These days, it seems to be too worried about something in the Frost Cavern to give rides.
Mamoswine is a Pokémon that loves cold climates. So, maybe it has sensed something amiss in the Frost Cavern.
And you are?
My name is Trevor. I'm researching the distribution of Pokémon in the Kalos region at Professor Sycamore's request.
I see. So that's why you're walking clear out to the Frost Cavern, then. Mamoswine seems concerned about something over there, so be careful.
I will. Thank you.
What are you going to do, <var>? I'm going to prepare for my expedition.
Frost Cavern Ahead
