In this facility, you can go on the Safari of a Friend registered in your friend list. The kinds of Pokémon you can encounter on a particular Safari do not change, but different Pokémon appear on each Safari. There will be a different Safari for each friend code registered to your Nintendo 3DS system. So come here after making lots of Friends. If your Friend is playing Pokémon, more Pokémon will pop up in his or her Safari. It's a nice little bonus.
Please choose the Friend Safari you want to go on.
You don't have any friends registered, so there are no Safaris to go on.
Have a nice time!
We're looking forward to your next visit.
