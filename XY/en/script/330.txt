Hello. How are you and your Pokémon?
Even if Pokémon are of the same species, each Pokémon has different strengths.
If people raise Pokémon, they will get stronger than wild Pokémon.



A parallel swizzle is a very cool technique in which you swing your body left and right and skate as if you were dancing. Slowly move the Circle Pad in the direction you're traveling.
There are other cool skaters in Lumiose. Talk to them, and you'll enjoy roller skating even more!
I'm trading Pokémon by Link Trade now.
A Pokémon has arrived! Wow! It's even holding an item!
