Hi! Guess what! I heard that some Pokémon can evolve during a battle! Did you know that?
There are lots of stones that can bring out new power in Pokémon. The Kalos region just so happens to have a lot of stones. That makes me think that anything could happen here.

I'm very particular about the Speed of Pokémon!
That's why I'm wondering if you have any Pokémon with a Speed of <var> or greater with you!
Your <var> is fast! Just like I like them! That makes me really happy, so I'll give you this!

There are many different Pokémon with many different Speeds! ♪ If you'd like, please come visit me again tomorrow, OK?
Worry not! There's more to Pokémon than Speed. But what I'd really like to see today is a Pokémon with Speed greater than <var>!
