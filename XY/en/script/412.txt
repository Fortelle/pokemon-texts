Oho! A new face in town! Yes, indeed! Take this with you on your way.
Oh, and take this as well.
Yes, they are for Pokémon battles! By knowing which items to use during the right moment in battle, a Trainer can save his or her partner in a pinch!
Type matchups, huh? So, Water is good for Fire, and Fire works well against Grass... And Grass is strong against Water--right!
You've got your Pokémon holding items like you know what's going on, right?
Moves have types, too, you know? If your Pokémon uses a move that's the same type as the Pokémon, that move's power will go up!
Even if you catch a wild Pokémon, your team's Pokémon will still grow. I know it because one of my Pokémon leveled up when it was fighting a battle like that!
The whiteboard explains Pokémon status changes that can occur in battle.
What do you want to read about?
If a Pokémon is poisoned, it will steadily lose HP when battling. The poison won't disappear after the battle either. To cure it, you will need to use an Antidote.
Paralysis reduces the Speed stat of a Pokémon and may prevent it from making any moves. Paralysis also lingers after battle, so use a Paralyze Heal to free your Pokémon from it.
If a Pokémon falls asleep, it will be unable to attack as long as it is sleeping. The Pokémon may wake up on its own, but if the battle ends while it is sleeping, it will stay asleep. You can wake it up using an Awakening.
A burn reduces a Pokémon's Attack stat and steadily reduces its HP. It will remain after battle. You can cure a burn using a Burn Heal.
If a Pokémon is frozen, it becomes completely helpless--it won't be able to do a thing. The Pokémon may thaw out on its own, but if the battle ends while it is frozen, it will stay frozen. Thaw it out using an Ice Heal.
