Greetings, sirmiss. This is the gate to Route 16.
Get this! I saw some giant walking around! He must have been over nine feet tall! I heard a tale about him, too! They say he's been wandering around for 3,000 years in search of a certain Pok√©mon!
Maybe it's because of the way they sway about, but little Espurr here is always clawing at my sleeves!
Myaow myaow!
Anyone who's cool enough to be able to go to Route 15 can pass right on through!
Do you know about Route 15? Numerically, it's right in between Route 14 and Route 16...
