Oh, if it isn't <var>. What is your title in the nobility? What? You don't have a title?! That's a surprise. No one could doubt that a kid as strong as you should have one.
See, your title here at the Battle Chateau shows everyone just how strong you are. Only a handful of Trainers can join the ranks of the nobility and earn these titles!
Lady Viola, are you acquainted with the young gentlemanlady? Ahh, I see you carry the Bug Badge, young sirmiss. It appears that Lady Viola has recognized your ability as a Trainer, then.
It is a pleasure to meet you, my lordady. My name is Hennessy. Might I ask your name? ... ... ... SirLady <var>? A fine name.
I will gladly recommend <var>, so will you grant himer a beginning title? HShe has the makings of a very strong Trainer, so I'm sure she will contribute to the Battle Chateau.
Of course, ma'am! If you are willing to speak for himer, Lady Viola, then that is more than sufficient. And besides... I, too, sense extraordinary potential emanating from young SirLady <var>.
Sir <var>! You are hereby granted the title of Baron!
Lady <var>! You are hereby granted the title of Baroness!
<var> received the title of Baron!
<var> received the title of Baroness!
Trainers with noble titles can do battle against other Trainers with titles in the nobility here at the Battle Chateau. The title of Baron or Baroness places you at the lowest rank of nobility. Continue to battle here, and your victories will increase your rank and your title. Then it's likely that higher-ranking members of the nobility will appear in hope of fighting you, sir.

If you ever have any questions, please direct your inquiries to the two clerks at the door. Well then, SirLady <var>, Lady Viola. I will take my leave now.
I'm also a member of the nobility, so let's battle again if we get the chance!
Oh my! You have come at a fantastic time, Sir <var>. All those with the title of Duke or Duchess have discussed the issue and come to a decision...
