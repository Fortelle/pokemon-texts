You can't pick items up from the ground while on the back of a Skiddo! T'would be poor manners, after all.
I love Skiddo so much, I feel like I've been hit with the Attract move! Here--take this TM so you can see how I feel!
When a Pokémon is under the effects of Attract, its chance of failing an attack against a Pokémon of the opposite gender goes way up!
