Huh?
Huh?
Huh.
Huh?
I've seen this kid somewhere before.
So who is she?
I have no idea. But obviously she's not in Team Flare. Let's get himer, yeah?
Yup. That sounds good to me. Then I'll get in the first blow!
Oh! What a brute! Look at poor Celosia!
What's this?! Who would have thought a child like you could beat us both? You and your Pokémon were utterly in sync in that battle, and I know why. You're here for answers, aren't you? I suppose we're at your mercy. I will tell you what I know, at least.
We've been using the electricity we stole from the Power Plant to get everything prepared for activating the ultimate weapon. But it's not like that's all we'll need to use it. Are you following me? We'll need energy absorbed from Pokémon to power the device! Yes! It's the stones on Route 10 that will steal that energy for us and power the ultimate weapon!
That's right. The stones on Route 10 normally put out energy, but when the ultimate weapon is activated, that reverses and they begin to absorb energy from Pokémon!
In reality, those stones that line Route 10 are the graves of Pokémon. When the ultimate weapon was used to end that horrible war over 3,000 years ago, it stole the lives of all those Pokémon. Their lives were the price of peace then. And if we want to make our own wishes come true today, we in Team Flare also have to sacrifice something precious.
One of the mysterious stones you saw alongside Route 10...
Can this stone really be used to absorb a Pokémon's energy?
