Hey!
Hey, how's it going, friend? I'm Mr. Bonding, the expert on O-Powers.
Let me ask you just in case! Do you need to hear an explanation about O-Powers?
O-Powers! They're mysterious forces! If you use them, good things will happen. For example, Pokémon will get stronger or you will get more prize money. Some O-Powers allow you to share good things with friends around you. They're wondrous things that nurture bonds!
Hey! That's my friend!
Let's get started, shall we? It's bonding time!
You received an O-Power from Mr. Bonding.
You can now use <var>!
Sp. Atk Power increases the Sp. Atk stat.
Sp. Def Power increases the Sp. Def stat.
Prize Money Power increases prize money from battle.
Speed Power increases the Speed stat.
Critical Power increases the critical-hit ratio.
Befriending Power makes Pokémon grow friendly more easily.
Encounter Power increases the chance of encountering wild Pokémon.

You can buy items cheaply at Poké Marts with Bargain Power.
Exp. Point Power increases the Exp. Points from a battle.
Stealth Power decreases the chance of encountering wild Pokémon.
PP Restoring Power restores the PP of the lead Pokémon when you use it.
You can use O-Powers from the PSS, and the more you use them, the higher they level up! So use them as often as possible!
Well then, I do believe I shall take my leave right about now. Hope to see you around!
