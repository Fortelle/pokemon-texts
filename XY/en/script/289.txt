I was invited out the other day by a friend who recently joined up with Team Flare. He just kept going on about how only Team Flare had a future to look forward to...
Team Flare, huh? They stashed tons of cash and food and stuff in their secret HQ. That's what my friend who joined up with Team Flare told me, anyhow...
There exists an item that can change a Pokémon's Ability! Well, that's what I heard, but where do I actually find one?
Oh, what's that you have there? That's a Kalos Pokédex, isn't it? Let me have a look for a moment. In Coastal Kalos you've seen... <var> Pokémon! Let me know when you hit 40. I'll prepare a little treat for you.

An Eviolite is quite a handy item. Would you believe what it does? It raises the Defense and Special Defense for a Pokémon holding it. But I'm afraid there is one catch. It only works for Pokémon that can evolve, but haven't finished evolving. Mysterious, isn't it?
