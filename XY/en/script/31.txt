Welcome to Hotel Marine Snow, located right here in cozy Geosenge Town--the town of stones!
And where might you be from? ... ... ... ... ... ... Is that right? All the way from Vaniville Town? Well, it's a pleasure to have you here!
I think your <var> is great, too!
It makes me happy when other people like the same Pokémon as me! I get curious about people who like different Pokémon than I do.
H...hello.
You saw those huge stones on Route 10, didn't you? Some of the bigger ones are more than 30 feet tall! And there are hundreds of millions of them, spanning more than a mile in all!
I suppose it's possible that people put up those stones with help from lots of Pokémon, but for what purpose? Why are they there?
There are lots of theories about them, of course. Some people think they mark the burial site of warriors from ancient times. Others say they were built as family memorials or that they were set up for a ritual to celebrate life.
I don't know about all that, though. Personally, I think they might just be a kind of calendar. You see it all the time in astronomy studies. Ancient cultures used stones to track the movement of the sun.
One thing is for sure--those stones are full of mysteries. Many believe that they contain some kind of mysterious power. I just hope it's a benign power that is watching over us people and Pokémon. Speaking of which, there are some mysterious stones in the neighboring Shalour City, too.
The stones were there to absorb energy from Pokémon? I guess the theory about them being gravestones wasn't too far off! Thankfully, they were destroyed, which means no Pokémon have to worry about their energy getting stolen now!
Ouaf!
