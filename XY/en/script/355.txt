The more Pokémon that you trade, the more Pokémon you'll have with different IDs! In other words, the better your chances at winning the Loto-ID! I'm a genius, right?
Don't duck away! Just take a pluck. Try your luck! Come every day! That's the Loto-ID way! ☆
I've been training nonstop to win the Loto-ID! What's that? You say no one can train for that?
I like to sit here and watch the wild gamut of emotions from the people playing the Loto-ID.
I've come all the way out from Azure Bay today, just so that I could try the Loto-ID!
