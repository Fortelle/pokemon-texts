You know what this place is? Welcome to the Pokémon Village. This place is a secret, y'know?
Most of the Pokémon here are runaways--escaped from bad people who did awful things to them. It's a shame how many heartless Trainers who can't bother to care for their Pokémon are out there. Some of these Pokémon, though... Some of 'em are just too strong and found they didn't really have a place in the outside world, so they came here.
Hmm... I see. Your Pokémon sure seem to think highly of you. You've had some good times together, haven't you?
Hey! You all can come out now. This one's all right!
Sometimes I get worried and come here to check on everyone. Oh--excuse my manners. We haven't even had a proper introduction yet. The name's Wulfric. I'm usually over at the Gym in Snowbelle City, since I'm the Gym Leader and all. Let me guess--you want to challenge me?
That's right.
Not really.
I thought so. Sorry to inconvenience you like this. I'll be waiting for you back at the Gym, then. Before you come by, I think it would do you good to spend some time with the Pokémon here.
Now you're just being modest. You have seven Badges already, haven't you? There's only me left to challenge, so I'll be waiting for you back at the Gym. Before you come by, I think it would do you good to spend some time with the Pokémon here.
Oh! The Pokémon has something in its mouth.
Bouaf!
Fouaf!
Fwa!
Mya myaow!
Oh! The Pokémon has something in its mouth.
Chi-chiirp!
A Snorlax lies deep in slumber. Looks like it's having some good dreams!
This is the Unknown Dungeon! Some terrifyingly strong Pokémon have made their homes in here! Only recognized Champions of the Pokémon League are allowed to enter!
