The Double Battle meal at our restaurant is a three-course series: three Double Battles in a row. Our food is only served when it's perfectly ready, so we hope you'll enjoy battling as you wait. If you win each battle within the number of turns we specify, I'm sure you'll find your meal superb. And in case you weren't sure, a turn is defined as any time that a Trainer gives an order.
We're always waiting for your next visit.

The Triple Battle meal at our restaurant is a four-course series: four Triple Battles in a row. Our dishes need a proper amount of time to cool before they can be enjoyed, so we suggest battling as a pleasant pastime while you wait. To ensure flavor perfection, you must win each battle in the exact number of turns we request. In case you were wondering, a turn is defined as any time that a Trainer gives an order.
We're always waiting for you to come visit us again.
Well, we're always sad any time we have to see you go, <var>. But all of us here on the staff will be waiting eagerly for your next visit!
I see, I see. Yeah. So that's the one? It'll be $<var>... That work for you?
I see, I see. Yeah. So that's the one? No surprise there. You've got taste! It'll be $<var>... That work for you?
OK! We'll have that up for you in no time. Just let me show you to your seat, yeah?
Our Chef will give today's meal his all in honor of your visit, <var>. We hope you'll take your time and enjoy your meal to the fullest, yeah?
Oh, this is really hard to say, but you don't seem to have the cash, yeah?
Bwahahahahaha! Just what I'd expect of you, <var>! Your jokes are always sublime! I'm utterly blown away by your wit, sirmiss! But do humor me... Go ahead and check your funds again, won't you?
Ohhh, yeah, I'm sorry, but... At this restaurant, we require customers to have <var> Pokémon if they want to be served...
Bwahahahaha! Oh, <var>! You always get me! Such a tease! Have mercy on me! You know very well that our diners need at least <var> Pokémon with them!
I apologize for any wait. Here is your entrée, sirmiss. This sprightly Pecha pâté has been likened to a Madame masquerading as a maiden. We recommend that you begin eating in precisely <var> turns. To keep you entertained until then, please join me in battle.
Well, sirmiss, you took <var> turns and <var> of your Pokémon fainted in battle. I was impressed by the refreshing way that you handled your Pokémon! Please enjoy the remainder of the meal at your own pace.
Excuse the intrusion, sirmiss... Here is your hot-soup course. This pottage of sorrowful Custap Berry is topped with Mirror Coat and contains 108 different herbs. We recommend that you begin eating it in precisely <var> turns. To keep you entertained until then, please join me in a Pokémon battle.
Well, sirmiss, you took <var> turns and <var> of your Pokémon fainted! You handled your Pokémon and the battle with genuine artistry. Please enjoy the remainder of the meal at your own pace.
Excuse the intrusion, sirmiss, but I am one of the Owners of this fine restaurant. How are you enjoying your meal so far? I hope it's to your liking. Next is the viande portion of the meal, with our Chef's compliments. A braciole of fresh, Azure Bay Slowpoke Tail. It's accompanied by Payapa Berry crudités glazed in an extra-virgin Oran oil and has been described as the gastronomical equivalent of a Gastly glaring at a Hex Maniac. We recommend that you begin eating it in precisely <var> turns. To keep you entertained until then, please join me in a Pokémon battle.
Well, sirmiss, you took <var> turns and <var> of your Pokémon fainted... It was a masterful performance. I expect that our restaurant's Chef and Owner, the "chef de cuisine," will wish to come out and greet you himself. Please enjoy the remainder of the meal until that time.
Excuse the interruption, good sirfair lady, but I am the "chef de cuisine" and one of the Owners here at Restaurant Le Yeah. I wished to step out and thank you in person for dining with us today. The fromage course, hand selected by myself, will conclude your meal. This is the ultimate in hard cheese, aged up to 180 years. Simply biting into this blue cheese will give off an odor so foul, your nose hairs will burn. Enjoy our washed-rind cheese made using a female Arbok's Toxic poison! We recommend that you begin eating in precisely <var> turns. Please join me in an entertaining battle until then, won't you?
Well, sirmiss, you took <var> turns and <var> of your Pokémon fainted... That was quite the experience... I do hope that you come again. For now, I leave you to enjoy the rest of your meal in peace.
How was your meal? It really hit the spot, yeah? Here is a little dessert to cleanse your palate: Berry sorbet made from fresh Spelon Berries and Rawst Berries, with tangy herbs in a whipped-mousse dressing. Thank you again for dining with us this evening. I will leave your receipt here with you.
So what did you think of the courses this evening? This is a special dessert that we only dish out for you, <var>. Mousse from you-know-where, beside a purée of you-know-what. We do always enjoy your visits! I'll just leave your receipt here with you.

Our meals should only be tasted when perfectly ready, so we hope you'll enjoy battling as you wait. Certain dishes need to settle to be enjoyed at their absolute best. In order to help with this, we have staff to battle and entertain you. If you win each battle in the exact number of turns we request, I'm sure you'll find your meal superb. And in case you weren't sure, a turn is defined as any time that a Trainer gives an order. Please note that all of the many meals at our restaurant consist of five courses and five battles.
We always look forward to your visits, sirmiss.
Of course we understand, <var>... Absolutely no explanation necessary. You are, of course, welcome to come back any time that you wish to do so.
This meal will total to $<var>. Shall we begin the preparations?
I am sure you are aware of our pricing, but... That meal will total to $<var>. Shall we begin the preparations?
A wonderful choice, if I may say so. Allow me to show you to your seat.
A wonderful choice, if I may say so. Allow me to show you to your seat. Please do watch your step, <var>. We don't wish anything to happen to you.
Oh, I understand perfectly, sirmiss... I must admit that it often happens to me, as well. You open your wallet only to find nothing more than a mere $100 inside. Let us just be thankful that we noticed before you had begun your meal, hmm? We won't say another word about it...
Oh, I understand perfectly, sirmiss... I'm sure someone as successful as you must be able to spend money without keeping track of it. How lucky you are for one so young!
SirMiss, I don't wish to criticize your choices in any way, but... In order to fully enjoy that meal, you do need at least <var> Pokémon...
O-of course. However... SirMiss, I don't wish to criticize your choices in any way, but... In order to fully enjoy that meal, you do need at least <var> Pokémon...
Thank you for your patience, sirmiss. I am the Owner of Restaurant Le Wow. Your entrée today will be the ultimate terrine. And here you are, good sirkind lady. This terrine is prepared using a purée of 64 different types of freshly picked Berries, quickly flambéed with a supereffective Flame Burst to bring out the full and native deliciousness of the Berries with a delicate, silky texture. It takes precisely <var> turns for it to be in the absolute prime state for eating. Might I suggest a battle in the meantime?
That was a fantastic effort, sirmiss. Let me take a moment to review... In this Pokémon battle, you used <var> turns and you had <var> Pokémon faint. You and your Pokémon make a lovely combination. My heart is hammering!
Thank you for your patience, sirmiss. I'm sorry to interrupt you once again. For you, I have the soup of the day, a sumptuous consommé. We begin with a vintage 3,000-year-old Rare Bone, boiled for 100 days in pristine snow melted from Kalos's fine Frost Cavern. This allows us to extract every last essence of flavor from its core. It takes precisely <var> turns to bring it to the prime state for eating. Might I suggest a battle?
Hah... Wheeze...wheeze... What a...wheeze...sublime... A sublime... Cough! B-battle... In this...battle, you used <var> turns and you had... <var> Pokémon faint... You and your Pokémon make a... b-breathtaking...combination... I felt as though my heart...might...just...stop... Urgggkkkk...
Thank you for your patience, sirmiss. The Owner has had to respond to an emergency, but I hope I might serve you in his absence. Allow me to introduce your poisson course: a pristinely prepared item in a light velouté sauce, harvested from the coastal ocean near Cyllage City and boiled in the salt water of its sea environment so gently that it barely bubbles in the pot. It will take <var> turns for the heat to spread evenly throughout the dish. Would you care for a battle to help pass the time?
Thank you for joining me for a battle. Let me summarize your efforts, sirmiss. In this Pokémon battle, you used <var> turns and you had <var> Pokémon faint. I felt the same beauty that imbues our dishes in the clean purity of your battle.
I've brought the viande course, sirmiss. Today is a fantastically finished roast. I hope that you will not hold back but will devour it as your primal instincts urge you to. It is just moments from being ready. I could not possibly serve an overcooked meal. You will need to wait <var> turns if you wish to begin it with perfect timing... So...shall we begin?
Thank you for the wonderful battle. Allow me to review your performance. In this Pokémon battle, you used <var> turns and you had <var> Pokémon faint. The merciless way you command a battle is as focused as a Pyroar hunting a Bunnelby.
"Thank you for your patience, sirmiss. May I present the day's fromage?" "This sublime Tomme cheese has been made using the milk of the Skiddo before you." "It will taste its most delicious if you can begin eating it in precisely <var> turns." That's what it says on the paper that the Skiddo appears to be eating...
Oh, sirmiss! I am so terribly sorry! I only looked away for a moment... But in that moment, this Skiddo here dashed away with my crib notes! L-let me summarize your battle... In this Pokémon battle, you used <var> turns and you had <var> Pokémon faint. Please remember our dear Skiddo as you enjoy your fromage!
This dessert will be your final course today... It is our cool and crispy house special: crème brûlée. And your receipt I will leave here with you, sirmiss.
