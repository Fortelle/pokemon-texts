Wow... Shauna's description was spot on!
So, <var>, this is Tierno. He's got some serious dance moves, and...
This is Trevor. He never misses a single question on his tests, but he's a little shy...
So, <var>. This is Tierno. He can really tear up the dance floor...
And this is Trevor. He's a little shy, but he always gets perfect scores on his tests...
All right! Nice to meetcha! You know, it'd feel like we're a closer crew if we call each other by nicknames. Can I call you Lady <var>?
All right! Nice to meetcha! You know, it'd feel like we're a closer crew if we call each other by nicknames. Can I call you <var>-Meister?
What? No way! She's a Li'l <var>, for sure!
What? No way! He's a Li'l <var>, for sure!
What do you think, Trevor?
What?! You want me to nickname someone I just met?! Shauna, you shouldn't put people on the spot like this. Well...how about something low key? Maybe...something like <var>-kins?

Why don't you decide what we should call you?
You should decide what we call you.
You want us to call you <var>?
OK! ♪ <var> fits you perfectly! I'm sure we're gonna be great friends, so I'll call you that, too!
Hey! Can we see the Pokémon now? I want to meet my new partner soon! ♪
I know, right? It was such a cool feeling when Trevs and I met our Pokémon! Hope you feel the same way we did!
<var>, why don't you go ahead and pick first?
<var>, you can pick first.
Hmmmmmm... It's so hard to decide!
What? Seriously? Where are you going? Let's pick our Pokémon!
Are you going to pick a Pokémon?
Here you are, <var>! Which one will be your partner?
OK! It's a big decision. Take some time to think about it.
The two of us have already picked our partners. Pokémon truly are amazing, aren't they?
Would you like to give your Pokémon a nickname?
So, you've decided on the nickname <var>?
So, you're not going to give your Pokémon a nickname? ♪
OK! My partner is <var>! Wow! We go together great! The two of us are just way-ay-ay too cute! ♪
Nice to meet you, <var>. I'm Serena. Because of you, I can be a real Pokémon Trainer. Thank you!
Good to meet you, <var>. My name's Calem. Because of you, I can be a real Pokémon Trainer. Thanks!
Uh, pardon me, but I have something for you from the professor as well. I have something that will help you understand Pokémon on a much deeper level.
<var> received a Pokédex!
Um, so you see... The Pokédex I just gave you is a high-tech device that automatically records the Pokémon you encounter! The reason you get one is because the professor wants us to go on a journey with our Pokémon and complete the Pokédex. To put it another way, it's an important mission from the professor. I'm sure of it!
Oh lighten up, Trevs! You're way too serious sometimes. Um, <var>... Please take this with you, too. It's a letter from the professor. He said you should give it to your mom.
All right! We're done with our errand for the professor. I guess Trevs and I will go look for Pokémon! Let's go, Trevs!
In Kalos, kids are chosen to carry a Pokédex and go on an adventure. But you need to give that letter to your mom before you go.

If you have a Pokémon partner, you have nothing to fear from wild Pokémon.
If you have a Pokémon partner, you can battle wild Pokémon.
My very own <var>! I want to play together soon! With a little one like this with me, I'm sure my journey'll be great! ♪
<var>, wait!
You're gonna be my opponent in my Pokémon-battling debut!
OK, Li'l <var>! It's our first battle! Let's win it with style!
You're amazing, <var>! Here! Let me fix up your Pokémon. ♪
Pretty good! Right, <var>? Here, let me fix up your Pokémon. ♪
Say hi to your mom for me! ♪
Well, I guess I'd better go and battle some wild Pokémon! I have to make my Pokémon strong, after all! ♪
Oh! So you're one of the kids chosen by the professor, are you? You should go home first and have somebody help you prepare for your journey!
Hey there! Looks like you found somebody at home to help you pack! Oh, and make sure you bring a bunch of Poké Balls and Potions, all right?
Hey, Pokémon Trainer! If you set foot in the tall grass, a wild Pokémon will pop out! But you'll be fine, because your Pokémon partner will battle for you!
Do you love Pokémon?
Me, too! Aren't they great?
Hrmph... Well, to each hiser own.
My Pokémon and I are going to train really hard!
I play with my Pokémon and pet it!
