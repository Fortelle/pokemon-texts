The Global Trade Station, or in short, the GTS! With it, you can use an Internet connection to trade Pokémon with Trainers around the world!
Everyone deposits Pokémon into the GTS system, you see. You can search from among them for Pokémon you want.
Hey, listen to this! Even if you have never seen some Pokémon or another yourself, as long as you've at least heard its name... You can just input that name in the GTS to find the Pokémon that way! Awesome, eh?
Grrrwahn!
