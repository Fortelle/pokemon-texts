Hello there! Have you ever heard of a Pokémon called Flabébé?
Wow! You have one with you!
Oh! I see. It's registered in your Pokédex!
That's what I would expect from one of the professor's handpicked Pokémon Trainers!
So, you haven't seen one yet... Well, that's something you can look forward to!
Flabébé is--now brace yourself-- a Fairy-type Pokémon!
Fairy type is a new Pokémon type that was just classified recently.
This turned the entire type-matchup system on its head!
And we've been battling Fairy-type Pokémon against other types of Pokémon at Professor Sycamore's request.
My name's Sina! It's a beautiful name for a beautiful lady!
I'm Dexio. Two years ago, Professor Sycamore entrusted me with a Pokédex. You could call me a Pokémon-voyage veteran.
If you'd like, I'll show you the way to the lab. So, come along now!
OK! Let's get this show on the road!
Oh? Well, don't be shy, OK? Come talk to us when you want to go to the lab.
Perle Fountain Acceptance creates harmony.
