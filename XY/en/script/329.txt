I want my Pokémon to learn moves quickly, so I'm raising my Pokémon without letting them evolve.
When we live aimlessly every day, we sometimes feel so empty that we can't even stand the color of the blue sky. I wonder if Pokémon ever feel like that, too.
I absolutely love Pokémon that I let fight and evolve! At the same time, I absolutely adore Pokémon that haven't evolved yet!
Warmness of Pokémon, warmness of life... When you hug them, you'll feel it... Yes, even when you hug Grimer and Swampert.
