You there! Use this and awaken your Pokémon's hidden powers!
When a Pokémon learns the move Hidden Power, somehow I can tell what type that move will be! Shall I tell you what type of Hidden Power your Pokémon will learn?
Now that I'm aware of my hidden power, I can tell you what type of Hidden Power your Pokémon will learn! Wanna know?
If this Pokémon were to learn Hidden Power, the move's type would be <var>!
The type of this Pokémon's Hidden Power is <var>!
If you want to know, ask me, and I'll activate my hidden power for you!
It's impossible for an Egg to use Hidden Power!
I'm sorry, but this Pokémon can't learn Hidden Power.
