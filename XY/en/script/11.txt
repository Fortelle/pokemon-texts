Hi there, neighbor!
This is Ambrette Town. You just go through the aquarium to get to Cyllage City, but...
First, we should go to the Fossil Lab and have them tell us about Fossils. We might even learn something about those mysterious stones related to Mega Evolution.

Here, Trainer! Use this TM! It's Rock Smash!
Rock Smash may also lower the other Pokémon's ability to defend itself. That makes up for what it lacks in power.
I wonder how strong the Smeargle I left at the Day Care has become. Do you know about Smeargle's move Sketch? It takes the move the other Pokémon used and makes it into its own!

Yo! This is a good deal. Why don't you trade a Poké Ball for my Dive Ball?
Heh, thanks! Enjoy the Dive Ball!
Oh! Seriously? You must be kidding! Don't you have a Poké Ball?!
Oh! Seriously? You must be kidding. Usually people are happy to trade!
See? It's a good deal, innit? We can trade again tomorrow if you want!
Oh! Seriously? You must be crackers. You have way too many Dive Balls!
Handed over a Poké Ball in exchange for the Dive Ball!
