Where is it?
Where could it be?!
My Furfrou!
My beloved little Furfrou has disappeared!
This! Even after I told it not to go outside and get its feet dirty!
It disappeared? Hey, <var>!
We should help look! I mean, if my... If my Pokémon was missing, I'd be sick with worry!
Past this door is the pride and joy of the palace--the too-vast courtyard. You can see the whole garden from the balcony on the second floor.
I feel like I know how the runaway Furfrou feels...
Past this door is a courtyard so fine, even Pokémon find themselves wanting to run around it.
This palace was built after Kalos won a war with neighboring regions. I'll bet a lot of people and Pokémon lost their lives...
I heard of a king from long ago whose garden was his pride and joy. He'd gather the castle folk and hold garden parties!
I feel like I'm in a dream.
Don't try to sleep in the king's bed. It's ir-regal! Ha ha! Hey! Are you trying to use Mean Look on me?
What's special about this place isn't just the beauty of the architecture itself. It's about how the paintings and sculptures work in harmony with the surroundings.
You need a pretty amazing king to build a palace like this.
The person who made this palace must have been very admirable. This entire building has such an elegant, classy atmosphere.
I wonder what the king of the Kalos region thought about Pokémon.
For the owner of this palace, every meal is a feast. If you've never known anything else, a meal like that seems completely normal.
I think it would be so much better if he had a lively dinner with everyone, instead of a full-course meal alone.

It's a statue of a Bisharp general that led a legion of Pawniard.
It's a golden statue of a knight who served to protect this palace.
It's a statue of Milotic, said to be the world's most beautiful Pokémon.
