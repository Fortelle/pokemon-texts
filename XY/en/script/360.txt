I recently moved here from a very rural part of Unova. I feel so lost here. I don't even know what this building is for!
Ouaf ouaf!
Hey, Trainer! Look, my Clauncher's Attack is 100! You got anything that can beat that?
What?! That <var>'s Attack is off the charts! You're some kinda Trainer!
I'm on the PSS right now!
Being able to sit here and pet my precious Spewpa is all I need in life.
Pardon me... But do you happen to know where I might find the Riches? I am looking for young Master Miles.
