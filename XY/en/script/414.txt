If we trade Pokémon, you and I will become acquaintances! So how about it? Why don't you trade a <var> for my <var>?
Beautiful! Then let's trade our precious Pokémon to one another!
So this is your <var>... I will take great care of it!
That one, huh? But what I'm really looking for is a <var>!
Well, that's a shame... If you ever change your mind, I hope you'll come find me!
Pokémon and their Trainers are so connected, it's like two hearts beating as one! When you think of it that way, trading one away is really quite a momentous thing to do!
Hmm? Sorry, my friend, but we can't trade if you only have one Pokémon!
Pokémon that you get from trades tend to grow easily, and they quickly get stronger. But you know, if you don't have enough Gym Badges, they might not listen to your orders!
You there! Were you just thinking, "Boy, there's nothing to buy at the shops around here!"? Then get yourself some Gym Badges! The more you have, the more different things you can buy!
