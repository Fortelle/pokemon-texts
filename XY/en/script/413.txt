I still remember my own first big adventure. I went all the way to the next town with my Pokémon. I'd heard that wild Pokémon jump out at people... I can still feel my heart racing like it was yesterday!
I'm a real grown-up, you see, so I've picked up lots of Great Balls. Here, Mr.iss Trainer. I'm feeling generous, so I'll share them with you.
A Great Ball is just a really great Poké Ball! Get it? It makes it even easier to catch Pokémon!
