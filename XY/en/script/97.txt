Good morning! Welcome to the Pokémon Center. Would you like to rest your Pokémon?
Hello, and welcome to the Pokémon Center. Would you like to rest your Pokémon?
Good evening! Welcome to the Pokémon Center. Would you like to rest your Pokémon?
OK. I'll take your Pokémon for a few seconds, then.
Thank you for waiting. We've restored your Pokémon to full health.
We hope to see you again!

Happy birthday! Please keep visiting the Pokémon Center for many years to come! Now, would you like to rest your Pokémon?

Hello, and welcome to the Pokémon Center. Here we restore your tired Pokémon to full health. Would you like to...
Th-that Trainer Card! That wonderful shade! That sparkle! I've seen several Trainers with Silver Trainer Cards already... But you're the first to top them all with that impressive Trainer Card. Oh, <var>, may I please heal your Pokémon?
Great to see you, <var>! You want the usual, right?
Oh... It looks like your Pokémon may be infected with the Pokérus. Little is known about the Pokérus, except that it is a microscopic life-form that attaches to Pokémon. While infected, Pokémon are said to grow exceptionally well.
Happy birthday to you, <var>!
Many happy returns, <var>! I hope this will be a wonderful year for you!
Oh, <var>! It's a little unusual, but let me say... Happy birthday to you! I know it's a day early still, but I wanted to say it while I had the chance to!
