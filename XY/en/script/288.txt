Let's trade one of your Sitrus Berries for one of my Leppa Berries, shall we?
Thank you! You're a wonderful Pokémon Trainer!
I wish I could fly to the Berry field using the move Fly.
You know what? My one and only psychic power tells me you don't have any Sitrus Berries.
I understand... In this weather, I don't blame you.
Gave a Sitrus Berry in exchange for a Leppa Berry!
What? You have too many Leppa Berries! Even with my psychic power, I couldn't predict that!
Friendship is power! With that in mind, the best way to bring out a Pokémon's hidden power is to become friends with it. Don't you agree?
Mshoo.
