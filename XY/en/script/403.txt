Go talk to the Trainer who's the same number as the right answer!
Buzz! Too bad, so sad! That was obviously the wrong answer! I guess you'll have to fight another Trainer.
Ding-ding-ding! You're correct! Well, aren't you a clever one!
Please stand in the answering area!
Then step into the elevator!
If you want to hear the question again, step on the small panel!
Bird Pokémon, hmmm. Their silhouettes sure do come in all kinds of different shapes... But you think it's Fletchling, do you?
OK, but this is still a Pokémon Gym. It wouldn't seem right if we didn't fight.
So which Pokémon is the correct answer?
To be able to identify a Pokémon by its silhouette is really something.
Oh? You think it's Pidgey?
Let's find out, shall we?
Feel free to take your time...
This is a Pokémon Gym, after all, so we want to test your powers of observation as well.
So Taillow is the answer your love of Pokémon has led you to?
Then let me see just what your love for Pokémon is made of!
It is difficult, isn't it? Give it a good think.
These quizzes are all made to test your love for Pokémon.
