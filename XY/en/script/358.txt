Oh, no one is a no go! This is the Fighting Dojo! How good of you to come! Please, have a look around!
Poor sensei... He came all the way from the Kanto region to open a Fighting Dojo, and this was the only place he could afford to rent. And now he's only getting students to sign up because he's calling it a dance studio!
Hey! Take this!
If you give a Pokémon a Protein, its base Attack stat will go up. You can also increase base stats like Attack and Speed by winning battles!
This is a belt used in karate dancing. Please put it on one of your Pokémon.
It'll make your supereffective moves even more super effective! Nice, huh?
Karate dancing is super fun! Whirl and punch, spin and block!
If I'm going to try to take on Korrina, I've got to start by learning to fight!
Sayings are written on the whiteboard. "No pain, no gain." "It is better to bend than to break."
