There's a lot of garbage today, too... OK, OK, OK...
Hmm?
Oh, hello. I'm a garbage collector. I empty trash cans all over Kalos.
OK, OK. I should go home now. Please let me pass. OK, OK.
The spelling of Vernal is V-e-r-n-a-l, and Estival is E-s-t-i-v-a-l, right?
I was right. Thank you. I'm documenting the facilities in Lumiose City, but spelling is not my strong suit.
Huh? Did I misspell them?
Aah!
Don't speak to me out of the blue! My heart beats so fast that I may fall in love with you!
Wh-what? I haven't fallen in love with you.
Stars shine at night... So I won't work during the day.
People rest at night. So I just loaf around at night.
Taking a rest to do our best! It's very important!
