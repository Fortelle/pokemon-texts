Got to get it to get it! That's the name of my song! Wanna give it a listen?
Well then, sit back with a cup of tea or something, relax, and listen!
I think you're losin' out if you don't hear it...
What did you think of the song? Did it remind you of something?
Thanks! I gave you a song, and you give me a tip! It's a win-win! Come listen again sometime!
You send out three Pokémon at once in both Triple Battles and Rotation Battles. I heard these new battle styles got their start in the Unova region.

Hi! I'll mimic a Pokémon's sound! Please listen!
OK. I'll mimic the sound of a Pokémon you're with...
It's just like the real Pokémon. Won't you listen to me?
I mimicked one of your party Pokémon. Which Pokémon was it?
Correct! You can recognize the sound of Pokémon you always hear, right? Thank you for playing with me. This is a small gift from me!
Correct! Of course, you won't mistake the sound of your partner Pokémon!
Close! Too bad! I'm sad! That was <var>!
...You have way too few Pokémon! I can't give you a quiz like this.
