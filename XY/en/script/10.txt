You can normally ride the Rhyhorn to get to Glittering Cave, but we're giving them a little break.
Oh! Are you going to search for Fossils in Glittering Cave? You'll have to ride on a Rhyhorn to get there in that case! Riding Rhyhorn is so much fun... You can even pretend that you're the famous Rhyhorn racer, Grace!
Pokémon moves that come in direct physical contact with the target are direct attacks. If you want to do something about them, you can try this!
If a Pokémon holding a Rocky Helmet takes a direct attack, the attacker takes damage, too! Combine that with an Ability like Iron Barbs or Rough Skin, and it'll really start to sting!
I like to ride Rhyhorn, too! "Press the A Button to find a way over the clay!" That little ditty will teach you how!
