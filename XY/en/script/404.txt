Ah! You're that Trainer from before! Come straight for a battle, have you? Well, good! You can call me Bonnie. I'm this Gym Leader's younger sister. Go ahead and step onto that small square a few steps directly ahead of you, would you? You will have to answer my questions if you want to get any farther ahead!
Quiz time!
Who's that Pokémon?! 1. Emolga      2. Dedenne 3. Pikachu
Go talk to the Trainer who's the same number as the right answer!
Buzz! Too bad, so sad! That was obviously the wrong answer! I guess you'll have to fight another Trainer.
Ding-ding-ding! You're correct! Well, aren't you a clever one!
Please stand in the answering area!
Then step into the elevator!
If you want to hear the question again, step on the small panel!
Are you sure it's Emolga?
You'll have to beat me to find out if you're right or not!
Please think carefully.
At least there was nothing wrong about your strength!
Dedenne is your answer?
Heh heh...
Think about it lo-o-o-ong and hard, mmm-kay?
I wouldn't be surprised if you answered wrong on purpose, just to battle more.
You've chosen Pikachu?
Let's have a Pokémon battle before we compare answers!
No need for you to rush. We aren't going anywhere.
That was quite the effort!
Which floor would you like to go to?
1F
