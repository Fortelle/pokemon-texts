So you see, I made a Trainer PR Video to remember my journey by. I'll move the hearts and livers of gentlemen with this masterpiece!
Cities...are labyrinths! Seriously, I really get lost in this city!
I was alone when I joined this tour, but I may end it as part of a pair.
Strolling around Lumiose's streets makes you feel like the heroine of a love story. Just being asked for directions can make you feel like meeting that person was destiny...
Hey, c'mon now, you! Don't just stand there spacing out! If you're not going to order anything, scram, will ya?
Hey, hi there, you! I know you! It's because of you more customers are coming 'round here! Eat this croque-monsieur as thanks! It's our specialty!
Tch... Other caf√©s are just buzzing with tourists... All I've got here are cobwebs popping up in the corners!
You're even more of a big shot in Lumiose than I'd heard! Heh heh... Since I told everybody you're a regular, this place has been hopping.
Twee-twee.
