Gobble-gobble! Gobble-gobble-snarf! Amazin'! This is the best food I've ever ate!
I'm trying to tell you how one of the Elite Four is a world-famous chef! I've heard he sometimes meets up with the Gym Leaders Grant and Valerie and treats them to a great meal! Would you stop stuffing your face?!
The food is positively delicious, and the service is impressive--as are the battles. I expect no less from a high-class establishment.
Some things do seem a bit pricey, but that's what makes you feel like it's really high class. It's perfect for ladies like us, who don't hold back when it comes to work, fine dining, or battle.
My Salad is all wilted... Are the ingredients here past their prime?
Owww-wo-wow! The soup! It's scalding! I think I might've burned my mouth!
Grrrr...
Clink... Clatter... Clink... Ahh... I'm sorry about that. I'm here to eat, but you're here to fight, aren't you?
