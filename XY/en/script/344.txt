This caf√© was set up by Furfrou admirers for Furfrou admirers and their beloved Furfrou!
I've never spent more than 218 seconds away from this precious pooch of mine since it came into this world! It is a part of me, and I am a part of it.
What's with that expression? You look mighty confident in how long your Furfrou has maintained its terrific trim.
Of course I am!
Not particularly...
Ohhh! You cheeky little thing! Fine! Then I'll take it upon myself to judge how good you really are!
Gasp! What are you?! Some sort of pro?! ...Fine. Take this.
Sniff! As I thought, you're nothing special. If you want to make me gasp in shock, let's see you keep that trim for <var> days!
Maintaining a perfect Furfrou trim... That is the only true reflection of your love toward your Furfrou in my book!
Hmph. How terribly disappointing. This is all terribly, terribly disappointing.
Feel it! Feel the Furfrou admiration gathering here from all across the Kalos region... We are Furfrou admirers! In short, Furfroumers!
That's right! I keep my precious Furfrou trimmed in the prized Pharaoh style! It shows that I'm a prized customer!
You know, when I leave home every morning, I kiss every one of my 101 Furfrou good-bye.
...What? You want to know why I'm here? Pretty much to see how the other half lives! You can just taste the bourgeoisie in the air!
Whine...
I like natural Furfrou the best.
