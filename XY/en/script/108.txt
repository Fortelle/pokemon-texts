Welcome, challenger, to my Blazing Chamber! I am Malva, and I shall be your opponent today.
Fantastic. Utterly fantastic. I'll report to all the world the news of you and your Pokémon dominating the Pokémon League! I AM a Holo Caster star, after all. Heh, I'm such a busy woman...
Oh, I can't tell you how happy I am to meet you again... I feel like my heart might just burst into flames. I'm burning up with my hatred for you, runt!
Oooh, you wicked little Trainer! You're just too much, you know? You're so amusing that I just want to burn you up where you stand! But I'll let you live... After all... If you want your dreams to come true, you have to be strong enough to force them to happen. Team Flare wasn't strong enough to do that, but I can see that you are.
Three more members of the Elite Four stand between you and the Champion. Take that elevator there to return to the main hall if you're ready for them.
Beat the last two members of the Elite Four, and you can face the Champion.
If you beat the last of the Elite Four, you'll face the Champion.
You'll be facing down the Champion next.
