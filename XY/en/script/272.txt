Hello! I'm the Game Director. Oh? What's this? What's this? Did you obtain every Pokémon to complete the Pokédex?! That's wonderful! Wonderful! I'm so happy that you made such a great effort to obtain so many Pokémon! Please, please, please allow me to present you with this award!
Why, child, look at your Pokédex... How did you obtain so many Pokémon? Obviously, you caught some by yourself, but you can't complete the Pokédex simply by catching Pokémon, right? You probably traded Pokémon with your friends and with people from all over the world to complete it... If that's the case, the Pokédex is not only a wealth of Pokémon information but also a record of your meetings and your communication with others.
I will send this certificate to your house for you!
