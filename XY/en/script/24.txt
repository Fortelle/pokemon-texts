Without our friendly Mamoswine, you won't be able to get over Route 17. But the Mamoswine seems distracted by something in the Frost Cavern...
Bust right through with Mamoswine!
How do you think we people can repay our Mamoswine for all they do for us?
To me, Mamoswine has got to be the easiest Pok√©mon to ride.
Tomorrow is the only thing that comes to you even if you don't do anything. Everything else in life has to be fought for, so go out and get what you want!
