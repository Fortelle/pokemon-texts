Pokémon grow resentful of their Trainers if they're often knocked out in battles...
Oh, if only it could be true... If only you had a Pokémon with Aroma Veil or Flower Veil or even Sweet Veil...
Oh my! Your <var>'s Ability really IS <var>, isn't it! Oh, let me have a little look, won't you? Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. Yes, yes, yes, I see. Mm-hmmmmmm! That is most interesting! Yes, I think I understand everything now. Oh, thank you! You've been a great help!
Combine different Abilities wisely, and you might achieve something fantastic in Double Battles!
I feel, like, totally fulfilled just by having my Pokémon by my side. A world without Pokémon? Pshaw! I can't even imagine livin' like that.
Pangoro is the only living creature in this whole world who really gets me...
Gowf!
