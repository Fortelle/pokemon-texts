No sign of him here either...
You! Have you seen anything?
We're looking for a really tall guy... And I mean tall. If you stretched out a Seviper and stood it up, he'd be that tall. We received some intelligence that Team Flare is also trying to find him for some reason.
His relationship to Team Flare is still a mystery, but...
Oh, by the way, I've got something for you. Take these with you, <var>.
Oh, wait! We met some time ago, but I didn't get your name then! I've never heard your name before! Not once!
Uh... Anyway... We came here--at a certain professor's request--to stop Team Flare! I assume your goal is the same? Don't do anything reckless, OK?
What is that Lysandre guy thinking?! I thought he wanted a beautiful world...
The professor's feeling pretty down, but he's using his network of acquaintances to try to stop Team Flare's plan.
