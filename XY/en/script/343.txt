A round thing is wonderful, isn't it? Because it goes on and on, and it has no end. Do you like round things, too?
Yes
No
I thought so. From any angle, a round thing is round, such as the Pokémon Voltorb. Thus, it has ultimate beauty. I'll give you this as a present.
You're very square.
A round ball rolls in any direction...
I wonder if comfort levels are different depending on the kind of Poké Ball.
If we fail to catch a Pokémon with a Poké Ball, we can't use that Poké Ball again...
Just as I enjoy wearing different fashions, Pokémon must wish they could experience jumping into different Poké Balls!
Hmmeo!
