No one will believe that I saw a huge Gourgeist!
Whoa! That Gourgeist is HUGE! This is huge, too! You can have it!
Poké Balls are so cool! Even huge Pokémon can fit inside!
Some people like big Pokémon, and some people like 'em smaller. Size really comes down to personal preference!
When things look alike, I try to find differences between them. When things look different, I try to find similarities. It's a lot of fun! For example, how many similarities do you think Tynamo and Mothim share with each other?
