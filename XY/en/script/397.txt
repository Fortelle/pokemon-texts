Hey, hello, and welcome! I'm Esse! I'm in charge of the Lost and Found here. I'm guessing here, but I bet you've never visited the lost-and-found desk, huh? Well, basically, my job is to, like, find things that our guests have lost. Get it? The biggest trick is not to step on anything! You've gotta be, like, totally observant!
Hey, hello, and welcome! It's great to see you again!
Hey, hello, and welcome, <var>! You're, like, the swami of searching. The maestro of the missing, even! Anyway, I've been hoping you'd come!
Another guest has gone and lost some stuff! Alrighty! Here we go--come on!
The word is that one of our guests checked out but carelessly left some things behind. Let's see... OK! My notes sayh, honestly! It says we should find <var> <var> somewhere in here! Be careful! These kinds of things are easy to break, so watch your clodhoppers!
What's up? You just remember a hot date or something?
Well, alrighty then! I'll just have to go and find this stuff myself!
Roger that! Be careful when you're searching. If you stomp on a guest's precious item... Ooh, we would be in so-o-o much trouble!
AGHH! You stepped on the <var>! Is that a crack?!
AGHHH!!! You crushed the <var>! Ooh, we're in for it now...
Tsk tsk tsk. There's no fixing that kind of damage.
You found <var>! That's <var> down!
All lost items have been found!
Good job out there, kiddo! We found everything we were supposed to!
Ohhh, I'm on cloud nine over here! That was a totally perfect awesome job!
Don't worry. I'll take responsibility for the damage and apologize to the guests myself. After all, I'm the one who asked you to help! So thanks again for the hard work!
