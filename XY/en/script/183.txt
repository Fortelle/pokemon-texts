This gate is the entrance to Victory Road! Only Pokémon Trainers who've collected all eight Badges may pass!
So, your total number of Badges is... Oh, I'm sorry, but you don't have the qualifications needed to take on Victory Road. Please come back when you have eight Badges.
Your total number of Badges is... One, two, three, four... Wow! You have all eight. Well then, allow me to test your abilities.
Fantastic! Please allow me to say it once more: fantastic! May the road you and your Pokémon follow be filled with joy and success.
Where do you think you're going? Listen up. Taking on challenges may be important. But as for what lies beyond here? You're not ready to tackle that yet.
