<var>, you're here! You got my message on the Holo Caster, in fact? Then I need three minutes only. It is this. We have a case to solve! I count on your help, <var>! Let us put our partnership to the test!
My notes are on the desk. Take 30 seconds to read up on the case.
LOOKER'S NOTEBOOK Case open: ★ Client: A rep from a Lumiose City mothers' group ★ Details: "Kids in Lumiose City seem to be spending a lot of time in back alleys recently." "What are they up to in these shadowy, suspicious places? Inquiring mothers want to know!"
"My son is about to take the entrance exam for an elite school for future Ace Trainers!" "I can't have him do anything stupid and get a black mark on his academic record!" "You must do something to make kids stop hanging out in those suspicious alleys!" ★ Reward: Enough dough to last for a week
All read up and all ready to go? Good! The first thing I want you to do is to visit those dark alleys in Lumiose City. Find where kids are hanging out, and get the lowdown on the situation. Got it? Think you can handle it, partner?
I am counting on you, <var>. There are a number of alleys here in Lumiose City. Somewhere, in one of them, you should find those kids! Yes. Yes, indeed. Hmm... My gut tells me there's something fishy about the alley leading off South Boulevard. When you've got a gut boiled as hard as mine, it's worth paying attention to! Start your investigations on South Boulevard. I'll join you when I can.
Oh, wait! Here's an idea! I need three seconds... To help you on your way, I'll jot down the locations of all the alleys in my notebook!
You've got this, <var>. Fear not. Off to the dark alleyways of Lumiose City!
What? <var>, no, no, no! That is not the answer I want to hear! I want you to investigate the dark alleys of Lumiose City and scope out what's happening with these kids! You've got this, right?
LOOKER'S NOTEBOOK Alleys in Lumiose City ★ South Boulevard    Beside Restaurant Le Nah ★ North Boulevard    Across from the Galette Stand ★ North Boulevard    Across from Lumiose Station ★ North Boulevard    Beside Café Triste
Huh? Who are you? This is our secret base! You're a grown-up! You're not allowed in. Well, if you think you're comin' in, you're gonna hafta beat me in battle!
Ah ha! Look out! I'm weally, weally stwong!
Shoo! Shoo! Go on! Get lost!
Huh, you're pretty strong. Not bad... I guess I'll let you in.
Uh-uh, you! What a worffless little sister I have! You're gonna hafta fight me now! Last chance if you wanna run away! Do you think you can beat me and my Pokémon in battle? Pffft!
Huh-uh, the bigger they are, the harder they fall! You're gonna be sorry you ever saw me. Come on!
Bye-bye, worffless grown-up! Hurry home to your mama!
Uh-huh! This Trainer's got some muscle in hiser hustle!
Hahaha! You there! You're not too shabby! But can ya beat me? Bring it, if ya got the guts!
This is our own private paradise! Take off and leave us in peace!
Just leave us alone! Go home already!
Harrumph. I guess you're sorta strong... Fine, then. I guess I'll let you continue.
Wha-wha-wha-wha... What do I do now?! Y-you, um, you really want to get in here, huh?
Of course ya do... So... I figure I'm gonna hafta fight ya.
Th-that's right! Good! N-now go away already!
Erk... I figured I'd lose anyway... Now it's up to Mimi to save us.
Pardon, pardon. It took a while to find you! How's the investigation going, <var>? Do you have news to report?
Mrrawwwr!
Oho! Did you hear that cry? I feel like it came from deeper inside the alley...
Mrrawwwr!
Why, it's a Pokémon! But to threaten humans like that, it is apparently none too gentle... It may consider this area its territory.
Yup, old man, you got that right.
Eh? Who's there? Show yourself!
Oh, nobody special. But this little sweetie right here is Mimi. That's what I named it, anyway.
Mrrawr! Mrrrawwwrrr!
Ahem. Then this is your Pokémon? In which case, would you mind returning it to its Poké Ball for a bit?
Huh? What Poké Ball?
Pardon?
I'm not a Trainer! Mimi is my friend. I have no money to buy Poké Balls, so I can't be a Trainer, you get it? Anyway, Mimi and I don't need a Poké Ball to be friends!
Of course. I...get it. Please forgive my error. My name is Looker. I work as a detective. May I introduce my partner, <var>.
If you will permit me to ask, Mimi's friend... I am interested in what you're all doing here.
Well, we're all playing, that's all. Everybody here is a friend of mine. What are you asking for? Do you want to join or something?
What! No, no, no-o-o-o-o! Don't do it! This is our secret base. Kids only! No grown-ups allowed!
Mrrawwwr!
Oh, put a sock in it! Play nice, both of you! How would you like to get left out just 'cause you're old and stuff?
... ... ... You seem to have a good group of friends playing together here. But why did you pick a dark alley like this one to play in? Lumiose City is filled with plazas and open spaces and sunny corners. Flowers can't bloom without sunshine, and neither can young folks, you know.
Oh, really? Well... Mimi and I have always lived in alleys, so I don't know much about sunshine.
...Mrawp.
You live in an alley? You and Mimi? And...your family? They--
They're gone. I'm alone.
I see.
Well, but... But Mimi is sort of my family. We stick together.
Indeed...
Indeed! I, Looker, have struck upon an idea! A genius idea. And here it is! Friend of Mimi! I invite you to stay at my office, the Looker Bureau. You may work as my assistant and, in exchange, you may live in the office. I myself live elsewhere in a hotel, so you'll have it all to yourself after hours!
Wha...
It is not to imply that anything's wrong with a free life in the alleys, but... To have a home to shelter you from the cold and the rain... There is joy in having work to do each day and your efforts seen and appreciated. This idea is genius, even for me!
And, Mimi, are you on board, too? It wouldn't be the same without you!
Mrrrawr... Mrrawwwr!
Wh-what? Why did Mimi run off?
Mimi gets scared pretty easy. Afraid of humans, I guess. Especially grown-ups. Hey... Mr. Looker-guy... For a minute there, I was kinda happy that you invited me to stay with you... You're pretty cool. But I can't. Mimi likes it better here. I can't leave Mimi behind. We stick together.
Hold on! Mimi may grow to like me in time. But even if not, we can try a new angle. At a time like this, it helps to have a partner you can count on.
P-partner?
Indeed! <var>! Your assignment is to befriend Mimi. You can do it!
Umm... <var>? If you wanna make friends with Mimi, you're gonna have to track it down first. There's, like, tons of alleys in Lumiose City. Mimi wanders all over them on its strolls. If you find it, try talking to it... Or do something to make Mimi like you.
Can you handle it, <var>? If you succeed in making friends with Mimi, it may accept me as well. I'm your partner, after all! Yes! <var>, I'm counting on you!
Her an' Mimi play with us whenever we want. They're weally, weally nice.
Mimi gets mad when strangers try to touch it, y'know? If you want Mimi to like you, better not try to grab it or anything.
You're gonna look for Mimi? Well, this here is the only alley on South Boulevard. There are three other alleys you can get to from North Boulevard. As long as that old guy hangs around, no way is Mimi coming back here. Betcha it's wandering around those alleys up on North Boulevard.
Mother wants me to be an Ace Trainer. I was a Rising Star, trying to please her. But I couldn't really shine, because my true dream is to become a Swimmer ♂! I just ended up avoiding the pressure by hanging out with my friends here.
Murrr... Mrrrawwwr...
Mimi is looking at you. What are you going to do?
...Mrrrawwwrar.
Hiss! Hissssss!
Mrawr! ♪ Murr-murr-murrr! ♪
Mimi ran off somewhere... It seems you didn't succeed in catching Mimi's attention at all.
With an angry scowl, Mimi ran off somewhere.
Mimi ran off somewhere-- with a hint of a smile...
Murrrmurrr-mrrrawwwr!
Oh! <var>! Well done! Mimi seems to have taken a shine to you!
Awesome! <var>, are you wicked or what? How'd you get Mimi to like you so fast?
Thank you, <var>. You have proven your worth as my partner.
Well, friend of Mimi? Problem solved? All set? Is it time for you to graduate from life on the streets and join the Looker Bureau as my assistant?
OK! I'm ready! As long as Mimi's with me! ♪ I'm pretty curious to find out what a detective does!
Ha ha! A detective is a hard-boiled kind of person! <var>, let us make our way to the Looker Bureau with our new assistant!
Wow... So this is the Looker Bureau? It's sure warmer than the alley. This is gonna be great, huh, Mimi?
Murrr-mrrrawwr?
Please, make yourself comfortable! From today on, you will work here as my assistant! And you may live here as long as you choose!
I seem to have forgotten my manners. Pardon me for not asking your name. What do you prefer to go by, or shall we stick with "Friend-of-Mimi"?
Who, me? I'm just Emma.
Nice to meet you! ♪
Emma, is it? Indeed, a pretty name!
Ahem. The case of the kids in the alleys is now closed. With Emma staying here instead, kids will stop making the alleys their second home! <var>, I will send a message on your Holo Caster the next time we get a case! I look forward to it indeed.
Emma and Mimi... I was absolutely right to invite them to stay here. Truly genius, no doubt. What I don't know is if enough work will appear to keep food on our table. ... ... ... I-I guess I'll roll up my sleeves and concentrate on my mission! Th-this is what it means to be a hard-boiled detective.
Hello, <var>. I don't have any cases at the moment. I'm teaching Emma to read and write and do basic arithmetic. When a new case appears, I'll contact you via Holo Caster! I look forward to it indeed.
Oh, hi, <var>! Did you ever go to school? School is a place where they teach you all kinds of things, so I heard. Guess what? I told Mr. Looker I'd never gone to school, and he said he'd teach me himself!
Mrrrawwwrrr!
LOOKER'S TOP-SECRET JOURNAL ･ The XXth day of the XXth month... Every day is filled with taking care of Emma and Mimi. Seeing their shining faces across the table, I can't help but think... The action-packed life of a hard-boiled detective has turned into a family story... But there is a new source of suspense... in the thinness of my wallet.
