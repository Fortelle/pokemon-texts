Please wait, sirmiss.
I apologize for stopping you suddenly. But the Pokémon you just received is surely the Mythical Pokémon Diancie, isn't it?
Diancie... A sudden mutation of a Carbink. The probability and mechanism of its origin are still veiled in mystery.
The Pokémon Diancie is synonymous with beauty. Its body absorbs light with a perfect balance and gives off a radiance that looks like nothing in this world.
In order to see that beauty, our master has been looking for Diancie for a long time. We are also very keen on taking Diancie to our master... That desire kept us going and led us here.

Let me get straight to the point. Would you kindly give us your Diancie?
No way!
All right...
Is there some way we can persuade you?
Hmmm... Is there any way...
Oh! I'm so glad you're so understanding. Then...
Wait.
M-master?!
I'm sorry for troubling you.
You... I truly appreciate your efforts in seeking Diancie for me. But...
What you can truly value is not something you can get by depriving somebody of a relationship. You should get it by your own actions, by your own efforts, or sometimes simply by your own luck. Then it will have true value.
To be honest with you, I envy you. But more importantly, I'd like to congratulate you on meeting Diancie and becoming travel partners. Congratulations.
Legend has it that Diancie protects its travel partners from accidents and illnesses. I wish you good luck and hope you can keep traveling together.
You two... Sorry, I shouldn't keep relying on you, but please help me find my Diancie.
My pleasure, sir.
