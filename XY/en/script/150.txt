What an amazing turnout! All of these people are here to celebrate your achievements.
I'd like to present you with the Honor of Kalos for the bravery you showed battling Team Flare!
I'm so proud of you all!
On behalf of the entire Kalos region, I'd like to say...
Thank you!
Battle with me.
I want to know what a "Trainer" is.
Thank you very much for battling with me. Now I finally feel free...
Free from the part of me mired in sorrow--the part of me that built the ultimate weapon...
Floette...
It's been 3,000 years...
His Pokémon was waiting all this time...
Waiting for him to return to the man he was. The man who loved Pokémon with all his heart.
