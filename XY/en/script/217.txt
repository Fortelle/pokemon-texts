The entrance fee will be $1,000 per person.
You've got to be kidding! It costs money to go inside?
You see, the owner of the palace follows the school of thought that you can never have too much money.
Yeesh! This is how the rich get richer! Here's your entrance fee: $1,000!
The proceeds from the entrance fee help pay for repairing and restoring the palace. Probably...
Why, I never! You don't even have $1,000? Well, I suppose I can still let you in... Just act natural and don't arouse suspicion. Pass through the gate like you belong here.
Please enter. It's been decided that we will no longer charge an entrance fee.
I wonder how much money it takes to build a palace like that.
I'd like to live in that kind of palace!
Tch! Are old buildings more important than people who are alive now?
Hey, Trainer! Yes, you there, young manlady! I'll share an Oran Berry with you.
If you feed an Oran Berry to your Pokémon, it will recover some strength! And if you let your Pokémon hold an Oran Berry, it can eat the Berry during battle!
