As long as you're alive, you'll always be in someone else's way, you know? But it's true for all of us, so try not to get too bothered if it happens to you.
Our cook likes to make everything like he was trained at a sushi restaurant. He's definitely not a normal Chef...
Food has to be fresh! Just leave it up to me!
I'm cleaning a square room 'round in circles! In other words... I'm cuttin' the corners!
Oh, won't someone, somewhere... give me a Lovely Kiss someday...
Ahhhhhhhhh! It's not broken! It's not!
We Waitresses have put together a band!
I use Belly Drum and Beat Up to inspire my drumwork.
We're gonna use a Trainer PR Video to get the word out about our band!
Our signature move is double-team cleaning!
I just can't seem to get this stain out! We both have to take it on at once!
Mm-hmm! Look at the sheen on this vase! It's a pretty fine job, if I do say so myself.

Fouaf fouaf!
Ouaf-ouaf-fouaf!
Lovely how they don't lock the doors here at the Hotel Richissime, isn't it? This hotel feels so freeing somehow.
... ... ... ...Don't talk to me... ...If you do, I won't... ...hear the elevator...
Oh, my darling, where have you gone? Leaving dear Marill and me all alone...
Rrrrrrill...
Gulp!
I-I-I wasn't trying to drink out of the vase or anything! You saw nothing!
