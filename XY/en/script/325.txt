Hey, leave me alone... We're in the middle of a shoot...
This third-rate model! Doesn't she know what "natural" means? It's detracting from Mamoswine's charms!
Oh, I'm sorry, but we're in the middle of a shoot.
Just getting one of Lumiose's buildings makes for a great image. It's really convenient for commercial shoots.
My darling Mamoswine is a hot ticket in shows and the media right now! You could say it's one of the super Pokémodels.
Swy-y-y. Swyy-y-y-y swy-y.
I heard it's still photography for the cosmetics brand, Mamoswinelline.
Squeal! It's THE Mamoswine! I can't believe I get to see it doing mass-media work in person! That's a big city like Lumiose for you!
Hey! What do you think you're doing? We're in the middle of a shoot! You can't just do anything you want because you're famous in Lumiose!
Looking great! That smile is just the best!
Oh... It seems like you're quite well known around these parts. Now that she's famous, that model is pretty brash. Mamoswine is nice that way-- it hasn't changed a bit.
The Pokémon called Mamoswine haven't changed in 10,000 years. And the concept behind Mamoswinelline is "Never change, and always be beautiful!"
I used to be a fan of that model, but her personality has really changed...
