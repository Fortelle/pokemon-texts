Welcome to Café Kizuna.
Er... Well... Imagining what Pokémon are thinking, even abstractly...is fine.
People in Kalos take a lot of vacations. We worked hard and built a society where we can take vacations.
Pokémon released from Poké Balls live their own lives. But for Pokémon that spend their whole lives with Trainers... Can they do that, too?
If my Furfrou feels happy being with me, I won't ask anything more!
I've come up with an idea to be more friendly with Pokémon! We go inside Poké Balls, too! See! Isn't that great?
Nma!
Myaoww?
Tee hee!
Whoosh!
