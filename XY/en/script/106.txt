... ... ... No, I simply can't say.
You there! Young manlady! I have a question I must pose to you. Do you think Pokémon battling can ever be worthy of being called an art?
... ... ... Indeed. You see, cooking is the type of art that disappears as soon as it is completed. Pokémon battles are the same. Even memories of sweet victory soon fade after the battle ends. To devote yourself entirely to such a life, made up of fleeting experiences--that is truly artful.
Fool! You silly, unseeing child! If all you seek in life is to fill your stomach with some tasteless matter, then why are there Chefs in this world?! We labor tirelessly to make something wonderful that will disappear from sight as soon as it is enjoyed. That is the life of a Chef! That is the life of a Trainer!
Devote yourself entirely, so even that which will fade and disappear is ingrained forever upon your heart and mind! That is the only fate for any human.
There are no weak Pokémon in a Pokémon battle. There are only weak Trainers. Find the good in every one of your Pokémon. Draw out the unique strengths they possess. Now step back into that elevator and return to the room from which you came.
It is the duty of both Trainers and Chefs to find the good in any raw materials they have to work with. There lies the answer to reaching ever higher. Battle the last two of us and find it for yourself.
There is only one course remaining in your Pokémon League banquet. Devour it with the hunger for strength. Savor it without leaving a scrap behind.
You have drawn forth the strength of Pokémon with your own particular style and method. And now you can challenge the Champion.
