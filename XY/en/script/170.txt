Your dear Pokémon are so full of energy!
How about if I help your dear Pokémon rest up a bit?
You can go up ahead here if you use the move Strength.
Hm? If you want to get to Ambrette Town, you'll be best off heading back to Route 7. Then take the other entrance to the cave.
Ah yes, the HM Strength is the perfect harmony between Pokémon and Trainer!
I can't get out of here! And it's all your fault! Sorry. I had some frustration to vent. Here--have this as my apology.
Frustration is a move that gets stronger the less your Pokémon like you. Frustrating, huh?
