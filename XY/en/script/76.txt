I'm stylishly looking for something so I can join the mission at the Power Plant. If you want me to lend a stylish ear, come back when you have four Badges!
I'm a member of the stylish Team Flare, and I'm gonna win in style!
And now, I'll stylishly run away!
Huh?
Where's my Power Plant Pass?!
Oh no! D-did I drop my Power Plant Pass somewhere? I know what to do! I'll make a stylish deduction! I must've dropped it when I was feeling around that boulder nine steps east of where I'm standing. If I only had a Dowsing Machine, then I could find it with style!
H-how in the world do you have a Power Plant Pass? Aha! I'll make a stylish deduction! You picked up the Power Plant Pass I dropped when I was checking out that big boulder! And, what's worse, you plan on going to the Power Plant, don't you?!
This is stylishly bad! If someone found the Power Plant Pass I dropped while I was fumbling around by the big rock... and then that hypothetical someone proceeded to the Power Plant just past here... That would be seriously, stylishly a hot mess!
Those Team Flare people in those red suits... Nobody who's worth anything hangs out with a group wearing garish outfits like that.
Pokémon around here will pop out at you. Maybe the electricity from the Power Plant has something to do with it...

The door to the Kalos Power Plant opened.
Is the power not getting here? The gate to Lumiose won't open... The Power Plant is running, so what could be going on?
Were the folks at the Kalos Power Plant on vacation or something?
