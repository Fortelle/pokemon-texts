Quiz time!
Who's that Pokémon?! 1. Pansage     2. Pansear 3. Panpour
Go talk to the Trainer who's the same number as the right answer!
Buzz! Too bad, so sad! That was obviously the wrong answer! I guess you'll have to fight another Trainer.
Ding-ding-ding! You're correct! Well, aren't you a clever one!
Please stand in the answering area!
Then step into the elevator!
If you want to hear the question again, step on the small panel!
Could it be that you did not choose Pansage as an answer so much as you chose me to battle with?
Do you think you'll make it onto the next elevator?
Take your time.
Don't let Clemont down!
Are you sure it's Pansear, in your heart of hearts?
A Pokémon battle! That is indeed the path to truth and answers!
It's good to think things through, but mindlessly battling is good, too.
Forge your path with Pokémon! You are a Trainer, after all!
I don't know, kid... You sure about Panpour?
You're ready to take responsibility for your own choices, are you?
I can't argue with that. It's up to you to decide how you spend the time you have.
When a Trainer decides something, she also decides hiser Pokémon's fate.
Which floor would you like to go to?
