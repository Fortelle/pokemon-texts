A terribly long time ago...
There was a man and a Pokémon. He loved that Pokémon very much.
A war began.
The man's beloved Pokémon took part in the war.
Several years passed.
He was given a tiny box.
The man wanted to bring the Pokémon back. No matter what it took.
The man built a machine to give it life.
He brought his beloved Pokémon back.
The man had suffered too much. His rage still had not subsided.
He could not forgive the world that had hurt the Pokémon he loved.
He turned the machine into the ultimate weapon.
The man became a bringer of destruction that ended the war.
The Pokémon that was given life must have known...
That the lives of many Pokémon were taken to restore its life.
The resurrected Pokémon left the man.
