The development of the Poké Ball really brought Pokémon and humans closer together!
My personal recommendation is the Quick Ball!
If you run into a Pokémon you really want, try throwing a Quick Ball right away!
My personal recommendation is the Timer Ball!
The Timer Ball works really well for catching powerful Pokémon that can heal themselves.
Your <var> is so very charming!
Oh, Espurr! Please stop pulling pranks with your psychic power!
Meo ho ho!
If you catch a Pokémon, your Pokémon will gain experience, too! It's a win-win for real!
