Oh... I wasn't expecting a visitor in a place like this. Hmm... You seem to be a pretty good Trainer.
Shall we have a rather strange Pok√©mon battle? I call this an Inverse Battle! With my mysterious power, I will reverse type matchups for a while... Supereffective moves will not be very effective. Moves that are not very effective will be super effective. What do you think? Does it sound fun? You may understand it in theory, but when you try it, you'll find that it's more difficult than you thought. Would you care to try an Inverse Battle?
The reason why you came here is... to try an Inverse Battle, right?
Supereffective moves will not be very effective... And moves that are not very effective will be super effective.
Oh, I see... That's too bad. If you change your mind, come again.
Great! You're an expert at Inverse Battles. I'm no match for you. You're really great, so I'll give you this.
