Thanks for visiting our aquarium! Your interest marines so much to us!
The Pokémon on the far side of the glass... All they see every day is the strange faces of the humans who have come to see them.
Do you think there are still Pokémon that've never been seen down there? Deep, deep in the depths of the sea...
Wowzers! I just saw a fish Pokémon hiding behind that rock!
Aw, I wanna swim in the sea with the Pokémon!
A wandering young Trainer, are you? Let me guess--you wish to fish for all the Pokémon in the sea, right? I'm sure you do! Shall I lend you a rod? I'm a fishing fanatic, and I've collected more Old Rods than I could ever use!
You really do want to fish for all of the Pokémon in the sea, huh? Then how about I give you a rod? After all, I have more Old Rods than I know what to do with!
Yeah!
Not now.
There you are: one fishing rod! I'll teach you quickly how to use it. First, you've got to face the water when you use it. If an exclamation mark appears, press the A Button! You can either try to catch the Pokémon that you fish or just beat 'em in battle! It's up to you now!
Ah hm! What a modest ladss you are, hm? Look at that lovely, spacious Bag of yours! I'm sure you have space for an Old Rod!
Mrrraowr!
The amazing Pokémon Ability Storm Drain! Not only does it draw all Water-type moves to a Pokémon--it even raises their Sp. Atk!
There are many types of Pokémon in the wider world. Solely Water types are most populous... After Normal types, of course!
Route 8 continues on out that door there. That's right! Route 8 sure is a long one! It runs down the cliffs, through Ambrette Town, along the sea, and all the way to the next town!
