Greetings, sirmiss. This is the gate to Route 18.
Stop! The road up ahead was all torn up by the Durant, and we're still trying to fix it.
The road up ahead was all riddled with tunnels from a horde of Durant. Took forever to fix! But I guess they were just doing what they love...
I guess the Durant were just giving it their all in their own way. I s'ppose from a Pok√©mon's point of view, human roads and things don't mean much.
It's good to live the life you want... But not if it's troubling other folk! That's what we call selfish, that is.
