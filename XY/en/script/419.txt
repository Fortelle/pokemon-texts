That determined expression... That glint in your eye that says you're up to the challenge... It's fantastic! Just fantastic! Is this your first time challenging a Gym? Fantastic! Whether it's the tears of frustration that follow a loss or the blossoming of joy that comes with victory... They're both great subjects for my camera! Fantastic! This'll be just fantastic! Now come at me! My lens is always focused on victory-- I won't let anything ruin this shot!
Young Trainer, you... No, it wasn't you alone. You and your <var> have shown me a whole new depth of field! Fantastic! Just fantastic!
<var> received the Bug Badge from Viola!
With that Bug Badge, Pokémon up to Lv. 30 will listen to your orders in battle... Yup, even if you get them from trades! And here! This TM commemorates your win against a pro photog like me.
Using a TM like that one there lets you teach your Pokémon some new moves quicker than a shutter set to 1/1000 can snap shut! TMs are some of the best gear around. They're point-and-click easy, and you can use them over and over again! Now, the TM that I just gave you is for a move called Infestation. Use it, and it'll be impossible for your opponent to flee from battle!
Now then, can you zoom in a bit to check out the tent behind me? Take the stairs that you find beyond it, and you'll be back up to the entrance faster than a flash!
There are some things that you can only see when looking through a camera's viewfinder. And there are things you'll only be able to see clearly by living together with Pokémon. And if, along the way, you find that the things most important to you come into focus... Well, that'd be fantastic! Just fantastic!
The world you see through a lens, and the world you see with a Pokémon by your side... The same world can look entirely different depending on your view.
