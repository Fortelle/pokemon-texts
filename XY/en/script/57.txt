Welcome to Vaniville Town! My name's Serena. I'm your neighbor.
Welcome to Vaniville Town! The name's Calem. I live next door.
And I'm Shauna! Great to meet you! Guess what! We've come to get you!
The esteemed Professor Sycamore lives here in the Kalos region. I was told he has a request for five kids, including us. But I'm a little surprised he knows who you are. You did just move to Vaniville, after all.

We'll wait for you in the next town over! And you know what?! We're going to get...a Pokémon! C'mon! Hurry! Let's go!
Grr... Groo...
Roaaaah!
What was that just now?
Ha ha ha! What a card! I guess Rhyhorn just wanted to give you a big send-off for your journey! Well, it has known you since you were born, after all!
Good luck, <var>! Go for broke! And don't worry! You'll have Pokémon by your side, so you'll be fine!
All right, <var>! Have fun on your journey with <var>! Tell me all about the things you experience in your travels!
Vaniville Town is pretty nice, right? The Kalos region has lots of cool towns! I want to see them all when I get big!











I reeeally want a Pokémon! Then I could go wherever I want!
Is that <var>? I wish I had a Pokémon.
Science is amazing! If you use communication technology, you can look all over the world for players who are playing at the same time you are. Then you can play together!
<var>! That parade was so great!
Ummm... I have something I want to ask you. Do you mind?
I want to trade Pokémon with you, <var>!
They'll be like friendship bracelets, but Pokémon! ♪ I'll give you this <var>! I found it in an Egg! ♪ You can give me any Pokémon you want!
Yay!
Your Pokémon is really special to me, <var>! ♪ Of course, each and every Pokémon is special, too!
Wha--? I wanted <var>.
Oh, OK... Maybe next time, then!
What? You only have one Pokémon? We can't trade if you only have one, so let's trade some other time!
When I see a Pokémon I traded for, it always makes me think of the person who traded it to me!
I'm really amazed when I think about the five of us that were chosen in Kalos! I mean, if I hadn't been chosen, I wouldn't have met you, <var>! ♪
Know what? I'm going to go to a faraway region next time! I'll make lots of great memories while I'm there! ♪
I can't imagine riding a Rhyhorn and racing! Your mom sure is amazing, <var>! ♪
