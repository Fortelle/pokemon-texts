I'm really a superstar, but this look of mine... It needs some pizzazz! I'm no shrinking violet! Maybe if I tried Petal Blizzard or something...
Oh! Your <var>! It knows Petal Blizzard! Oh, pretty, pretty please! Won't you use it for me?
<var> used Petal Blizzard!
Yes! That's it! Petal Blizzard! Take this as a thank-you gift, OK?
Using Petal Blizzard will do damage to everything around! With this move, I think I can really bloom as a superstar!
