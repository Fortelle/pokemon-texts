I met some eccentric ladies' man in a café the other day. Turned out he was a professor! He told me a story about how, long ago, there was a Pokémon that was much beloved by its king and how that Pokémon ended up saving the king's life. According to the professor, the stories that remain from that time indicate that it was a Fairy type.
It's interesting to see how a single discovery can change the world. With the recent classification of the Fairy type, Pokémon type matchups have changed forever!
I heard there's a person in Anistar City who can read the memories of Pokémon!
