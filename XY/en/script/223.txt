Are you a traveling Trainer? I'll show you something great. Trust me, you'll be excited!
Every time I see this <var>, my heart starts pounding.
I met this Pokémon in the Kalos region! It's the <var> of my destiny!
The partner of my destiny... Yes. I feel I'm gonna meet that person in Kalos, too.
The fun part of a trip is an encounter. The person who said such a great line is, of course, me.
See! It's a very cute <var>, right? It's so charming. But my girlfriend is even more charming!
I spend time with this <var> on the terrace, watching people pass by.
When I laugh, my <var> also laughs. When I get sad, my <var> also gets sad. That's right... How you spend time with your Pokémon is up to you.
When I'm with my <var>, even being stood up is fun!
My girlfriend hasn't come back from a boutique... I've already had 10 glasses of their special juice!
What is a good point of this <var>?
We're talking about 10 good points of each other's Pokémon. I can also tell you 10 good points of my boyfriend, but he...
Hi. Can you tell a good point of the <var> I'm going to show you?
We're talking about 10 good points of each other's Pokémon.
What is <var>...?
A Pokémon is a mirror to reflect a person.
Don't you think this <var> looks strong?
A Pokémon that offers a gap between perception and reality is fascinating.
I'm wondering if you know this <var>.
At a glance, you can tell this Pokémon is brilliant! Just looking at it, I feel so happy!
I'm telling you! Look at my partner Pokémon!
Sigh... My heart sighs because I met such a wonderful, wonderful <var>.
Excuse me. Would you kindly look at my Pokémon?
What do you think? My dear <var> looks exactly like me! We both display elegance... We both pour out grace...
