This floor here is used by folks who couldn't get into any café.
The most popular seats in any café are the terrace seats where you're awash in sunlight. But if I'm stuck sitting inside, all I have to do is have my Ludicolo use Sunny Day for me.
C'est la vie! At least I have Pokémon here beside me... That's life, n'est-ce pas?
I love to see the dashing pompiers at work! I suppose you would call them "firefighters." Always first on the scene, and then when their Pokémon use Water Gun... Ooh-la-la!
Apparently people describe muggy weather as "heavy" here in the Kalos region! How clever!
Welcome. This is the office café. Are all the people here working, or are they slacking off? Who knows? Please enjoy the puzzling air!
Ouaf...
Fouaf fouaf!
