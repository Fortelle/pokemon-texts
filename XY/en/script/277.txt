Ho! So yeh've made it clear up here! I'm the Gym Leader. Ramos's the name. So what'd yeh think, whippersnapper? Did yeh enjoy the garden playground I made with all these sturdy plants o' mine? Their strength is a sign o' my strength as a gardener and a Gym Leader! Yeh sure yer up to facing all that?
Yeh believe in yer Pokémon... And they believe in yeh, too... Mighty oaks from acorns grow. Go on, then. Yeh've earned it. Here's yer own Plant Badge, sprout.
<var> received the Plant Badge from Ramos!
If yeh've got yerself a Plant Badge, then yeh can use the HM Fly even when not battling. It's a real boon. Pokémon up to Lv. 60 will listen to yeh, too, easy as falling off a log. Even if yeh got 'em from a trade. Here--have this, too. Might as well make hay while the sun shines, I reckon.
That TM there is for Grass Knot. Yeh can use it to trip yer opponent up in the grass. The heavier the opponent, the harder it'll fall-- and the more it'll hurt.
Ain't it a marvel? Frail little blades o' grass can break through concrete, even. I can't help admirin' that strength.
When yeh know for certain sure yeh ain't never gonna meet again... Well, yeh can give in and accept it. But if yeh think there might be a chance, and yeh wander the world for 3,000 years tortured by that flicker of hope... I tell yeh, sprout. I couldn't have stood it.
How's the bout, little sprout?
You got it figured out yet, Champ? Yup! Old man Ramos's Gym is all about Grass! It's simple, right? You see a vine hanging in front of you, and you just grab right on! And hang on for dear life! That's maybe the most important part of all, right, pal?
So you cut our Leader down to size, did ya? Then I'll give it up to ya! Look! There's your name, engraved forever in those mysterious statues!
