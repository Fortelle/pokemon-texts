<var>! Serena!
<var>! Calem!
I don't believe it... What are you doing here?
Shauna?! What are you doing here?
I'm sorry... I know... I'm just going to slow you down.
...
...
But...
But friends should stick together!
I'm the one who should be apologizing. You came all the way out here, and I wasn't very considerate of your feelings... You are right. Friends should stick together.
<var>, we should all go together, right?
Of course!
But...
I knew you'd agree! OK! Shauna, <var> and I will go ahead. Stay close to us, OK?
I know you're concerned because it's dangerous. But it would be more dangerous for her to go back alone... Shauna, let's go together!
I'm sorry... I wasn't thinking clearly, and I didn't consider your feelings. Thank you for coming. Friends should stick together.
<var>, we'll all stick together, right?
Naturally!
But...
It's settled then! Shauna, <var> and I will go ahead. Stay close, OK?
I know how you feel. Danger does wait up ahead. But she'll be much safer if she stays with us, right? Shauna, <var> and I will go ahead. Stay close, OK?
OK! Thank you! ♪
It's an electronic lock. What should we do?
An electronic lock... Now what?
This might help! It's a device that helps you when you're stuck on a puzzle. Clemont gave it to me!
An electronic lock and a puzzle are the same sort of thing, right? ♪
Ta daa! The lock opened! ♪ Oh! And the device actually broke...
Amazing, Shauna! You and Clemont's device are both full of surprises...
So... We're finally here. The Legendary Pokémon is inside. Let's go help it!
Not bad, Shauna! Well, Clemont was the one who made it. But you brought it here! So, I guess both of you are pretty great!
We're finally here. The Legendary Pokémon is inside. Let's save it together!
Are you going back?
Don't...keep us waiting long, OK?
Let's hurry.
Let's go. Shauna, you come, too.
I get what Lysandre is trying to say, but his methods are insane!
The ultimate weapon... What will happen if it's used?
Anyway, we have to hurry and stop it!
Are you going back?
Got it.
Let's hurry!
Let's go. Shauna, come along.
I get what Lysandre is trying to say, but what he wants to do is so wrong!
The ultimate weapon... It's crazy! People shouldn't make things like that!
We have to stop the ultimate weapon.
I'm afraid we're going to have to ask you to turn back. The Legendary Pokémon IS at the end of this chamber, after all.
Searching deep in Kalos's mountains for the Legendary Pokémon was backbreaking work. All of that dirt completely wrecked my nice white suit.
Why did you tell them that?! Who would even do something like that?!
That's right. The Legendary Pokémon is deep within our secret headquarters. But its energy is being absorbed into the ultimate weapon.
Even if things are just as we heard, I can't believe they're sending smart guys like us to run off some little "Rattata" that wandered in.
The five million I paid to join Team Flare won't go to waste, right?
We won't lose! You won't get one step farther! The Trainers moving on to the next level will be Team Flare!
I just can't keep listening to selfish fools anymore! The only thing that matters is that the members of Team Flare are happy!
Our plans haven't succeeded just yet! We cannot afford any careless mistakes!
We worried about an uncertain future, but Lysandre showed us how to get to his certain future.
Who's got that flair? Team Flare! Yeah, we've got that flair! Team Flare!
Who's got that flair? Team Flare! Yeah, we've got that flair! Team Flare!
The Kalos region... I'm sure it's gonna be OK! You two are amazing, after all! I know you can stop them!
