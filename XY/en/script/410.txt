Right through this gate is Route 5, also known as Versant Road. It leads to both Parfum Palace and Camphrier Town.
Sometimes it's nice to take the long way! You never know what you'll find.
If you lose your way in Lumiose City, I recommend entering a nearby shop to get your bearings.
Hey!
Nice to meet you, friend! They call me Mr. Bonding. Have you heard about O-Powers?
That expression of yours tells me you haven't! Don't worry--I'll tell you all about it. O-Powers are mysterious forces that have all kinds of useful effects. They can make your Pok√©mon stronger or even help you get more money! Any friends you have nearby will also benefit from them. They truly are mysterious powers!
Let's get started, shall we? It's bonding time!
You received an O-Power from Mr. Bonding.
You can now use Attack Power and Defense Power!
Attack Power increases the Attack stat.
And Defense Power increases the Defense stat!
That's not all--the powers can gain levels the more you use them!
Take a look at the instructions if you want to know more. Remember--you can activate an O-Power using the PSS. Well then, I do believe I shall take my leave right about now. Hope to see you around!
