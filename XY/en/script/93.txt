For generations, my family's duty has been to teach moves to Pokémon that people call Mythical.
What's this? Your Pokémon already knows this move.
I can teach a move to Keldeo or Meloetta.
Shall I teach a move to one of the Pokémon with you?
Please come back if you want me to teach your Pokémon a move.
I'm so very sorry. It's impossible for me to teach a move to an Egg.
That Pokémon cannot learn the moves I can teach.
That Pokémon already knows the move I can teach.
That Pokémon doesn't have the energy to battle right now.
<var> learned <var>!
What? <var> is...
<var> has resolved to battle and has changed into Resolute Form!
