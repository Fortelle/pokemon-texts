Here we are! I'm so glad to welcome you in. This grand chamber is where you enter the Kalos region's Hall of Fame. This is where Pokémon Trainers will live on forever, remembered always for giving their all in battle to the Pokémon League and for the glory and light that they shared with all.
We will record your experience and the glory that you've shown in facing the Pokémon League here in this grand hall! This will be your--and your Pokémon's--legacy!
Come, <var>...
Come, <var>...
Your love for your Pokémon... And the way that those Pokémon gave everything they had in battle for you... We'll record them all right here for eternity.
