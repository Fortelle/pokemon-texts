Finally, <var>! What took you so long? Guess what! Mr. Looker is getting out of the hospital! Finally! I wanted us all to be here to welcome him home!
Murrr-murrrrrr...
Oh! Mimi, you're back! Come on, Mimi! You're part of the welcome party, too!
Mrawr! Murrr-rrrawr!
Huh? What's wrong with Mimi? I think it's holding something...
Mrrrawr!
It's...a letter? It's from Mr. Looker. <var>... I'll read it out loud, OK?
"To my dearest friends... I must have but a moment of your time. It is I, the great detective Looker. I write today because there is something I must confess to you. This is confidential! Top secret! I am not a private detective at all but an officer of the International Police! You are shocked, of course. My hard-boiled detective act was brilliantly flawless, after all. But I know you have been worrying about my long 'hospital stay' and the strange 'illness' that kept me there. The truth is--I am the very picture of health! My hospital stay was a ruse to keep you all out of harm's way. My intentions were only the best, but it was still a lie, for which I humbly apologize."
"However, my friends, there is another reason for this letter. And so I must request of you just a minute or two more. I came to this region for an investigation. Detective Officer Looker was on the case! And, indeed... Thanks to yours truly, the case is now closed. My greatness prevailed! I cheer! And yet... It also means my time in Kalos is done. I must say good-bye to this lovely region. And, more painfully, to you, my friends. Thank you for all your assistance... And adieu. P.S. To <var>, my colleague... You have been the perfect partner. For all that you have done for me in our time together, I would like to present you with my cherished code name, 'Looker.' And for Emma and Mimi... To the two of you, I leave the Looker Bureau. I purchased the whole building, so never again will you have to worry about rent. It is now yours to do with as you will."
Wh-what is this... Is he joking? What's this "International Police"? H-he wouldn't go and leave us, would he? Why...? Could he leave without even saying a word to us?! It can't be... He can't go... I don't want him to go off somewhere without us! He can't have gotten far yet, right? <var>! I'm going after him!
Mrrraaawwwrrr!!!
Wotcher! How's it going, <var>? I was bored, so I came over!
Eh, when I was comin' in just now, Emma were tearin' out in a hurry! Somethink happenin'?
Now you're gonna up and leave, too?! I came all the way over here to visit! Why you all gotta be so cold like that? An' even old man Looker! When I just ran into him, he said he had to go to the Lumiose Museum and totally blew me off without another word!
Gah, I'm bored outta me skull. Happen I shoulda gone to the museum with our Looker, after all...
LOOKER'S NOTEBOOK To <var>, my friend-- I imagine that you must have read the letter I entrusted to Mimi by now. Here, in my private notes, I must express to you my gratitude and my regrets. My greatest regret is that I had to lie to you, my worthy partner. In adherence to the guidelines of the International Police, I was strictly forbidden to reveal my identity. But I am grateful from the bottom of my heart that you were my partner. Our time together was brief, but I will treasure the memories of working with you for always.
As I wrote in the letter, my task here is complete. I must escort the suspected criminal Xerosic to his trial and bid farewell to this land. I'm sure Emma must be distraught, but I know you of all people will understand why I must go. You are my partner, after all. Thank you for working at my side.                                          Ever your partner,                                                  Looker
Oh! You're that curious young manlady who came the last time... Well, the repairs to that mural have been completed now. And the police officer who just left told me that the suspect has been apprehended.
Oh! You're that same kid who came before to see the mural! The criminal responsible was caught--did you know? I overheard the director of the museum talking with the police! But still...it sure was odd... Why do you think that police officer looked so sad when he walked out of here?
I'm telling you I gave them back! Every last one of them!
...Fine. If you really say that you returned all the Poké Balls that Essentia stole...
And I did! I returned them! And I'm turning myself in without a fight, so just give me a minute!
There is no minute to give you! Our train is about to depart!
Haha! Here they come!
What? <var>! Wh-why are you here?!
Because I contacted Emma, of course! I'm sure she'll be here any minute, too!
Where is he? Hold on! Wait for me, Mr. Looker!
Good timing, Emma!
Oh, Dr. Xerosic! Thanks for your message!
Mr. Looker, I've been searching everywhere for you! Please t-tell me why, please... Why did you lie to us? Why are you leaving us behind?
I...I'm sorry, Emma... But my letter explains everything. I work for the International Police! I am a globe-trotting, crime-fighting elite! Wherever there is a case, I must go! Justice awaits!
Then take me and Mimi with you. We'll join whatever police! We can be police or anything-- if only we can just stay together!
Emma, I wish it could be like that. You can't come. It's not possible at all.
Why not?! Why can't we?! I'm part of the Looker Bureau, too! I'm your assistant, aren't I?!
In fact, the time has come for you to graduate from being my assistant. As of this moment, I name you the new head of the Looker Bureau!
Wh-what?
Listen to me, Emma. You were born and raised in this fair city. Every day of your life, you have been here. You are the only one who knows this city inside and out. No one else could do the things you can do for it! I pass my torch of brilliant detective-ing to you! Take my place, and keep protecting the peace of Lumiose City!
But that's not fair at all!
Come on, <var>! Say something! Tell him he's wrong!
Emma, please. I must ask you to respect the necessity of my decision. <var> understands perfectly why I must go. It is the way of partners. HShe is my partner. We understand each other.
Mrrrawrrr...
Oh, Mimi... Please don't make a sad face on my account. No matter where I go, our bonds will never change. You will be my dear friends from the Looker Bureau, always and forever.
Yes! That is it! Bonds! The preposterous notion which cannot be seen nor measured! And yet I cannot deny that they do still exist! Fear not, Emma, for I suspect that you will always be tied to the International Police by your bonds!
Dr. Xerosic...
Emma! I give you my Expansion Suit! I have removed the remote-control functionality, so you needn't worry! As the new head detective in town, please use your powers as Essentia to protect your beloved Lumiose City! And...and... Please take all of the Pokémon that I raised for so long! They are yours now!
Dr. Xerosic... Dr. Xerosic, you've tried to do terrible things to the world, I guess. I find it hard to see you as that kind of person. I only became a Pokémon Trainer thanks to your being there for me. ... ... ... I will always cherish your Pokémon and your suit, Dr. Xerosic. I won't forget our bonds, either...
Everyone... I'm sorry, but... We are nearly out of time. Our train is due to depart.
Mr. Looker... I think I understand... And I know what I'm gonna do. I'll keep on working hard for you. I've got Mimi and <var> to help me. With Dr. Xerosic's Pokémon and Expansion Suit, I will become the new head of the Looker Bureau!
I leave it in your hands, Emma! I'll rest easy, knowing you're on the case!
Emma! Don't you mess this up, my girl!
Ahem... <var>! Emma! Mimi! I entrust to you three the great task of protecting the peace of Lumiose City!
Thank you for everything! Farewell, my friends!
Thank you... And good-bye...
That's enough...
Muuurrrawr...
Hey, Mimi? You know, we've made a lot of really good friends since we left the alleys... Mr.iss <var> and Mr. Looker... And Dr. Xerosic, too...
Mrawr! Mrawwwr!
Mimi... Those two old guys really did everything for us... Do you think that's what it's like...to have a father?
Mrawr?
Hehehe... Nothing. Never mind. Of course you wouldn't know any better than me, Mimi. But...I'm still glad. I'm glad we got to meet them.
Mrrrrrrawr! ♪
You got a message on your Holo Caster!
Oh! <var>! How're you doing? We've got no new cases in the Looker Bureau today! I was thinking of going for a walk with Mimi, but what if a client came while I was gone? Do you think you could hold down the fort for a while?
Hehehe... Thank you, <var>. You're always so sweet. But never mind--I think I'll stay in. I can take a walk later. Mr. Looker entrusted me with the Looker Bureau, and I've got to be a good head!
Oh, really? O-of course... I see... You're a really busy person, of course. Right, <var>? Sorry for asking too much. Just forget about it, OK? But don't forget that you are also part of the Looker Bureau! So feel free to drop by for a visit any time!
