Try striking up conversations with the Roller Skaters in Lumiose City. Some of them may teach you their favorite tricks!
There are many different tricks! Some examples are the parallel swizzle, where you sway your hips to proceed, and the backflip!
Landing several tricks in a row is called a combo. Word on the street is you might hear a whooshing sound when you pull off a combo successfully...
Come talk to me if you think of anything you want to know more about!

How could this be? Your trick technique is...
Off the charts! Now...you...are a trick master! You're at a level where it's not overstating it to say you're the concept of tricks personified!




I'll teach you a technique that's perfect for a master trickster like you!
You learned a Roller Skate trick: the 360!
It's called a 360 because you turn a full circle! Use small ledges, and you can do a midair pirouette!
All you have to do is jump over a ledge while rotating the Circle Pad in either direction! I'm sure a skater like you can do it!
Grrroundrrrut.
My dream is to be a beautiful genius like Korrina. I'll become pretty and cute, and everyone'll fuss over me!
So, there's this rumor... People are saying a legendary Roller Skater known as "the Dancing Whirlwind" hangs out in the Lost Hotel on Route 15...
