There are so many Pokémon moves, aren't there? I think they're so cool! Pokémon sometimes learn new moves as they level up, you know? I just have to let my Pokémon battle every time it learns a new one and see what it does!
When you have six Pokémon with you and you catch another, that Pokémon will automatically be sent to one of your PC Boxes! The power of science is amazing!
I heard that having your Exp. Share turned ON will give Pokémon in your team half of the Exp. Points received by those who won the battle--even if they don't ever appear in battle themselves!
