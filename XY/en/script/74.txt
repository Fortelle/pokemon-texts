Let's get started, then...
It was a dark and stormy night many years ago. Lost, I arrived at this house and went inside. The lights would not turn on, so I fearfully looked around the house. Eventually, I made my way into the kitchen. There was no sign of anyone being there... I found the fridge, and when I opened it, a faint light leaked out. I could finally make out my surroundings. And I saw the faint outline of a man huddling in the corner of the room. I tried to tell him that I was lost and I was hoping he'd let me stay until morning, but when I approached him...
The man suddenly screamed, "Stay back!" I apologized and continued to plead my case. "Please, can't you help me?" "I'm not talking to you!" he shouted. I looked at the man in surprise. When I did this, the man asked me... "Can't you see them? Behind you!"
"A horde of faceless men!"
Now then... Since I told a wonderful story that will always haunt you... Would you be so kind as to tip me? If you don't, you might see something really scary.
You're charging us?!
Even haunted houses aren't free, you know!
Sheesh! Let's get out of here!
Huh? Is it over already? I wasn't really listening.
Was that story you just told really true?
Some things are best left unknown... The truth is best carried to the grave...
