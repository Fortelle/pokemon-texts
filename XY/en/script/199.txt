There may be more than one example of the Reveal Glass first found in Unova. That's what the latest research seems to suggest. It's a real breakthrough! Oh, sorry. Don't you know? A Reveal Glass is a mirror that has the ability to transform Landorus, Thundurus, and Tornadus back to their original forms.
Oh! That Pok√©mon with you! That is <var> of legend! Then take this, won't you?
If you use that Reveal Glass, you will be able to turn Tornadus, Thundurus, or Landorus back into its true Forme. Of course, no one really knows whether the Therian Forme or the Incarnate Forme is its true Forme...
