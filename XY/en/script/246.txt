With my wife gone, my life has become very lonely. Would you be so kind as to lend me one of your Pokémon? You know--to keep me company. I hate to be picky, but I'd love to take care of a Pokémon that's Lv. 5 or under.
Oh? You only have one Pokémon with you? Well, I can't take your only Pokémon from you...
I understand. I can tell that your Pokémon are very important to you.
You've made an old man smile! Which Pokémon will you lend me?
Hmm... That Pokémon looks pretty strong. I'd like to take care of a Pokémon that's Lv. 5 or under.
Truly? Will you lend me this Pokémon?
So...do you have a Pokémon for me to take care of?
Wow! So, you're <var>, huh? I hope you don't get too bored keeping company with an old man like me!
<var> is so playful, I feel like I've become younger just by being near it!
But <var> is your pal, right? If you want me to return your Pokémon, I would understand...
Thanks for keeping me company, <var>! You've really brought cheer into an old man's life.
Are you sure? Well, come back anytime if you'd like to check on <var>!
It's a Poké Ball with <var> inside. There's a letter next to it, too. <var> began to read the letter...
Dear <var>,
Dear <var>,
Thanks to the kindness you and your <var> showed me, I was able to keep smiling until the very end. I apologize that I can't look after <var> anymore, but I know you'll take care of it. Finally, please take this <var> as a token of my thanks.
<var> rejoined <var>'s party!
<var> tried to rejoin <var>'s party, but there wasn't enough room!
<var> is inside the Poké Ball!
Hold on a moment. It looks like you don't have enough room for <var>.
Hmm... That right there appears to be an egg! I'd really like to take care of a Pokémon!
