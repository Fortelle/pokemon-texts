Greetings, sirmiss. This is the gate to Route 17.
I sure wish there were Sunflora around Anistar's sundial. Pok√©mon that keep their faces to the sun, and a sundial that keeps time by the sun's travel... Sunlight and shadow at play is sweet to see.
You know what I find interesting? No matter how much scientific progress we make, we may never fully understand everything that happened in the past.
