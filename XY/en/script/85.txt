This Palais Lane actually has two very different faces. One is this easy stroll here, and the other is... Well... I guess you'll find out about that on your way back from the palace.
Hey, Trainer! Yes, you there, young manlady! I'll share an Oran Berry with you.
If you feed an Oran Berry to your Pokémon, it will recover some strength! And if you let your Pokémon hold an Oran Berry, it can eat the Berry during battle!
