Greetings, greetings! As you can see, I am the head of the local chapter of the Pokémon Fan Club here in the Kalos region! It is my proud duty to grant Effort Ribbons to any Pokémon that are clearly making an effort!
Greetings, greetings! Let's see, your <var> is...
Mm-hmm! It is definitely making an effort! However, it will have to work a little harder if it wants to get a special something from me!
It has made a positively tremendous effort! It would look just stunning if you gave it this Effort Ribbon to wear as a reward!
<var> received an Effort Ribbon!
<var> put the Effort Ribbon on hiser <var>!
Ohhh! With that Effort Ribbon, your Pokémon is positively blinding in its radiance, isn't it?
What a lovely little Trainer you are! What kind of Pokémon do you have with you? Oh! Your <var>...
It's amazingly friendly toward you! It must be so happy spending every day with you!
You must really like your <var> and always keep it by your side!
Well, I think you and your <var> will be an even greater combo someday!
It's a little bit friendly to you... Something like that.
Hmmm... I think you have a lot of time ahead of you to get to know one another better.
Don't tell me! Are you just letting it get knocked out in Pokémon battles?!
What's this? Are you a disciplinarian? Or do you plan to use the move Frustration?
Sniffle, snoof...
Chii-cheerp!
Myaaawn...
Gwaaaoh!
