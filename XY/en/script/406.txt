What's cookin', good lookin'? My future Champ, back for more!
The Pokémon Gym here in Lumiose City is just full up of Electric-type Trainers! You can just feel the buzz, am I right? It's also known as a quiz Gym. You're looking a mite quizzical, friend. You want to know why it's called that? Haha! You'll find the answers inside!
For beating the Gym Leader the way you did, we've gone ahead and carved your name into those mysterious-lookin' statues!
Oh, you and <var> are...
Oh, you and <var> are...
Sort of friends, perhaps? Am I right?
Becoming good friends! I can tell!
Pretty good friends! Can I pet it?
Really good friends! I want to play with it!
Really, really good friends! I want to give it Poké Puffs and play with it!
Please cherish your friendship forever and ever!
Really, really good friends! I can tell you've poured your love into it so much! How wonderful!
The shining Prism Tower is like a lighthouse for people's minds... It may look like a waste of energy, but it's important.
Electric-type Pokémon don't have many weaknesses.
