Hi there! You'll find Route 13 right through this gate!
I need to get to Lumiose City, but the gate is closed due to a power outage... How could a power outage happen, anyway? I mean, the Kalos Power Plant is right there on Route 13!
Team Flare was stealing the energy created by Pokémon? What a terrible bunch of thugs they are!


Hey, yo! Take this!
Wanna see something awesome? Try giving Black Sludge to one of your Poison-type Pokémon. You can also totally mess with opponents by using the Trick move to force it on one of their Pokémon that isn't a Poison type.
Did you know that some Pokémon can change their appearance in battle depending on their Ability?
How dare you keep us waiting!
Ha! Just kidding, Trainer! We weren't really waiting for you. We were on our way to the Power Plant at Professor Sycamore's request. But the gate connecting Lumiose City to Route 13 has been shut by a mysterious power outage. We have to investigate.
Hey! So there's Central Kalos and Coastal Kalos, right? Can you tell me what comes next?
I'm just going to give you the answer. It's Mountain Kalos. So I'm going to take this opportunity and power up your Pokédex again.
The Mountain Kalos Pokédex has now been added to <var>'s Pokédex!
The Mountain Kalos Pokédex has been added to your Pokédex menu. Just tap it to check it out, OK?
You know... You look different somehow. Your face seems more...mature? Ha ha! Just joshing with you! I'll be taking my leave now! Bon voyage!
