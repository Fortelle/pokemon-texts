Um... You know... I've never watched fireworks alone with a boy before.
Um... You know... I really hope we get to be great friends, <var>...
We haven't even seen them yet, but I know I'll never forget these fireworks! 'Cause I watched them with you, <var>.
... Wow! That. Was. AMAZING! I never ever want to forget this, so I'll keep this memory in an album in my heart!
And that was my wonderfrou fireworks show for my Furfrou!
I assume you're satisfied with that.
OH!
I almost forgot!
The Poké Flute!
About what?
I just remembered. We need the flute to wake up Snorlax.
That's right! We need the flute to wake up Snorlax.
Sigh... The Poké Flute, huh...
Go get it.
It was Shabboneau Castle's treasure, but I took it as payment for a loan. A rich guy like me and a common person like that just didn't go together.
Give it to them.
Here is the Poké Flute.
Listen well, you two! Always return what you borrow. That's very important.
I want to make lots of memories on my journey... But I think I'll try and forget about him...
You can't imagine how stressful running this place is for him...
That may be so, but... Oh, that's right. Mr. Butler, do you know anything about Mega Evolution?
I remember reading a book on that subject in the palace library. It had something to do with what you'd now call a Trainer holding a mysterious stone high and making Pokémon evolve even further. Also, it's not much, but I would like you to have this.
Protect blocks opposing Pokémon's moves. But if you use it many times in a row, the chances of it not working increase. If you will excuse me. I shall take my leave.
The owner of Shabboneau Castle used to be friends with that guy! Can you believe it? Isn't that crazy?
We have to be sure to give that flute back after we wake up Snorlax...
