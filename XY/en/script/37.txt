Yo, how's it going there? I'm Cassius. Check this out. You know what I'm doing here? I'm keeping the PC Box running! No, seriously! Bill over in Kanto asked me to come here and run things. For real! Enough with the introductions. Get out there, catch some Pokémon, and put 'em in the PC!
Yo, you got something you wanna ask me? I ain't got all day, you know?
Boxes
The Battle Box
Trays
Nothing
Boxes are pretty sweet. You can store up to 30 of your Pokémon in a single Box. You start out with only eight of 'em, but the more Pokémon you deposit, the more Boxes will appear! No, seriously! It's like magic! That's not all, either. You can swap whole Boxes at once if you want. For real!
The Battle Box is no joke, yo! Got Pokémon you use in battle a lot? Put up to six of 'em in the Battle Box. Hold up--I'll explain why. See, if you're having a Link Battle over the Internet, local wireless, infrared connection, or by using the Battle Spot, you can choose to use the Pokémon in your Battle Box instead of the ones in your party. That means you don't have to go to the trouble of moving around Pokémon before a battle. It's crazy convenient! For real!
Trays are totally awesome, dude! They let you select a bunch of Pokémon at a time and move 'em around the PC Box. No, seriously! They're a lifesaver once you've caught a lot of Pokémon.
They got PCs in every Pokémon Center, right? Boot one up, and you can edit your Trainer PR Videos. No, seriously!
Take this, Thief!
With the Thief move, you can take the target's held item while dealing damage to it! It won't work if the user is already holding an item, though.



It's a server rack. There's a PC, too!
