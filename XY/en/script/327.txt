Welcome! How are you doing? I'll give you a bargain, so please come again!
Good day. Please relax here to your heart's content...
I also want to run this café. Because it's a place where wonderful people like you come, <var>!

I'm tasting everyone's café crème to see which is the most delicious.
Well now. Have you visited all of the cafés in Lumiose as well?
There sure are a lot of people behind the counter at this café...
