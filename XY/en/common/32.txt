Have we met or not? I don't really remember. Well, I guess it's nice to meet you anyway!
Yahoo! YAHOO! I did it! I won again!
No way... NO WAY! How could I lose again...
All right! Here I come! I'll show you my power!
You amazed? You surprised? By the power of my Pokémon?!
Whoa! You are incredible! I'm amazed and surprised!
B-b-bonjour, Dresseur! B-battle, s'il vous plaît!
Merci bien!
Aw, sh-shucks!
Don't let your guard down, or you may be crying when a kid beats you.
I may be young, but that doesn't mean I'll lose--even to a grown-up.
Sheesh! Can't you see that I'm just a kid! It wasn't fair of you to go all out like that!
Let's have a fun Pokémon battle!
Hehe! Mehehehehe! See? It's fun to win!
That was pretty amazingly fun! You've totally exhausted me...
A serious battle starts from a serious beginning! Are you sure you're ready?
Seriously, winning a serious battle is seriously the best!
Seriously, I lost. That is, like, seriously depressing, but you were seriously cool.
You'd better go easy on me, OK? Though I'll be seriously fighting!
I can't believe I won! Wait... Did you seriously go easy on me?
Hey! I told you to go easy on me! Still, you're pretty cool when you're serious.
Um, um, um, you know what? These Pokémon are my friends.
I...I'm sorry. I just wanted to show you my friends...
Just being with my Pokémon makes me happy, so it's OK!
...Heehee. I'm confident in my calculations and analysis.
Heheh. Exactly as I planned... There's no way I would lose.
Ohhhh... Calculation and analysis are perhaps no match for chance...
We're about to battle, but that doesn't mean we can't be polite! Good luck!
That could have gone better, but I do thank you very much.
I feel like crying in frustration, but I do thank you very much.
I've been studying every single day, so I'm taking a break for a change.
You see, playing with Pokémon is fun. I want to study Pokémon.
Ah, my Pokémon lost... Maybe I'll stick to studying.
I want to be a Pokémon researcher when I grow up.
Do you think Pokémon research projects need any test subjects?
I must do my best to learn even more about Pokémon.
Ah... You look strong... I hope I'll be all right...
Oops, you weren't as strong as I expected. Looks can be deceiving.
I could tell you are a strong Trainer! What you see is what you get, right?
I always get the best grades! I aim to be number one in everything!
I will keep winning and winning and winning... I will be number one!
If I lose at such an early stage, I can't be number one...
Wha--? You wanna battle with me? I suppose we could arrange something...
Ah, I shoulda known. Hey, don't blame me.
Oh, wh-whoa. I'm no match for you. Your Pokémon are somethin' else.
Grumble, grumble...
Grumble, grumble... Huh? Did I win?
Grumble, grumble... Oh? Was that it?
Here I am, a master of the universe, a mover and shaker of the future!
The class differences always tell. I'm worried about your future, kid.
I really let myself get carried away this time. I hope it doesn't affect my future prospects.
Are you my opponent? You look kind of hungry.
Hmm. Have you been eating well? Can't fight on an empty stomach!
Are you sure you're normal? What in the world do you eat?
I am a nouveau riche celebrity, so I am stingy with my money!
Unfortunately, you've lost to me. Now, give me your lunch money!
I lost, but I won't give you my lunch money!
My mom chose my Pokémon. I don't think they'll lose to you.
You see that? I'll be fine as long as I listen to my mom.
Mommy! Mama-a-a! Waaah! Make the mean Trainer go away!
Ahhh, a Trainer who looks gorgeous! I hope your battle is just as beautiful.
Such a looker lost to me?! I'm a little disappointed.
Oh my, our battle was just as gorgeous. I feel drawn to you.
What kind of Pokémon do you like? Hey, come on, show me!
Your taste in Pokémon is wonderful, but you are a disappointment as a Trainer.
Your taste in Pokémon is truly awful, but you are a first-class Trainer!
I'm sorry--I've been lying. I'm not really a rich girl.
Everybody paid more attention to me when I pretended to be rich.
The truth is that I'm nothing more than the daughter of a Clerk ♂.
Ahahaha!
Ahahaha!!!
Ahaha-argh...
Preschooler gonna battle you! Oh yeah! Nice to meet you.
Little baby is a winna! Tank you! Tank you!
Da Preschooler lost! Tank you anyways!
I am a genius Preschooler! I'm already prepping for college.
You lost to a Preschooler... And how old are you again?
I'm confident in studying, but I'm just a beginner in Pokémon battles.
I am the hero! I refuse to lose!
I AM the hero! I beat a villain!
A hero never loses. A hero never dies.
I am very strong. I will never lose.
Daddy gave me my Pokémon! They've gotta be the strongest!
WAAAH!
No pouting when you lose, 'cause that's just lame.
I'm so happy, I could c-cry! Yip-yip-yippeee!
Awww, s-sniff! I losted on my battle... It's sad, but I s'pose it's my fault.
Are you gonna pick on me?
You didn't pick on me. So I guess I like you!
You did pick on me, after all, but I like you 'cause you're strong!
Game on, Pokémon! Give it all you've got!
Mmmm-hahaha! Yahoo! Yahoo! Thank you very much, Pokémon!
Booooo! Come on, Pokémon! Try harder!
I am four years old! I will do my best! Trainer, you should do your best, too!
I'm four years old! I did my best! Trainer, you were really weak.
I'm four years old! I did my best! Trainer, you did your best, too!
Lalalala... Lalalala... I am a loner...
Lalalala... Lalalala... Drifting like clouds...
Lalalala... Lalalala... Till we meet again...
I am not just an ordinary Backpacker, 'cause I'm also a newlywed, you see!
My new wife and I are hitchhiking for our honeymoon, 'cause we have no money.
This is my honeymoon! B-but... But I've lost my wife somewhere...
Hitchhiking around the region without a cent to your name has its own charm.
See? Travel is best when you're young and poor.
Argh... I'm so hungry... Can you please spare something...
It's no holds barred on this journey! Where's my adventure?!
My journey... No, my adventure of a lifetime hasn't even begun yet!
The journey isn't over. Just you wait! I'll show you the greatest adventure ever!
The truth is that I'm a time traveler. I just popped by from the future.
Even if I lose, I can just jump in my time machine and go back to the past to try a battle again!
Yes, traveling through time... That's how I go!
You know, the prices in this region are really quite something, aren't they!
Though the level of the Trainers in this region... Well, they're nothing worth writing home about.
I couldn't possibly live in a country where everything costs so much!
Sometimes I need a little time to rest. I'm gonna take it easy this battle, OK?
That was a nice and easy win. I'll work hard again tomorrow!
That was supposed to be refreshing, but now I feel more stressed out.
All I want is to work hard, save my money, and live a quiet life.
Everybody has a different dream. I just want to have a normal life.
I'd rather simply have security and happiness than chase a big dream.
Hey! Welcome! I've got some real plump and lively Pokémon right here!
What do you think of my Pokémon? They're fresh!
Thanks for coming! What'd you think? Did my Pokémon suit your tastes?
Didn't you come here for a Pokémon battle?
Don't be scared, or you will never win.
You are a strong Trainer. Forgive my impertinence.
Hiya, honey! Welcome, welcome! Have you decided what you'll have?
Order up! One humiliation in a Pokémon battle, over easy.
Order up! One glorious victory in a Pokémon battle, sunny-side up.
Meow, meow, I can haz battle, meow? (Ugh, I really sound like a fool, don't I?)
Yeah! Meow! I haz victory, meow! (I seriously want to quit this job.)
Meowww... I haz lost, meowww. (This job is sooo embarrassing.)
My love for Pokémon is stronger than anybody else's. Love can do anything.
This victory proves my true love for Pokémon.
Love should conquer all. Love should've helped me win...right?
Oh, do you want to see the Pokémon I am proudest of?
What do you think about my dear Pokémon? Great, right?
Oh my goodness! My poor Pokémon...
Here I go! I battle for the honor of the branch office!
I am a branch manager of the Pokémon Fan Club--and I won!
Urk! F-farewell for now! I'll remember this, child!
I lost a lot of things because I love Pokémon too much...
I have devoted my life to Pokémon. I see things differently than you do.
I cannot win even with my devotion. What shall I do?!
Listen, I love Pokémon more than life itself!
I'll be a Pokémon in my next life.
I love your Pokémon, too! Please, let me pet them!
I'm not good at battling, but this is one of the duties of a Poké Fan.
I've kept the honor of the Poké Fan alive. Hahaha!
Cheers, all you Poké Fans out there! May the Poké Fan last forever!
My middle-age spread has given me as much gravitas as the mountains I hike!
Bwahaha! You'll win, too, if you just up your calorie intake a bit!
At least I cannot lose when it comes to BMI!
I am no mere Hiker. Call me an alpinist.
A mountain maniac like me is properly called an alpinist.
A specialist in mountainous matters. That's an alpinist.
I'm bursting with dreams and desires! I'm just a bundle of youthful vigor!
Dreams are important! Desires are important!
I'm so full of dreams and desires that I'm about to burst! But that's what it means to be young!
Is it really OK? Do you really think someone like me can be a Trainer?
No way... I'm actually pretty good! Or are you just a total amateur?
Ahhh... I knew I'd be terrible at it... I can't call myself a Trainer like this...
Anyone can stay young if they keep stars in their eyes and dreams in their hearts!
I won't tell you how old I really am, but I can say I'm old enough to be your mother!
All you have to do is ignore reality, and you can stay young forever, too.
If it's cute, fluffy Pokémon you want, leave it to me!
A harmony of strength and cuteness... That's what I'm all about!
A fragile ephemerality... Yes, that's another of my charms...
My dear cuties whisper all kinds of secrets to me...
You see? My cuties teach me all kinds of good things.
Why don't my cuties say anything? Why do they seem in such a bad temper?
I won't be going easy on you just because you're a kid. Bring it on!
Heh. You can't do battle if you're afraid of losing.
Harrumph. I'm still weak. I pity my Pokémon...
I may be bad and stupid, but I'm serious about Pokémon.
I only really feel at peace when I'm with Pokémon.
I hope you'll find something you can be serious about.
My amazing punk hair is the secret to my power.
The more I spike my hair, the stronger I am!
If you want to be even stronger, you should get amazing punk hair, too!
What d'you think you're lookin' at?! You've got some kind of nerve, kid!
A hard chick like me doesn't need anybody else to fight! My Pokémon are all the backup I need!
Amazin'! I got schooled from here to Hoenn! You gotta take me under your wing, boss!
I'm Callisto, the boss of the Kalos Coalition. It'd be my pleasure to take you on in battle!
Phew... You've got some good Pokémon on your side, all right.
Well, ain't you something... All right, then. I'm stepping down--you're the new boss!
The guy I like is, like, totally bad... I'm gonna be real bad for that cad...
The gals of the Kalos region, like yeah... Ooh, ooh, ooh, we battle, ooh yeah...
Gals of Kalos don't take it on the chin... Ooh, ooh, ooh, you'll regret this win...
Non, non! A dash of defeat is not called for in my recipe book! C'est pas possible!
Ouais! Where is the life? Where is the vigor? It would not even tempt a half-starved Skitty!
Bon sang! What spice! What kick you have! You must tell me your secret ingredient!
S-so you've come to challenge me! Get too close, and I will sauté you!
It...it...it's all your fault for challenging me! Next time I'll turn you into a tasty concasse!
Stop! Just hold on a moment! I don't want to be flambéed!
In the land of feasting, I am king! Nay, I am the Emperor of Eating!
Ahhh, the Emperor of Eating is satiated! I polished off your Pokémon in no time!
I-I give up my seat as Emperor of Eating... Take care of my precious land of feasting...
Wanna give me a hand with my training? It's all for the sake of my future dreams!
Your defeat is another small step toward my dreams coming true!
What! B-b-but my future... Have you seriously considered what defeat will do to my future?!
Talent? Hah! It's just a convenient excuse lazy Trainers use to explain away their losses.
Talent is not something that can be gained, and strength grows weak if it is not used.
So-called talent is no more than an illusion... The efforts of one's own are all that is real.
In the words of an ancient warrior, "Conquer the self, and you will conquer the opponent."
What do you wish to do now? Shall I leave and relieve you of your shame?
Ahhhh! What a crock! If I can't even conquer you, then who cares about conquering myself?!
I'm gonna give it my all. It's only natural! You can only get results by doing battle!
How does it feel to lose? Obviously, I wouldn't know.
Whether you give it your all or slack off... All that matters in the end is who wins...
Hmph! I'm no servant of yours!
No one but my master will ever make me bow!
U-ugh... Rather strong, aren't you? I suppose I might not mind serving you...
Are your preparations complete? I would like to ask you for a battle.
A strength equal to that of my master... I look forward to your future progress.
Oh no, what a disgrace! I'm sure my master will dock my pay for this.
The master I was serving disappeared one day. Now I am a masterless Butler--a ronin retainer!
Oh, Master, where art thou?
A Butler without a master is really no more than a meddlesome old man.
Oh no! I forgot to take off my uniform before I came!
Wow! Seriously? I won a battle?! There's no way I'm going back now!
Ahhhhh! And I lost! This is not my day.
You know, I am very popular thanks to this costume of mine.
Being popular is simple. I like life to be simple.
It feels good to be popular, but sometimes I feel achingly empty.
Welcome, good sirfair lady. Shall I take your coat for you?
You must be tired. Please do rest awhile.
That was superb, sirmiss! You are strong indeed.
I used to be popular, but now I am all washed up.
I was overwhelmed by success. I took it for granted, and I didn't work hard.
As times change, values also change. I realized that too late.
Well, well, you strike impressive poses. If you lose, I hope you'll model for me.
I'll do a sketch of you as you are now, frustrated by failure. Please hold still.
Please wait! I'm sure I can create a masterpiece with you as my model!
Sensitivity is important for battles, too. You! Start feeling right now!
You need to feel it more! More! Or you'll never win!
Ah! I sense it! I sense your hypersensitive sensitivity!
Action painting? That's, like, so last century. Art today is all about inaction.
Inaction doesn't mean do nothing! Did you hug an Electrode with the Static Ability or something?
Inaction may be the rage for art, but maybe it's not such a great strategy for battling...
Inspiration... I need inspiration... Someone, please, inspire me!
Ah! My muse! She has not abandoned me! I can feel it coming--the inspiration I need!
Hah... Hah... No, not yet! I still need more inspiration!
I dabbled in art like I dabble in Pokémon! Dabbling is what keeps me from the rabble!
Hee hee hee! That was quite the scrabble! Even if you weren't very good, I still enjoyed it!
You may think I'm just babbling, but I sure love my artistic dabbling!
I'll show you we can break you. We've been training in the field!
How were my Pokémon? Powerful, weren't they?
How strange... How could this be... I shouldn't have been outmuscled.
Oh, you look lively! What d'ya say we battle?
OK! We're all done here! How were my partners?
My goodness, you are so young! My partners were crushed!
Pokémon battles after work are the one joy in my life.
Ahhhhhhhhh! Yes, that hits the spot! This is why I can't give up Pokémon.
Urrrrrrrgh... You got me good! I'm single... Battling is my only pleasure in life.
Pokémon are popular at work, too. Even us guys enjoy these battles!
Aren't I good for a guy who just battles during his lunch breaks?
Old guys and kids can both enjoy battling with Pokémon.
I've trained and trained myself without stopping, so now I'm as fast as the wind!
No one can stop me now that I'm as fast as the wind itself!
Ow! Ow! Ow! My face! I'm the poster child for windburn!
I pledge myself now to the great roller spirits! My love, my hopes, my vow... It's all for you!
It's like some sort of dream. Shall I embrace this, too, great roller spirits?
Skates alive! What a battle!
Who was it?! Who's the bad-mouther who said that I'm just barely skating by, huh?!
I would never just skate by in battle! Even if I am wearing Roller Skates!
I-I can't even skate by anymore? That's it... I'm done. I'm retiring.
I've skated all the way here today! Over fields, mountains, and valleys!
That's right! If you only have a pair of Roller Skates, you can go anywhere!
Hah... Hah... All that skating... It really took it...out of me...
Halt, fool! I am the guardian of this castle's gardens! A ninja of nature!
Bwahahahah! My Pokémon's ninja skills are without equal!
Gasp! What maliciousness was in that move?! I see. So you must also be a ninja...
Stop! I'm going to have to ask you not to move. Just sit back and see what I do with my shears!
What a shame. It looks like I've dulled my precious pruning shears on an ordinary weed.
You have shown quite the cutting prowess... I shall sharpen my shears to face you again.
If you don't have great Pokémon, you'll never have a great battle.
It seems like you don't even understand how great your Pokémon could be.
It looks like I didn't properly appreciate how great my own Pokémon could have been...
My last ever battle... That's the way I'd like us to view this match...
We will meet again someday... Heh. If only that were true...
It's been fun... Let's have another last battle again someday...
My disciples cover the world! I am the owningest of Owners!
I can own any Owners, after all. I can't be defeated that easily.
Sacre bleu! As of this day, you've owned the Owner of all Owners!
Having carte blanche only leads to disaster. No, I was never well suited to be an Owner.
Victory is a shallow and fleeting illusion. Your eventual defeat is a fait accompli.
They say with age comes wisdom, but that never seems to have worked for me.
Adults have learned a lot of things kids don't get. Like what is right...and what is fair...
Let me guess... You spend a lot of time blaming adults for things you think aren't "fair," don't you?
Getting older is a one-way ticket. I regret nothing!
I've recently remade my life completely! I've been reborn as a Beauty at last!
If you want to make your dreams reality, then you have to be completely dedicated!
Yes, a mere half year ago I was a Black Belt! Quite the transformation, wouldn't you say?
It's only the first day of my honeymoon trip...and I'm already missing home.
Enough already! I just want to go home! I miss my mother!
Sob... Sob... Who needs this? I'm going home to my mother!
Are you lost here? Are you lost here? Brother John, Brother John.
Winning bells are ringing, winning bells are ringing. Ding ding dong! Ding ding dong!
Now my head is ringing, now my head is ringing. Ding ding dong! Ding ding dong!
It's my honeymoon! I'm on my honeymoon! I'm definitely not a crazy lady traveling alone!
A-and I'm on my honeymoon, you got that?! That's the most important point to remember!
I-I've got a husband... No, really, I do... Because this is my honeymoon...see?
Hoard your money, then spend it all shopping! We're making the economy move here, people!
If you don't work, you can't shop till you drop! I work hard so I can waste my money like this!
Though I guess I should probably be buying local...
A true Monsieur should have a liking for battles.
A true Monsieur should bask in the elegant glow of his victory.
A true Monsieur should accept the results of battle with a stoic mind.
I will evaluate your ability.
Hmm... As a Trainer, you are at the level of a Preschooler.
Hmm... As a Trainer, you are at the level of a Poké Fan.
You can learn much from a mature woman, such as wisdom, grace, and good manners.
Woo-hoo! Take that! Were you knocked out by this Madame's charm, or what?!
Did you enjoy the battle with me?
Ah-roo! Let us have an elegant and unique battle.
Ah-roo-goo-lah! I was not confident of my skills, so this is a delightful surprise.
Ooh la la! I'll pay you back for this someday!
Obedient Pokémon, selfish Pokémon... Pokémon have unique characteristics.
You should not get angry at your Pokémon, even if you lose a battle.
It is important to nurture and train each Pokémon's characteristics.
Hmm, do you discipline your Pokémon? Pampering them too much is no good.
No matter how much you love your Pokémon, you still have to discipline them when they misbehave.
Too much praise can spoil both Pokémon and people.
Pokémon never betray you. They return all the love you give them.
This proves my Pokémon have accepted my love.
It's about time for me to give a human my affection, though.
Shall I give you a tip for training good Pokémon?
The real trick behind training good Pokémon is catching good Pokémon.
You don't seem to need any tips for training good Pokémon.

Hello-how-are-ya? Are ya in good form? I'm Nita. Welcome to the Battle Maison, pet. Sure, I may be the youngest of us four Battle Chatelaine sisters, but I'm still a class Trainer. I've been an owner of the Battle Maison this long while. Honest, I'm not telling fibs! I'd be in charge of the Single Battles myself. Would you do me a favor? Of a bit of a match? You will? Grand! Then let's begin at once!
Would you look at the cut of me Pokémon! What a battle, and me not trying for real even! Oh, I'm scarlet for you, pet. Made a complete and utter hash o' that one, didn't you now? But get you a bit more training, and you'll be grand. Trust me, training's your only man. The Battle Maison and Nita are both here and waiting for a challenge every day o' the year! We'll always be waiting for you! See you then!
That was great fun! En't you a jammie one! But I'll tell you nicely, did I not hold back... Well... G'wan with you! If I were to pull out all the stops, it'd be none too nice for our guests, eh. My older sisters are always on at me about that! Sure, I let you have a win this time... But if you seriously want to battle against me, you wouldn't be goin' astray to train up a bit more. Thanks a mill! You come back again sometime!
Uh-umm... W-welcome to the Battle Maison... My name is Evelyn... I'll t-try t-t-to serve you as a Battle Chatelaine like my sisters, so... I'm the th-third of us four. M-my specialty is... Double Battles... I guess... Umm... ... ... ... Th-the weather is in a lovely way today, isn't it? ... ... ... Oh, please! I'm sorry, but... Please s-start the battle already!
I'm s-s-so sorry! I didn't m-mean for anything like this to... It wasn't supposed to happen like this! I would have lost, I would! Oh no... I'm supposed to make sure that our fine guests have a grand time! Sniffle... Sniffle... S-sob... I'm so sorry... I'll be sure to r-really lose next time... So please... Please come and challenge me to a Double Battle again...
O-oh! Fair play! You're quite strong, aren't you, guest! Now that I've seen how strong you are, I feel I shouldn't have held back. It's just that my elder sisters had asked me to take it a bit easy on new guests... The next time that we battle, I will try much harder to beat you! P-please continue to patronize the Battle Maison... And to challenge me!
Welcome to the Battle Maison! I'm Dana. Thank you for coming. I am the second eldest of the four sisters who run this Battle Maison. I am also a Triple Battle expert! So come at me, young challenger! Yes, the extent of your strength... I will be weighing it in a moment!
My, my, my... What a pity. Is that the end of things for you? I thought you had potential, but you can't get blood from a stone, after all. Away with you! I'm not interested in wasting time with weak Trainers! If that's difficult for you to accept, come back and dare to challenge me again. And if you're just going to give up, then why not just run home now to lick your wounds in shame?
Gasp...gasp... That was quite...the performance... Truly... You and your Pokémon...are truly... Ehh, leave it out! Let's drop the act. Good ladgirl, yourself. That's the best trouncin' I've had in ages. Sure, in ages! In fairness, I put on a bit of a show for the guests. But I can't act so high 'n' mighty after a savage battle like that one. Now, you leg it this instant before I consider fighting ye again right now! Away ye go and keep on winning! 'Cause if ye do... I'll show ye my real skills. Ye'd do well to mind yerself then!
If you're free for a time, come on by. ♪ If you're bored for a while, stop on in. ♪ Battle till you burst, oh, won't you try. ♪ If you want to battle, the Battle Maison's fine. ♪ Hee! What do you think of our song, my ladyoung missie? We had it written just for our wee Battle Maison. Music can be a lovely distraction. Don't you agree? Oh, me. I've not even introduced myself, have I? Well, don't bite my head off! I'm the eldest of the four Battle Chatelaine sisters. Do call me Morgan. We all thank you for coming to visit our cherished Battle Maison today. I tell you, I may not be a first-class Trainer, but I'll put everything I have into treating you to the loveliest battle you've ever known!
Thank you for the battle, love! Did you have a bit of fun yourself? I do hope you might find your way to stop by our BP shops as you go. We have cracking good souvenirs for remembering your time here at the Battle Maison. I'll be taking me leave now, but I do look forward to your next visit.
Thank you for the battle, love! Did you have a bit of fun yourself? Get out of the garden! I had no idea you were such a fine Trainer! It's not just that you're fearsome strong, though you are, of course. You have real style to you, too! Heh heh! I've taken quite a shine to you, my fine ladgirl! But, unfortunately, we've run out of time for our wee battle today. I wait with bated breath for the next time you come to challenge me!
Welcome to the Battle Maison! I'm Dana. Thank you for coming. I am the second eldest of the four sisters who run this Battle Maison. I will praise your bravery, at least, in attempting a Multi Battle with me! And, of course, I am hardly alone! ... ... ... Oh, give me a break, Evelyn! It's your line next! Come on!
Dana: Oh, goodness me. Isn't this a shame? It looks like you're finished already. Well, at least you weren't any worse than I had already expected you to be... Don't you agree? Evelyn? ... ... ... Oh, for pity's sake, Evelyn! Wake up! I'm morto for them and you! Honest!
Dana: Ugh... You're not bad, that's for certain... To think that you would be able to break through our perfect combo... But my real stage is the Triple Battle! And Evelyn's speciality is Double Battle! If you took either of us on in our own specialties, we'd never lose to you! Isn't that right, Evelyn?!
I-I-I'm sorry, Dana... U-um, my name is Evelyn... I-I-I'm usually in charge of Double Battles... ... ... ... U-um...so...well... I'm not all flash like my sister Dana when it comes to talking... ... ... ... U-umm! Please! I'm sorry, but... Please start the battle already!
Evelyn: Huh? Wha-what? D-did you say something, Dana? I-I was so nervous...that I don't remember a thing o' the battle. Sniff...sniffle... Oh, I am scarlet for myself... U-umm...I... I... I... Th-thank you for the battle! P-please visit the Battle Maison again! N-now...excuse me!
Evelyn: Wh-wha... Well, I never said... I-I don't really think I'm all that good at Double Battles either... A-and the reason that we just lost was because I'm so slow... S-so I don't think these guests should expect much from me... I'd look a bit silly... Please... Pick anything but Double Battle... N-now then... I'll excuse myself... Thank you for the battle...
W-w-welcome... To the B-Battle Maison... U-um... We would like to thank you...for choosing a Multi Battle today... S-so...um... You will be facing my elder sister Morgan and me, Evelyn, today...
Evelyn: Th-th-thank you very much! Y-your Pokémon were brilliant! I-I will also work hard, so you'll never be stuck for a challenge... So please... Come to visit us at the Battle Maison again...
Evelyn: Um, fair play, you two! You were both so very strong! Th-the truth is I was nervous facing two strangers at the same time. So I don't know what I did... B-but I will try even harder the next time that we have a Multi Battle... So please d-do definitely ask me to join you in a Multi Battle again.
Evelyn? Are you ready to begin? Are you nervous again, pet? Remember, it is very important to greet our precious guests... I know some of these goofs like it when you waffle about, so that's fine for business, but... ... ... ...Hmm? Oh? Oh! Were you earwigging? What a cheeky bit you are! I should not have been discussing personal matters in front a guest. L-let's just get straight to the battle, shall we? And not before time! Evelyn and I will do our very best, though we're both quite hopeless at this!
Morgan: Oh, good on you, both of you two! Did you enjoy our wee little combo? I've two other younger sisters, sure, in addition to my shy Evelyn here. If you happen to meet either of them, I trust they'll show you a good time. We'll all be looking forward to your next visit then! Don't work too hard!
Morgan: Oh, good on you, both of you! Did you enjoy our little combo? Our Evelyn is quite reserved, so she gets a wee bit nervous in these big battles. But she'd take you on handily in a Double Battle! I hope you'll claim a Double Battle with her soon. And of course I'd be tickled meself to see you in one of my Rotation Battles. We'll all be looking forward to your next visit, then! Don't work too hard!
Glad you made it! It won't be an easy job from here.
Haha! What'd I tell ya? You're not ready yet.
I got a little carried away earlier, but what job was I talking about?
Both my mom and my dad are Ace Trainers. I'm probably an Ace, too!
I want to be a real Ace like my mom and dad.
Waaah! I should have superior genes and be able to ride on my parents' coattails...
I don't mind your lack of focus, but you will get no sympathy from me if you lose.
Ah, you see? You didn't focus on the battle. That's why you lost.
That's quite enough focusing. Stop staring at me like that!
Father... Mother... Watch over my battle...
Father... Mother... Did you see? I won a battle... I really won!
Father... Mother... What should I do?
I came here to goof off. I don't want to cram for the big test...
I can't lose now... I don't want to study anymore!
No! I don't want to go home! I don't want to have to study!
I just want to be successful and grow rich someday.
My dream is simply to be rich.
I will be rich someday and put you to shame.
I don't care who you are or where you come from.
How should we act and react? That is all that matters, isn't it?
A label is not important, is it? After all, you are yourself, right?
Pokémon battles and study sessions are much the same. Let's be efficient!
You are too inefficient. You need to be more quick and responsive.
How did I lose against such a slacker? I can't believe it!
I have more money than I know what to do with. There's nothing I really want.
The only thing I enjoy is a Pokémon battle...
Just because I'm rich, it doesn't mean I'm happy.
Yes! I'm a Rich Boy!
Good-bye! You've been beaten by a Rich Boy!
Thank you! Merci bien! You've beat a Rich Boy!
I just battle for fun, but I'll do my best.
Well, I only won by chance. Please don't pay it any mind.
It's good to battle for fun. If it's too serious, you won't enjoy it...
Yesterday was a party. Today is a battle. I'm rich--I always have fun!
I've never done a day of work, because I'm loaded with cash.
No work and all play makes me a dull girl. Do you think I don't know that?
Go, my precious Pokémon! To battle! Rush the enemy!
My Pokémon are the mightiest! I shall carve my name in history!
I won't cry... I won't. Someday, I will win.
I came here for my big brother who always hides in his room.
My big brother, look outside for once! I won for you! So come out and play!
I wish my big brother would come out of his room and play with me...
Hello, me old china, time for the rhyma!
Bit of a Pokémon read and write, Trainer, many clinks!
Even though I lost, I'll be fine. Best of luck, Trainer!
All Mom and Dad do is mumble at their computers! It's no fun!
I don't like Mom or Dad or their silly computers! All I need are Pokémon!
I wish they would talk to me instead of their computers...
A globe-trotting young adventurer. That's me!
Seeing Pokémon from all over the world is the purpose of my journey.
Adventure is calling me. Farewell! See you again!
Let's take it easy with Pokémon and with life.
It's OK to bust your tail. But you need some breathing room, too.
No problem. No problem. I'll have another chance.
Eww, don't tell me this is one of THOSE regions. You expect me to tip the plebs?
Hmph! Looks like no tip is necessary. Then I guess this region isn't all bad.
Tsk! I'm not paying any tip, you hear?
Every time I travel, I find myself thinking the same thing. Do you know what it is?
That in the end, east or west, home is best.
That if your life can really be changed by traveling, you haven't been living it right.
I'll always work part-time, 'cause it lets me focus on what I really love.
You only ever get one life to live. Are you doing what you want to do?
I want to play here forever without being tied down.
I took this job because I wanted to see smiles on people's faces.
Oh... Don't look at me like that. Smile! Smile!
Losing is frustrating, but I'm glad I saw you smile.
Let's start the battle! Time's a-wasting!
What? Is it already over? We still have lots of time.
WHAT?! It's already time? And we can't go into overtime!
I'm battling here to promote the café that I'm working at.
You're not that strong, so we don't need you in our café.
Yowza! What a strong Trainer! Come to my café next time, OK?
Join the Pokémon Fan Club! Your life will be happy!
If you join the Pokémon Fan Club, you'll be strong, like me!
If you join the Pokémon Fan Club, your life will be saved!
I am not a regular Poké Fan. I am a major mega-Poké Fan!
I love Pokémon... I love, love, love Pokémon!
Remember this, you! I am a big Poké Fan!
I think I am a Poké Fan, therefore I am a Poké Fan.
The Poké Fan is power.
You should remember this: I am a Poké Fan.
There are young and beautiful people, but youth is different from beauty.
If I'd only known that when I was young, I wouldn't be having such a hard time now...
Youth is just youth. I wish I had realized it back then.
Ho there! You are a mountain standing in my way, aren't ya?
Yahoo! Yahooooo!! Hear my cry of triumph!
Grrr... My victory has disappeared down into some dark crevasse...
Hi! Sorry to keep you waiting! I'm a Hiker with a cult following!
Oh no! It's over already? The Hiker hunk is bored!!
This is important, so remember it: don't judge a book by its cover!
Even if it's tough, even if it's painful, I'mma do it! I'm a Trainer, dagnabbit!
I was born to do battle, ya hear?! I'm a darn tootin' Trainer! I am!
Blast it all! And it's all mah own fault! I've gotta apologize to mah sweet Pokémon!
Just because they're both decided by who wins and who loses, don't liken a battle to a game!
Fair play? What're you talking about? Is that some kind of loser thing?
This...this can't be... How could I be beaten at my own game...
My wovely widdle Pokémon are gonna take you apart, mmkay?
Don't you worry your silly widdle head! I'll take away ALL your pain, mmkay?
Oh phooey! Don't you ever come back! If you do, we're gonna end you, mmkay?
Like a fragment of a forgotten dream, a mysterious Pokémon beckons to you...
Shhh. Rest now and close your eyes... You won't ever need open them again...
Being defeated by you makes this waking world seem even less believable than my dreams...
Everyone should just disappear! I don't need anyone but Pokémon!
Humans should be gone from this world! I don't like anything or anyone but Pokémon!
Wh-why do my Pokémon look like they are having so much fun battling you?
You have your way. And I have my way.
I will go my way because I don't have any other way.
Your way must be rocky. Good luck to you. I am behind you all the way.
Hey, you! Don't mess with me, or I will destroy your Pokémon!
Thought you might make trouble for me, but what a wimpy attack!
How could I lose to such a wimpy move? Gaaahhh, that bugs the snot out of me!
My dad and mom are both Veterans, but I am a loser...
I wonder if my mom and dad will be sad if they see that I've become a Punk Guy.
I can't be like my mom and dad. So I've gotta live as a Punk Guy.
Y'know, the truth is I really wanna be a normal girl and be all lovey-dovey with a normal boyfriend...
Sniffle... Maybe it's 'cause I'm so stupidly strong that no normal boys come near me...
I just want a boyfriend! No, not just any boyfriend-- I want a silly boyfriend I can be lovey-dovey with!
Man, the bad things I used to get up to... I've done a little of this and whole lotta that.
This, that, and the other were like my thing, you know what I'm saying?
But I guess that this and that are two totally different things, huh?
You wanna fight me? You do know I come from a long line of punks, right? You've got guts, at least.
I'll let you go this time. Get stronger, then come back and fight me again.
Heh... I regret nothing... It was a fight worth my family's honor...
I'm warning you now--if you lose to me, you'll be smelling the rank scent of defeat!
Mm-hmm! So fragrant! Such a bouquet! Let me get another whiff of victory!
Hm, hm, hm! There was no avoiding it! Your Pokémon give off a real aroma of victory!
I, the great Dariole, fear nothing under the sky!
Mehehehehe... You fool! You know not your place!
Feh! I will at least admit that you have a skill for feigning strength.
"Une apple a day keeps ze doctor away." Are you familiahr with zis saying?
You are what you eat, n'est-ce pas? And it seems you could use a pinch of ze winning.
If you want to win, ze whining, it will not help! Neizer will ze wurst, I'm afraid...
Y-you... How can this be... It is like seeing my former master alive in the flesh again!
Thank goodness... In terms of strength, at least, you have little resemblance to my former master.
Even your strength is just as my master's was! P-please! Allow me to serve at your side!
The International Butlering Competition is drawing near, so allow me to practice my skills on you!
Now, let's see... If I accidentally beat my master... I know! I get on my knees and beg for forgiveness!
Now, let's see... If my master easily defeats me... I know! That is the ideal moment for some flattery!
Always workin' me to the bone, like I ain't even worth their time of day or nuttin'!
What a waste! If only I could beat those rich jerks I work for this nice and easy!
What a bunch of louts! Don't they even get that I'm always working my tail off over here!
Talk is unnecessary... I will just break you...
What? Are you broken already?
Ugh, I'm broken...
I have very low self-esteem, so I like having someone else give me orders.
Well, you're not my master, so I guess you can't help being weak.
Ohhh... Could you please give me an order?
This isn't a uniform--it's just what I like to wear. I made it myself.
This is a uniform from an anime. Doesn't it look good on me?
I wish I could live in the worlds that I see in games, anime, and comics.
I'm not cut out for a regular job, so I make my living on art.
I envy Pokémon, 'cause they're so carefree. I want to be a Pokémon.
Bah! If I could do a regular job, I'd quit this stinking art in a second.
Every time a Pokémon uses a move, my heart trembles!
Nothing stirs the soul like Pokémon moves.
Aha! Pokémon moves are so beautiful! I could almost faint!
I will make you cry, 'cause you just don't know when to quit.
A state of deep sorrow and confusion can also be art.
Someday, you will appreciate the value of defeat and sorrow.
(This kid looks like a real sucker. All right!) Ohhhh, poor me! No one understands my art...
I'd love to do a painting of you, you know. (Because I could sell it for a mint! Hah!)
Please come to the gallery to see my works! (You look dumb enough to buy something!)
The battle between us two... Within and of itself, that is art.
Yes... I shall name this piece... "The Pitiful and Somehow Unsightly Youth."
Yes... I shall name this piece... "The Tragic and Yet Alluringly Beautiful Artist"!
I collect the random scribbles of Pokémon, then sell 'em as "art." I'm makin' a fortune over here!
It's like stealin' candy from a baby! I'm livin' the good life, all right!
The ones to blame are the ones who buy this junk. They're the ones who think it's worth something.
The job site can be quite dangerous, but I have to keep working with my Pokémon.
I have trained my Pokémon well, and it's ready to go to the job site.
Ugh. I won't be able to make any money tomorrow with these injuries!
Welcome, welcome! Step right up! Step right up and battle a spell!
Only the winner! Yes, sir! Only the winner can celebrate!
Enough... That's enough...
I do menial work every single day. Am I just a cog in the machine?
I am well broken in. No snags slow down the smooth running of this machine!
I guess I'm happier than a person who cannot even be a cog in the machine.
Yo, kid! Are you new? I'm the Worker that everybody's always talking about.
If you don't know me, you're bogus! Good-bye! The Worker is heading out.
Kid! Remember me! I am the Worker everybody talks about!
There are no such things as brakes on MY skates!
I won't stop! Well, I can't stop! Hey, that's just the way I roll!
They've gotta be defective or something! Please! Someone! Anyone! STOP ME!
I started skating because I'd heard that girls liked guys who skate. It's not working at all.
Tell me the truth... Roller skating isn't even cool anymore, is it?
And I'm terrible at Pokémon battles, too! Now I'm never gonna get a girlfriend...
No matter how speedy the Pokémon is, I'll catch it on my super-speedy skates!
No Pokémon or Trainer can escape me on my speedy skates!
Man, I'm so speedy and smooth! I should be on "So You Think You Can Skate!"
Five seconds. You got that? I'm gonna wipe the floor with you in five seconds.
What? You say that was over five seconds?! Time moves differently in my world, OK?!
The moment that I hadn't beat you in five seconds, I'd already lost...to myself.
C'mon, pal. I'm just a newbie over here. You're gonna take it easy on me, right?
N-no! This is, uh...just a fluke! I really am a noob!
Whatever. That's, like, sooo amazing. You really showed me, huh? Really.
Ngh! Nosebleed! When I get too excited, my blood pressure goes through the roof!
I just can't stop these blasted nosebleeds! Every time I get excited or nervous... Argh!
Uhhh... It's not...stopping... I'm starting to feel...kinda...dizzy...
You're a rather delicate-looking little thing, hmm? Sure you're up for a battle?
See? What did I tell you? Are you ill or something?
Whoa-ho! Sorry for jumping to conclusions! Who'd have ever guessed you were strong!
Hey! You! Yeah, you! Let's work up a good sweat together, right?
Hey, don't sweat it... Sometimes you've just gotta learn to let it go.
You had me sweating bullets there! That's what being young is all about!
I didn't choose to be born a woman, OK? I didn't choose to grow up and be beautiful!
Hey, it's not like I chose for the battle to go this way, all right? Don't go blaming me.
Appearing, battling, then disappearing again... It's not like I was born just to play this bit part!
Breathe deeply of my perfume before you go. Get a whiff of a real Beauty's aroma!
Oh my, did you get too close? What are you, some kind of perfume fanatic?
The truth is that my "perfume" is nothing more than the scent of my cheap fabric softener.
The endless process of entropy... That is where nature's true beauty lies.
It is only right to be who and what you are. Do not fight it. Just leave yourself in fate's hands.
You don't understand? Well, neither do I. It's really just something I heard somewhere.
Ooh la la! Little Trainer! Graceful blossom! I'm going to snippety-snip you right at the stem!
La, la, oomph! Now where shall I start pruning, eh? Snippety-snip!
N-non! Not so fast! I mean you to be the prize bloom in my garden!
Watch out! You're on the menu next!
What a pushover you were! That was a piece of cake, my little cream puff!
Oh... I think I'll go back to the kitchen and have a nice slice of some humble pie...
Ready for the big game? Got your cap on straight?
My oh my! My Pokémon knocked it out of the park!
Hey, another out. So what? We'll come back! We always do!
Grip and rip, baby! I'm going to capture every moment of this trip for posterity!
Here, here! Take my camera, and get a shot of me looking awesome after beating you in battle!
I don't need any memory like this! Who wants to remember their failures? Delete!
Three-star restaurants? Shopping? Sightseeing? It's all so...so ANNOYING! I'm about to lose it!
Everything is about what SHE wants to do... Exactly what part of this is "our" honeymoon, huh?
You'd better remember this for your future, kid. Nothing ruins a honeymoon quite like a spouse!
Farewell, hearth and home and all I know! I shall become a Tourist!
Yes, a man must take at least one great journey! Even if my $1 flight ended up costing me $400...
I leave my beloved family behind in my hometown and set out upon my lonely journey of a lifetime!
An airplane that soars across the sky, leaving trails of jet stream behind it... That is how I fly!
Indeed! This is my moment of takeoff! I'm taking off from you! Eat my dust!
To think that I was grounded due to you... Ohhh! I'd better get a hotel voucher at least!
I can't tell my new husband now, of course, but the truth is that I used to be a Punk Girl!
Hiding any unpleasant details of my past... Ain't I just the picture of a perfect wife?
Ehhh, off with you! If you don't, I'm gonna make you listen to me gush about my husband all night!
I'm going to battle you with the Pokémon that my darling gave me as a symbol of our love!
A win for the love between me and my darling... It will burn forever!
Y-you defeated the symbol of our love... Does that mean that we're over already?
I have raised these very special Pokémon using a special method.
Pokémon will be strong or weak depending on how you raise them.
Ugh... It wasn't supposed to be like this. Did I administer the wrong blend?
Shall I share an exclusive tip for training great Pokémon?
You'll be perfect if you buy my book of Pokémon training tips.
You'll be fine if you buy my DVD of Pokémon training tips.
Pokémon are my family! See the solidarity of my family!
Well done, brothers and sisters! Our family solidarity is invincible!
NO! My...my family! What have you done?!
What you like doing and what you're good at doing aren't always the same.
I'm good at battling, but I don't enjoy it very much.
If you like what you do as a job, you have a sense of fulfillment, don't you?
Let me be brief. You cannot win against me.
You see, you cannot win, because you are very weak.
Hummmm... You are good. You are really pretty good.
Don't underestimate me because I am old. I'll show you my rejuvenating attack!
I'm old but still going strong! I can take care of myself!
What a cruel way to treat such a helpless old man! Shame on you!
I would like to retire soon...but I have no one to carry on the family business...
If I'd had a child like you, my golden years would have been carefree...
I wish my son were as mature as you are.
I feel sad whenever I see a bright, young child like you.
The first flush of youth... It is too bright for me...
Sparkling eyes, firm skin... I won't get them back.
Don't you think it's a bit too much? This kimono? But, well, I can only pull it off while I'm still young.
The kinds of fashion you can pull off have a pesky expiration date. We call it "age."
And, well, I suppose that when I'm older... This kind of getup will be too much hassle!
The story has it that this precious kimono was passed down within my family for generations...
Excuse me! Would you keep your distance! What if you got my precious kimono dirty?!
Look, truth is that "passed down for generations" thing is a joke. Who'd be caught dead in this?
Hey! It's me. It's me! The Owner of the world!
How's that? Owned, suckah!
Pffft! I wasn't seriously trying or nothing! Next time I'll show you some real ownage!
Watch out! I'm always ripped and raring to go! Show me a Pokémon that's beyond the beyond!
Take that! My Pokémon have never even heard of words like sedate!
Not yet! My Pokémon can still stand! It's not over! They can still stand!
My research will lead this world to peace and joy.
I am a genius. I will control the future of the world!
I am a genius... I am not supposed to lose against someone like you...
Only my research is left in my life. I abandoned my family and friends.
It's not bad to devote my whole life to research, is it?
Dedicating yourself completely to something can cause loneliness.
Mwahahahaha... Please lend me a hand for my experiment.
Mwahahaha... Yes, I did it! The experiment was a huge success.
Ho-hum. This is not good... The experiment was a failure...
You must face off against my super-powered-up Pokémon!
Well, it is only the natural outcome. The power of science is awesome.
Your Pokémon have a strength beyond the power of science.
If you lose, I'll have you help me with my latest experiment!
Mwahahaha! You lost! Now step right this way, Subject A...
Pah. I was sooo close to signing you up as my new test subject!
Why do people compete and fight? This is the subject of my research.
Even if you win, you will hurt your opponent's feelings.
If you lose, you may resent your opponent.
Hi! Focus!
Fooooo!
Eeeeek!
Speech can be utter nonsense. Pretty words only taint battles...
Trainers who treat battles as a sport are the height of vileness.
Defeat is worth nothing. Losers don't need words...
Heh-heh-heh. If you lose, I'll turn you into a Pokémon.
Heh-heh-heh. From today on, you are already a Pokémon!
Next time I see you, I will turn you into a Pokémon with my power.
I normally only ever listen to classical music, but if I lose, I think I shall try a bit of new age!
New age simply refers to twentieth century classical composers, right?
Is this the dawning of the age of Aquarius?
Heheh... I see it all clearly... You are a doctor from an evil planet, aren't you?
That was some kind of loss. Was there some sort of trap?!
Ugh... My powers... My powers are... I think I need a nurse...
You certainly look pleased with yourself. Just being near you makes me gloomy.
Now you've been dragged down, too. I think we could become friends now.
I hate the happiness of others... I'm just that sort of person, OK?
I praise your courage in challenging me! For I am the one with the strongest kick!
Haha... I probably did not have to use my strongest kick on you.
Oh. The Pokémon did the fighting. My strong kick didn't help a bit.
'Sup! I'll give it all I've got! Let's do our best!!
'Sup! That's enough, friend! You gotta value your life, yo!
'Sup! Good work. I tried everything I could, but I'm still pretty disappointed, yo!
Yo!
Yo! Yo! Yo!
Yo!
You don't have to try to impress me. You can lose against me.
Come. Sleep quietly in my arms...
It's hard to say good-bye, but we are running out of time...
Are you ready? I'm taking my gloves off.
Well, well... You're not even in my league. This is like bullying.
Aww... I cannot believe I lost! Who are you?!
I sure would like to do the fighting instead of my Pokémon, if I could.
Pokémon battles are not enough of a challenge. I want it to be personal!
Ah, I tingle with excitement. I sure would like to fight...
Halt at once! You there! Let us cross lances!
Trainer, you are at my mercy!
Trainer, I yield! Please spare me!
When I am surrounded by nature, most other things cease to matter.
I won the battle. But victory is nothing compared to the vastness of nature...
It doesn't matter to the vastness of nature whether I win or lose...
Despite my appearance, I was born a city boy. I yearned for country life.
Do you have a nice small hometown? If so, you should go back and visit there.
I don't have a small hometown to go back to, 'cause I was born and raised in the city.
It's my mission to protect nature and all the Pokémon living there!
If villains disturb the natural order, I will put them in jail!
Protect Mother Nature! Or I will put you in jail!
We need a lot of money to protect Mother Nature and her Pokémon.
Please donate money for a rich, healthy environment and for the sake of Pokémon.
We protect forests and Pokémon by gathering money and planting trees.
Let me stop your winning streak here.
Ah. You still have much to learn. Let me give you a crash course!
You didn't win alone. You couldn't have won without your Pokémon.
You seem quite confident. I'll sink you straightaway.
I am devoting my body and soul to Pokémon battles!
AAAH! I am sooo scared! I will never do it again... Sorry!
I'm working very hard, but that doesn't mean that I'm strong.
You're a strong Trainer, so I think I was just lucky this time.
What?! Even I can lose?! But I'm a battling genius!
I started battling just to be cool, but I became an Ace before I knew it.
People can become strong if they have clear goals. That's just the way it goes.
But I'm still not cool even though I've been recognized as an Ace...
The main character of this story... I'll tell you who it is!
The main character of the story is me! You are just an extra!
Of course, you are the main character!
We would like to hold a Pokémon battle against the strongest foe.
We cannot believe we spent time on such a childish battle! Leave at once!
Ho ho ho! That was to our liking! We find ourselves quite satisfied!
A person who wants to fight, fight, and fight forever. That's the way of the Ace.
However hard they battle, they won't be satisfied. That is a real Trainer, isn't it?
Your fighting style suits you very well. You could be an Ace Trainer.
I can see the despair in your eyes. Bring it on!
It was a waste of time, much as I suspected. You should consider starting over from zero.
Did I underestimate you? Or was it your true ability that let you win?
Hey, you, young Trainer. I'm utterly stylish, aren't I?
I'm so stylish, I hypnotize myself! You'd better keep your distance!
I'm a wreck. I'm adrift. It just kills me. It's so hard to be too stylish.
I won't lose against a kid like you who doesn't know anything about battles.
You really are an amateur. No sweat. (Whew... That was a little too close!)
What? This kid is a fast learner? Hahaha... I-I knew that, of course!
Ugh. Cough, cough! I don't feel so well. Please show a little kindness...
I lied when I said I didn't feel well! Veterans will do anything to win!
You're very sharp! You didn't fall for my fake sickness, huh?
Come. I will give you a taste of a Veteran's well-trained Pokémon.
How were the Veteran's Pokémon? Defeat tastes quite bitter, doesn't it?
You have served me a spicy defeat. And yet defeat is also part of life.
Oh, you are so cute! Come, I promise to be nice this battle.
You are just too, too cute. You are! I want to see you again. I'll be waiting!
Your battle is too cute, too! Let's play again sometime.
Oh? Aren't you a child? Who said you could come here?
You're not bad, but you're immature. Come back when you've learned a bit.
I thought you were a child. Hee hee... You are tough...
Don't you call me a Veteran! A woman is always young at heart!
I'm not finished with love or Pokémon! I'll stay fit and ready for both all my life!
I have pains in my eyes, my shoulder, and my back, but my heart is forever young.
I am the strongest Backpacker. I have lots of Pokémon in my Bag.
Hahaha! I am as big as my backpack, aren't I? Aren't I?
I have more Pokémon in my Bag! Oh... Wait... My Bag has a hole...
I'm not traveling in search of freedom.
You're carrying bulky luggage, but do you really need it all?
My Bag is like the sky... In other words, it is empty.
Oh bother! It's just SUCH a hassle the way that I am always winning with my Pokémon!
Oh! Bother and vexation! This is just too much! I can't stand how good it feels to win all the time!
Hey, can't you take a hint? I was trying to fake you out!
They say that the rich don't have to fight for anything, but I LOVE a good battle!
This buzz after battle is the best! It's like I just closed a big deal!
If you want to dream big, then you'll need to build up a whole lot of experience in battle!
Hey! Hey! Please check out my cute Pokémon!
How about that? I'm proud of my Pokémon.
Oh no, don't bother them like that! Please leave my Pokémon alone...
Being a Garçon is my disguise, and it helps me live a quiet life.
On my days off, the real me can appear! Yes, I am an Ace Trainer!
I'm struggling to make a living, so I've been in disguise a long time.
My Pokémon are the strongest. I don't think I will lose to you.
Did you think you could beat me with such wimpy Pokémon?
Ah... It's hard. It sure is frustrating to lose.
Don't you think a restaurant for Pokémon is a fun idea?
I wonder if people will order a full-course meal for Pokémon.
It's a restaurant for Pokémon, not a restaurant of Pokémon!
Harrumph! Harooo!
Harooo!
Harrumph!!
I am the great mountain range of your life! Overcome me if you can!
Hahaha! I am the summit, and the road to reach me is still very steep!
Finally, someone has climbed the mountain! This is my summit!
I'm gonna give you an experience so sweet that your eyes are gonna spin!
The dazzling romance of battle will make you grow into a real adult...
Phew... You are smoking hot! It's like a sweltering summer night in here!
The pretty-suited Pokémon soldier who sprinkles love on the world appears!
Take that, evildoer! I am the pretty soldier of "Prettiness and Pokémon"!
I can't be defeated yet... I still have to protect all that is pretty in the world...
Scary places are the best to me. I'd love to live in a cemetery...
Healing sites are nice, too, but they can't hold a candle to haunted sites!
In a cemetery where the party begins after the day ends. Yes, that's the life for me...
I may look like this now, but I was once a Beauty, too, you know!
I'm super popular with ghosts, but we have very ethereal relationships.
After I was dumped by my boyfriend, I fell into depression. Before I knew it, I looked like this!
I can really cut loose in Pokémon battles without getting scolded.
Nobody scolds me. That's why Pokémon battles are the best!
You like a big fight, don't ya? You're my new pal!
My 'net friends said I wouldn't be taken lightly with this look.
I won, but I was so scared... Maybe I'm not cut out for this.
Eek! I should've stayed in my room with my PC!
Sorry, pal. Nothing personal, but I'm abouts to go all kinds of crazy on your Pokémon!
My bad, my bad! Little too much for ya, huh? But there's no pullin' punches in a fight, amirite?
Arghhh! You little--! That HURTS. But, well, that's how it goes, yeah?
Yo. You ready to start this already? I ain't long in the way of patience.
Sucks, don't it? If you don't like that feeling, you better be ready to do anything to win!
That's fine by me! I like a strong partner! But you'd never take me in a bare-knuckle fight.
I'm about to serve you up a slice of battle so exquisite you'll think I'm the cream of the crop!
So? It was delicious, right?! Have some more then! MORE!
Stop right there! We haven't reached the final course yet!
Slobber... Oooh, a tasty-looking Trainer and Pokémon have wandered my way...
Yum-yummm, you all look delicious... Bagon appetite!
Mehehehe... Got away this time, did you? I'll definitely be Gulpin you down next time!
I used to get two minutes of sleep per day. Being a Butler was one hard job.
I don't know if they thought I was a Butler or a robot...
Change! It's time for a change! I couldn't take that kind of job a single day longer!
I'm tired of doing nothing but serving... So I think it's time for you to serve me!
Outstanding! From this day, you may call me "Master"!
No...wait... Don't run away... You're supposed to be my Butler...
If you lose, you can be my servant.
From now on, I am your employer.
I'll make you my servant someday.
Ahhhh... So strange. I feel very, very tired.
I still feel kind of blah. I'm all achy...
I really feel blah... I think I'll go home.
A child like you cannot understand the kind of beauty that I am pursuing.
I am a loyal servant to beauty. Ugly defeat does not suit me.
Perhaps the beauty I've been looking for...is you?
I paint pictures and live with Pokémon. I'm enjoying my life!
The sting of defeat will become a good memory when you grow older.
Experience hardships when you're still young. Old bodies just can't take them.
All right, then. I'll watch you. Let your passions run wild!
What? You're done already? No, I'll have none of that!
Heheheh... Are you sure? Don't you think you could keep going?
Heehee! If you wanna see some of my art, it's displayed all over the city!
Who needs a gallery, huh?! The streets are my art show!
The days that I spend dedicated to my art... That is the art of youth!
If you work diligently, you will get results.
You, keep trying. Master the basics.
Well, even if you work diligently, things don't always go as hoped.
I've arrived from a distant island. May I please trouble you for a battle?
I have won.
I was utterly inexperienced. I'd be grateful if I could be your pupil.
I am so obsessed with Pokémon, my wife is fit to burst with anger!
Pokémon battles are so much fun. There's no way I can quit!
I don't want to go home, 'cause my wife is as scary as a Legendary Pokémon.
Our lives have plenty of ordinary days...so I gotta have Pokémon!
Only Pokémon rescue me from boring and monotonous days.
When I look at a special person like you, I just melt.
The thrill and adrenaline has me racing! You look like you're almost standing still!
By putting yourself into a corner, you draw out your full potential!
Everything feels clearer when you get this excited! I can't stop this dangerous game!
I won't get mad if you beat me. It's just a game, after all!
Don't get mad over something like this. There are things in the world more worthy of anger.
It doesn't matter at all who wins or loses a game. The one who had fun is the real winner.
You have to cut down on resistance if you want to go as fast as you can!
I want to melt right into that blurry scenery that you can only see when going so fast.
Perhaps I could have gone even faster if you hadn't resisted me?
I'm the infamous "Cannon Girl" that all the town is raging about! I'll blast right into your heart!
I'm fast! I'm strong! I'm lovely! Nothing less for the Cannon Girl!
Blast!
Lemme tell you, I'm mighty strong. Don't come whining to me after I warned you.
Well, aren't you quite pathetic? This is what happens when you can select an opponent.
Hey, now, just a minute there! I haven't lost this thing yet!
Do not mistake the means for the goal. That is what my master once taught me.
The battle is just the means. Victory is always the goal.
For you to defeat me like this... What is the goal you strive for?
Oooh! I've spotted some handy prey! The hunt is about to begin... Game on!
C'mon, prey! You've gotta struggle a bit more, or it's not any fun for me!
Ohhh, a strong enemy! Is there a continue option somewhere?
My Pokémon are my pride and joy, so take your time and enjoy this battle with them.
Your Pokémon seem to be lacking a wee bit in the power department, friend.
Ahhh... That's a fine, good Pokémon you have. How would you fancy a wee trade?
"Harsh" and "bitter" are flavors in any good Chef's repertoire! Would you like a taste?
Your battling was bland, I'm afraid. What did you expect to happen when you're so unseasoned?
Yes, the harshness of that defeat... The bitterness on my tongue now... It's perfect!
I'm going to tell you something valuable: never expect much from a famous food!
You expect too much of something famous, and you just end up disappointed by reality.
"It's even better than I thought it would be!" If you can think that, you'll walk away happy.
All right then. Let's all be good little children and start our Pokémon lesson, shall we?
Oh my... It looks like you'll be repeating this lesson.
Oh my! You've passed with flying colors!
Hey... Can I ask you a question? When did you start loving your Pokémon?
I've always loved my Pokémon. I really thought that was true, but...
I guess it's more important to ask how long you'll keep loving them, though, isn't it?
Being called a Beauty doesn't excite me at all. It just seems like cheap flattery.
Certain types of people use sweet talk no matter what you look like. It's meaningless.
It's just plain creepy when someone uses compliments to win your attention. Ugh!
Come on, let's get on with it already! No need to worry about particulars!
Regrets from the past, worries about the future-- forget all that! All that matters is here and now!
Even if I try to forget, I can't remember... That's probably all I need to know, isn't it?
D'ya, uh, know where my little lady is? Seems like she's gone up and missing...
Someone like me winning something like a battle? City slickers sure are weak these days, ain't they?
My little lady's never been to a city like this'n. May've bitten off more'n we can chew. Uh-huh.
Don't these kind of guided tours make you feel like you're really not used to traveling?
Who was I kidding--going on a trip? At home, I just hide inside. By myself...
Why'd I bother screwing up my courage to come on a trip anyway? I should've just stayed home...
Ahhh! Blast! Where'd that useless husband of mine get off to now?!
Ditching his new bride like this... He...he can't possibly be getting cold feet now?!
You're even wilder than my new husband... Oh no, this is just...
Woo-hoo! My husband got food poisoning, so now I get to do whatever I want to do!
Ahhh... It's so fun and freeing... I guess I really am best suited to the single life...
Though the truth is that I just made him a TV dinner because I wanted some time alone!
I have made them too strong. They are beyond my control...
It's all over now... Nobody can stop them...
Finally, they calmed down... You've saved me. Thank you!
I will test the Pokémon you have been training.
Bah! Is that the best you can do? I expected more from you...
Wow! You're amazing! You've trained some great Pokémon!
Take a look at these Pokémon--I raised 'em myself. They make me right proud.
I am right proud of these Pokémon. They're my friends and my treasures.
You're a strong one, sure 'nough. But I don't plan to lose next time!
I am the top Breeder. I can tame any kind of Pokémon.
You see? My Pokémon are very loyal to me, aren't they?
They are too attached to me. They are not fit for battling.
Monsieur? What's there to be so sure about?! I'm sure I'll bring you down, that's for sure!
Argh! I hate being so sure all of the time! I don't want to be a Monsieur!
Arghh! You! You'll regret this! I will bring you down someday!
My brother told me once... "Eyes! Aim for the eyes!"
What my brother told me was right... Thanks, Bro...
I lost against a kid, Bro... I should've listened to you...
I can't drop my luxurious lifestyle just because I'm older. Nothing can stop it.
It may be a hard truth for a child to accept, but money does make the world go round.
I cannot drop the habits I learned when I was young.
I am a late bloomer and a crazy bloomer. I'll bloom and dazzle you!
Dance, blossom, and bloom! This woman flowers in triumph!
I want to fall while still in bloom, rather than dying on the branch.
In my country, we say that white can hide all manner of sins. Isn't it great?
But wait--doesn't that mean wearing white makes it clear you've got something to hide?
Oh, forget it! I'm done with fancy clothes! I'm ditching this outfit and going to get a tan!
I had no plans for the weekend, so I ended up wandering here before I knew what I was about.
The fact that you are so strong... It means you have too much free time, doesn't it?
Before I knew it, I'd been here for ages. But I'm not lonesome. Of...of course not.

Hi, how are you? I'm Nita! It's been a long time, Trainer! You haven't forgotten me, right? I might go mental if you say you did, with how I've been waiting! I know you're the only Trainer worth the challenge, and no guff! So let's get cracking on it!
Eh, that was a savage battle, all right! So what do you think of a serious Nita now? Quite the change? I hardly know myself! I know some folks think I'm a bit of a layabout, but I'm one to relish a real challenge. To battle a Trainer like you is one for the books! The Battle Maison and Nita will always be here and waiting for your visit, lovie! I'll even wet the tea, so come on by soon!
Wahey! That was such great fun! You really are a strong one, Trainer! It's been a long time since I've been defeated like that! So... I can hardly wait myself for the next battle between us, you bold thing! The Battle Maison and Nita will always be here and waiting for your visit! You'd better come again--and no guff!
Uh-um... Do...do you remember me? You don't...do you... Of course... I-I'm Evelyn... U-um... You really are a strong Trainer, aren't you, dear guest? Ah... I don't want to fight... You look too scary... I want to go home... O-oh! I'm so sorry!!! I know how fed up my sister would be if she heard me saying such things! L-let's just have the battle, shall we? I'll do my best! Honestly, I really will! You can fight with all you've got!
A-a-ahhhh no! A-are you all right?! Oh no... What do I do... I must have lost me mind... Ughhh... I'm s-so sorry... I promise I'll do it right next time... So please...please come challenge me to a Double Battle again...
Hah... Hah... You're so strong... And so scary... I can't take any more... Um... Dear guest... I'm s-so sorry... I...I tried as hard I could, but... I'm so knackered... I'll keep trying harder, so...please... You must challenge me to a Double Battle again...
Aye, in fairness, I knew a cracking Trainer like yourself would make it! So let's get straight to the battle! Both me and my Pokémon are delighted and excited about facing you again. Sure, and I don't need to be telling you, but... It'll be bad for me if that sister o' mine hears that I battled you without keeping up my wee act... So get your Pokémon out and let the battle begin! Here I come, ready or not!
Hehehe! What are you gawking at now? The savage mess you made o' the battle? Ha! I'm not havin' a dig at you--it's just great fun to battle hard after holdin' back! But I can tell you could be stronger yet! Come back when you've upped your game, eh? Oh, and one last thing, pet... Don't go tellin' me big sister that I battled you seriously, will you, lovey? Th-that sister of mine... When she tears into a person... Well, n-never mind. Just come back again, ye great lump! I'll be waiting!
Whisht! To think I'd lose again! And I wasn't holding back in the slightest! Don't I look a right fool now! What in the world are you, pet? But...hehehe... It was really good fun, wasn't it? I've been so bored battling lately, but now I feel proper satisfied... I'm going to keep getting stronger. Then I'll surely beat you! So until I do, you'd better not be losing!
If you're free for a time, come on by. ♪ If you're bored for a while, stop on in. ♪ Battle till you burst, oh, won't you try? ♪ For a good battle, the Battle Maison's just fine. ♪ You're a good 'un, guest. It's a pleasure to me that you keep coming to see us. My name is Morgan. Of the four Battle Chatelaine sisters, I'm the eldest. I've been counting the days till I might face you again. Let's get started with the battle at once, and mind yourself that you don't lose! I tell you, I may not be a tip-top Trainer... But I'll put everything into treating you to the most smashing battle you've ever had!
Thank you for the battle, love! It was a bit of fun, eh? By the by, here's something you might like. You can use communications to challenge the Battle Maison here with your Friends. So find a Friend and come to visit us again! I'll be taking me leave now, but I do look forward to your next visit, pet!
Just the outcome I would expect... Honestly, I'm not telling fibs! You really are the Trainer I thought you were, aren't you now, pet? Heh heh... Might I ask something? Would you consider working here? I think we'd be famous in a day if we had someone as good as you here. If we were as popular as all that... Oh, what a profit we would have! I'll even fix you a special outfit, so you will match us Battle Chatelaines! There would be a few contractual stipulations... For one, you'd need to live here at the Battle Maison for the rest of your life. Let's not talk about it anymore just now, but do consider the idea, won't you, pet? I shall wait eagerly for our next battle and for your favorable reply!
Hi, how are you! It's Nita's turn! Welcome to the Battle Maison! I'll be doing Multi Battles myself with my eldest sis, Morgan, today! Oh, but you two don't look all that fierce strong anyway, do you now. I don't doubt I could take you both on alone and do a handy job of it, too. Well, let's get cracking!
Nita: Th...thank goodness... Thank goodness I could win... If I lost to the two of ye now... My sister would've... She'd've... Aye, I would've had to leg it...
Nita: No, no, no! How could I-- This is terrible altogether! How could you do this to me, you wee, rotten Trainers?! Do ye not even know what Morgan'll do to me now?!
... ... ... Now, Nita? Did you honestly think I'd ever let you get away with saying such things? Our guests don't look strong, is it? You could beat them both, is it? You go throwing shapes like that, you had better be ready to leg it! And aren't I always warning you about the way you speak to guests? Is your head cut, girl! Have you not a shred of scruple in your body? If you lose now, you'll never hear the end of it!
Morgan: ... ... ... Well, Nita. Lucky for you, your opponent was having a rough day, so you were able to walk away the winner. I'll do you a favor this one time only. But you had better remember what I'm telling you. Understand? You're too old to be so bold. If you greet guests with that kind o' cheek, they might not ever return. Now, my dear guests... I hope you'll hear my apology and allow me to beg forgiveness for my sister's rude words to you. I hope you'll see fit to return to our Battle Maison.
Morgan: ... ... ... NITA! Oh, I'll do you, you little waster! First, you mouth off to our guests, with your boasting and insulting them so... And then you lose in battle despite it?! Do you even take this work seriously?! Could you ever face our dear ma and da, rest 'em, after such shocking behavior?! My dear guest... I am deeply sorry for this experience. I beg you will somehow overlook it and come visit our Battle Maison again. Now I must have a...discussion with my wee sister. You'll excuse us...
Welcome to the Battle Maison! My name is Dana. I am the second eldest of the four Battle Chatelaine sisters! Let me introduce my partner for this Multi Battle. Nita?
Dana: ... ... ... We have retained our victory. However, I must apologize to the both of you, I'm afraid. My sister Nita should not have attacked you like that without any warning. Such behavior reflects poorly on the dignity of the Battle Maison. Nita! Are you even listening? Apologize to them this instant!
Dana: Nita! We only lost the battle because you went and started it without waiting for me to be ready! The key to any Multi Battle is being in perfect sync with your partner! Can you not get that through your thick skull, you moppet?!
Eh, you and your innocent act, Dana! Forget the show! Let's just get on with it. Is this to be a battle or not, eh? I'm always up for a challenge, and I'm ready to start right now! There! You're wide open! I'll take you down!
Nita: Ah, yer sister! Why should I? They're the ones at fault for being wide open! I swear, Dana, you'll drive me crackers with your rules and manners. Pokémon battles should be fought as we like, and who's to tell us otherwise? As long as it's good fun for everyone, where's the harm? I'll stake my life that you secretly agree with me. And I'd suppose these two feel the same. That was a grand battle altogether, and I hope we can do it again sometime!
Nita: What's the situation, then? I don't see why I need to care about that sort of thing! All a battle has to be is cracking good fun! Besides that, my real specialty is Single Battle and has been since year dot! Who cares a fig about being in sync? As for you two, I hope I'll see each of you in a Single Battle sometime!
What kind of Pokémon will you be battling with? Hurry up and show me already, would you?
Well, I lost the battle, but at least I got to see some amazing Pokémon. That's fine by me!
I sure hope you'll bring a bit more impressive Pokémon along for our next battle, OK?
Whoa! What kind of luck is this? How did I get stuck battling someone so strong off the bat?!
Argh! I've lost! I couldn't do a thing against you!
I...won? Hah hah! Take that! I'm pretty good myself, huh?
My Pokémon are my friends! Take this! It's the power of our friendship!
My friends tried their best, but we were still no competition for you and your team!
Did you see that?! That's the power of our friendship all right!
I came here because I wanted to take part in a fiery Pokémon battle of passion!
That was exactly the kind of battle that I came here for! Thanks for showing me a good time!
Hmm. I really wanted to experience something more climactic than that. Guess that battle was a dud.
All right! Here I go! I'm going to battle you with the same old strategy I always use!
You have some amazing strategies yourself! I've learned a lot from this battle!
It went just as it always does! Hahaha! Looks like I win again!
I'd rather battle Pokémon than sleep! I'd even rather battle than eat! So come on already!
That's it! That's exactly the kind of battle I love! Yup, that's what battling you made me feel like.
Come on, pal! Do me a favor and bring some stronger Pokémon along next time, won't you?
You look like you could do some decent battling yourself! Hah, this is beginning to look promising!
That was a fantastic attack there! Let's battle one another again someday!
That was no poor show you gave! Come challenge me again someday, won't you?
Hahaha! Come battle against me, my Pokémon, and my blindingly beautiful smile!
Hmph... Well, your Pokémon was rather charming as well, wasn't it? Though not as much as me!
My charming Pokémon gave its all for that battle against you! And all for me!
Let's go all out, but fight fairly!
Thank you very much for battling me squarely!
It seems our side was just a little bit stronger.
Be shocked by the strength of my Pokémon! Tremble before us!
I was shocked by the strength of your Pokémon! I trembled before them!
You have learned the strength of my Pokémon! It's sunk right in!
I brought all kinds of Pokémon. ♪ Let's play a lot!
I lost--but thank you! It was so much fun!
I wanted to play more! It ended too soon!
My Pokémon are unbeatable! They won't lose!
Why?! My unbeatable Pokémon...
Amazing, aren't they? My unbeatable Pokémon!
I'll win the tournament with the Pokémon that I have worked so hard to get!
What? Why did this Pokémon lose?!
Yes! I knew it. This Pokémon really is the strongest!
If you get scared, it's OK to run. Don't push yourself. Just surrender!
Whoa! Please wait! You... You've got me.
Tee hee! I showed you the difference between your abilities and mine!
Hmm... I wonder what kind of strategy you're going to use.
I just couldn't read your attack at all...
Your strategies clearly need work!
I'll send you flying with my extraordinary attack!
Eek! You sent my Pokémon flying!
Hee hee! You won't beat me unless you train your Pokémon even harder!
My thought-out strategy is my biggest weapon!
What? You outsmarted me?! What a clever Trainer!
You fell for my tricks! This is how I battle!
Watch this! These are my best partner Pokémon!
Ha ha ha... There's always someone better...
Is that all you've got? You'll never be able to beat my partners like that!
My heart always races out of control before a Pokémon battle!
Thank you for making my heart pound so!
There's nothing that lifts my heart like the nice taste of victory!
I hope that my Pokémon battle with you will become a wonderful memory!
This bitter memory of defeat... I won't ever forget it!
This battle against you will be a memory that I'll treasure!
I'll show you what it takes to be a world champion!
If you've managed to beat me, then that makes you the strongest Trainer in the world!
Now do you understand what it means to be the strongest in the world?
How about I show you the strength that won at Worlds?
If you beat me, that means that you're strong enough to win at Worlds!
Now do you understand the strength you'd face if you went to Worlds?
Even a World Champion like me gets nervous before battles, you know!
What a strong opponent... This is what makes battling so much fun, though!
It looks like my careful battling strategies still won out in the end!
Even a World Champion like me gets nervous before battles, you know!
What a strong opponent... This is what makes battling so much fun, though!
It looks like my careful battling strategies still won out in the end!
Watch out! I'm going to show you what a runner-up at Worlds can do!
To beat me, the second strongest Trainer in the world...!
Did you think that being number two in the world would make me a pushover? Think again!
Watch out! I'm going to show you what a runner-up at Worlds can do!
To beat me, the second strongest Trainer in the world...!
Did you think that being number two in the world would make me a pushover? Think again!
I'll take you on in battle, even though I am the number two Trainer in the whole world!
So there are still even stronger Trainers out in the wide world!
Did you get to feel it? The power of a second-place winner at Worlds?
I'll take you on in battle, even though I am the number two Trainer in the whole world!
So, there are still even stronger Trainers out in the wide world!
Did you get to feel it? The power of a second-place winner at Worlds?
You want to battle with me, the third-place winner from the World Championships?
You've got the kind of strength that will take you wherever you want in the world!
That's right! I won't be defeated that easily!
You want to battle with me, the third-place winner from the World Championships?
You've got the kind of strength that will take you wherever you want in the world!
That's right! I won't be defeated that easily!
Haven't you ever thought that you'd like to know how strong a third-place winner at Worlds is?
To lose in a battle where I was being serious! You're strong enough to face the world's best!
It looks like I came out on top--not just in luck, but in real strength, too!
Haven't you ever thought that you'd like to know how strong a third-place winner at Worlds is?
To lose in a battle where I was being serious! You're strong enough to face the world's best!
It looks like I came out on top--not just in luck, but in real strength, too!
Watch out, you young fool! I'll be your opponent today!
Ho-how could I lose... Ooohhh! It's just so frustrating!
Gwa-ha-ha-ha! You're about 10 years early if you think you can take me on!
OK, here we go! Let's battle!
Wow, you're really amazing! You must really love your Pokémon, right?
Pretty pretty please! Give me that victory!
I don't want to lose anymore! Never, ever again!
What is this?! Ahhhhh! I'm sorry, my Pokémon!
I'm over the moon!!!
This is a team made for winning! They say that honest effort will never betray you!
What... Is this for real?
I'm the one who's beaten everyone in the nation!
I don't really know what you want from me, but I just have to battle a bit, right?
There's, like, no way I could have won against such a strong opponent. That's crazy.
Huh? I won? What did I do? What happened? I don't get it. Can you explain?
I'm always serious and ready to go! I'm going to go all out again today!
WHAT?! Are you serious?! I stayed up all night thinking of that strategy!
See! Everything went just as I expected it to! My calculations were flawless!
C'mon! C'mon! Faster! Let's go! My Pokémon are chomping at the bit!
What a world! You're amazing! Be my friend, why don't you?!
I get to fight everyone in the world! I love it! This is what living's for, pal!
The word that can unite people around the world... That word is "Pokémon"!
Battles all come down to the luck of a moment! You're amazing for having that luck on your side!
You've got to smile whether you win or lose! That's what it means to be with "Pokémon"!
It doesn't matter who your opponent is. All you need is the appropriate method, and you will win.
Even with the ideal method, I could not win... Your team is nothing short of amazing.
In any pursuit in life, you must fix your eyes on your desired outcome and proceed accordingly.
Aha! Even half-hearted moves are enough to befuddle an opponent!
Aha! A truly strong opponent will not be led astray by such moves!
Aha! You seem to have confused yourself in your effort to befuddle your opponent.
These competitions are like a wild party, right? You never know what will come at you!
Your battling style is not bad! Your Pokémon seemed to have fun, too!
I was just having a good time, but I accidentally went and won. Sorry about that!
What I want is the glory of victory! I'm going wrest it away with all my might!
I'm frustrated with all my might! I'm not going to forget you!
It was what I wanted with all my might! That's why I could seize victory for myself!
I only use the coolest moves! 'Cause I want to win while looking cool!
I guess that just plain winning is cooler than even the coolest moves...
Any moves will look cool when we're the ones using them! Hah!
Every meeting in life is precious, every encounter to be cherished. Let's make our Pokémon happy!
I must use this defeat as fuel for my improvement and grow stronger. Let's meet again!
Win or lose, each battle is a unique experience that only comes once in life. I'm glad we got to battle.
