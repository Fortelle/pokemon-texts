Best of Sinnoh TV I was just your average girl until I was struck by a Thunder Shock. It was love at first sight, baby! And my target, a Gym Leader! I didn't have any Pokémon then, but not a problem for a resourceful gal! The answer was simple--and we all know simple is best! I just had to become a Trainer. That's all it took for me! "The Diary of a Poké Romantic" will soon make its debut! The pilot episode: "Love at First Sight: The Rules of the Move Attract!" By the way, how did everyone get their first Pokémon anyway? ...
Best of Sinnoh TV After some fits and starts, a childhood friend gave me my first Pokémon! ...It was a Kricketot. Except...I don't like the legs of bugs. I bet he gave me this because I picked on him when he was little... But though the road has been long and hard, I'm finally at the starting line! Next week: "The Diary of a Poké Romantic," episode two! "The Maiden in Love and the Kricketot: The Magic of Romance Never Ends!" Oh, this Kricketot is a female. Maybe we can be friends. ...
Best of Sinnoh TV I checked out my Kricketot and learned about its moves. ...It only knows Growl and Bide. That's worse than just challenging! I was about to say that, when my childhood friend stopped me. "Let it hold an Oran Berry so that it can survive while using Bide." Hey, that's smart! That's from a former Bug Catcher! While we're at it, may I have an Oran Berry, too? Next week: "The Diary of a Poké Romantic," episode three! "Love Conquers All: Covering Weakness with Ideas!" We're a Trainer and Pokémon now! We'll get stronger together! ...
Best of Sinnoh TV I had my first ever Pokémon battle, and it ended badly... My childhood friend, a former Bug Catcher, had this to say... "Pokémon get tougher by battling. The key to victory is type matchups." Type matchups? Types affect battles? The only type matchup I care about is with that Gym Leader! Next week: "The Diary of a Poké Romantic," episode four! "Type Matchups Settle Battles! Moves That Exploit Weak Points!" Fire, Flying, and Rock... Kricketot has some disadvantages! ...
Best of Sinnoh TV We'd win a battle, and lose one. Lose one, then win one. Though it was at times discouraging, I had to keep battling to toughen us up. With me and Kricketot, it was always three steps forward, two steps back. But we were getting stronger. Then, one day, Kricketot started to shine! Next week: "The Diary of a Poké Romantic," episode five! "Kricketot Becomes Kricketune! Watch Me! I'll Change, Too!" And to cancel Evolution, press the B Button... Tell me that first! ...
Best of Sinnoh TV After Kricketot evolved, it became stronger as Kricketune. We also got other Pokémon, so we could go farther and farther from home. But where is my beloved Gym Leader? Where is that city he said he's from? I do have the Town Map, but maps baffle me. It doesn't matter, though. If we keep moving, we'll get somewhere. Next week: "The Diary of a Poké Romantic," episode six! "How Is This Possible? Pokémon Gyms Can't Be Found Everywhere!" The more lost you are, the less useful a map becomes! You know it's true! ...
Best of Sinnoh TV Our journey was long, and it was hard. But no one wants to hear that! So, I finally found my Gym Leader. But he has an incurable disease! He begged me, out of the blue, with his last wish. He asked for my Pokémon! But my Kricketune's my partner! Next week: "The Diary of a Poké Romantic," episode seven! "My Trail of Footprints Shortened the Distance Between Us!" Every time I see Kricketune's face, I am reminded of our time together... ...
Best of Sinnoh TV My beloved Gym Leader, whom I fought so hard to meet, was a fraud! How dare he con this pure maiden! How dare he toy with my emotions! But whose fault was it? Was it mine for being taken in? All I know is that my tears overflow, and despair is my world... Next week: "The Diary of a Poké Romantic," episode eight! "Kricketune and I! Our Bond Is True!" That Gym Leader's eating a Giga Impact for playing me for a fool! ...
Best of Sinnoh TV Having defeated the fake Gym Leader, Kricketune and I stood in a daze. We were spent. Drained by a romance that ended in a nightmare. It was then that my childhood friend, the former Bug Catcher, arrived. He did more than that. He confessed his love to me! "I wanted to become an Elite Four member, so I quit as a Gym Leader. But then that faker appeared. You took care of him, though!" Wait, ex-Bug Catcher! What? What are you saying?! Next week: "The Diary of a Poké Romantic," final episode! "Do it, Kricketune! Silver Wind over Sinnoh Skies!" You were laughing at me for falling for that fraud, weren't you? ...
