Welcome to the world of Pokémon!
I am Augustine Sycamore, the Kalos region's very own Pokémon Professor.
This world of ours is widely inhabited by creatures known as Pokémon!
These mysterious creatures can be found in every corner of our world...
Some run across the plains, others fly through the skies, and others yet swim deep in the oceans...
We live together with these Pokémon, lending our strength to one another to live and prosper.
Let's get started with some quick questions... Are you a boy? Or are you a girl?
And what do you look like?
Oho, I see. Would you tell me your name?
So it's <var>, then? Did I get that right?
So it's <var>, then? Did I get that right?

Go and meet many Pokémon and people, and fill your life with rich experiences!
Now let's go visit the world of Pokémon!
