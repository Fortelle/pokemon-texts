Ah...
What's wrong?

Who are you?
H-help...

Never mind me...
You have to help it! Please!
Save Nebby!
Pe-e-ew...
Those Spearow are attacking it! But...I'm not a Trainer. I can't...
Please! Please save Nebby!

I'll heal your Pok√©mon for you, so...

You managed to chase off one of the Spearow, but...oh, but there are still more!
Please...please help Nebby if you can! But be careful... It looks like that attack may have damaged the Plank Bridge, too...
