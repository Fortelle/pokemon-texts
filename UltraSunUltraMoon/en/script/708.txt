Eek! You are, aren't you?! You're the famous star Chuuster!
Chu?!
You've become a household name with the massive success of your latest film, Chuuster! So the rumors that you were here in Alola were true after all! How are you spending your time off? What brought you here to Alola, now?
I must ask that you respect Master Chuuster's privacy and let him vacation in peace. He will not be taking interviews at this time.
What! But everyone is just dying to know more about the famous Chuuster's private life! You've got to spill!
Please, miss. We've already asked once nicely...
Shoo...
Step in
Walk away
You want an interview, too? This is my scoop! I'm not letting you have it!
Waaaaaah! B-but the freedom of the pressâ€”!
Thank you for helping us out of that rather sticky situation.
Chu.
Oh! It seems Master Chuuster is also most appreciative of your assistance!
Chu.
What?! Are you sure, sir?! I-if you insist...
This is from Master Chuuster, for you.
Please use it wisely.
Chu-chu-chu... Chuuu!
Oh! That's it! The Pikanium Z pose!!!
Lovely, sir! Oh, it's just exquisite!
Chu!
