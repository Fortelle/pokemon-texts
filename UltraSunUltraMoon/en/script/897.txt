You've got to eat up to grow strong, right? So if I just keep making enough delicious food, everyone will eat it and get stronger!
I eat until I'm fit to burst, then get a bit of a workout in with some Pokémon battles! But I guess my Pokémon are the ones working... Is that why they're the only ones staying slim?
It's OK to get sick of doing something. It's just a chance to try something new! But I never ever get sick of the lineup they have here at this restaurant!
Munch nunch...
It's a painting that sets your imagination on fire, but some people wouldn't understand it. The signature on the bottom reads "Mina."
The blackboard has the day's special written on it. Apparently everything is up to the cook's whim today!
Alola is home to lots of new dishes, since the foods of so many different cultures and regions all get mixed together here. That's great! And I love copying great things! Just like I copy an opponent's best moves!
People talk about food for Pokémon, but I don't know what they mean. When people and Pokémon eat the same thing and have the same smile on their face when they're done, I think that's the best!
