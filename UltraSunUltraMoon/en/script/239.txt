Nice work, Captain! You helped <var> here through hiser trial, and your experiment was a success!
It seems that your Ping Totem Pokémon 2.0 uses too much electricity. If we can get a little assistance from Charjabug, we should be able to make some improvements.
Here, <var>. I'll give you this Electrium Z to reward you for beating the Totem Pokémon.
You watching?
I was fine when the power was off. Geez... Now that you can see me, I feel all nervous... I'm not sure what to say. Thanks? Or, uh, congratulations? You passed my trial.
That is all.
You really are a fine Trainer, <var>!
