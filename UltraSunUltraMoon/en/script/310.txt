Ah, <var>. It's been a while since we last saw you...
Wha—?!
Y...you came? You actually came to help me, <var>? Thank you... Thank you!
Hmm. So you know one another?
A gifted young Trainer like <var>... And she bothers with someone like you?
How disappointing.
I don't need your approval, Mother! Or your permission! I will save Cosmog!
My... You do say such incomprehensible things.
Calling me mother? I don't have any children! Certainly not any wretched children who would run off and reject my love!
So tell me how you'll save that Pokémon. What can you do, Lillie? You failed to convince me to listen to you. You don't even have the strength of a Trainer. The only thing that you've ever done on your own is steal someone else's research material!
It's so terribly unattractive. But know that my fathomless love will save even someone like you... when I protect this entire world from darkness!
Protect this world...? Mother! What is it you're trying to do?!
Is that why you want Nebby? Is that what you would sacrifice Cosmog for?
That's right... I will force Cosmog to use its power, and it may very well die. But if it will save the world for all of my beloved Pokémon, then that is what I will do.
Lillie. I will be using the Cosmog you stole for a great purpose. You have kept it safe until now, and for that... I thank you.
Mother!
<var>... I really am happy that you came after me... But...but I...
I want to save Nebby, but I don't know what I should really do!
