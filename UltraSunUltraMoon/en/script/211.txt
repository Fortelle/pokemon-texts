<var>? You and Hau are both trial-goers, aren't you? Are you hoping to become champions? I suppose... You must be around 11, then?
Yeah, I am
How'd you know?

How...how lovely for you. I suppose all children must yearn to take a journey of their own choosing when they get to be about your age. Though you're hardly just children anymore. Trainers are like parents to their Pokémon!
<var>. Hau. Would you two like to see the conservation area upstairs?
Here's the button... Let's push it!
