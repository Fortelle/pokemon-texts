What you have just received is the Normal Z-Crystal!
It is known as Normalium Z!

Now if you let a Pokémon that can use a Normal-type move hold that...
and strike an elegant pose like this one... then you will be able to strengthen a Normal-type move by unleashing Z-Power!
Moving right along...
Ah, yes. First, there is one thing I forgot to mention.
The Totem Pokémon!
In every locale where a captain holds his or her trials, you will encounter a particularly strong Pokémon, like <var> just now.
And during battles against such Pokémon, they may summon allies to shore up their offense. It's not a tactic often seen in other regions. Perhaps Pokémon in Alola are simply more inclined to help one another?
Since you have managed to defeat the Totem Pokémon and proved yourself, you can now try to catch any of the Pokémon you find here in this cave. In fact, have some Great Balls.
And here, let me see to your Pokémon after all of their hard work in there!
If we're done here, I have something interesting I'd like to show you. Come with me to Route 3.
