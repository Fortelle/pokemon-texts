Wait up! Me and <var> have a favor to ask.
Be our opponents in our first ever Pokémon battle together!
Yeah!
No!
Hold on! Before you two step into the ring, let's make sure little <var> is up to it!
Then I'm gonna wait for you, so you better come back and battle me!
All right! I'm seriously gonna enjoy this!
Whoa! That was awesome, <var>! You and <var> were both so cool!
You've gotta have the kinda battles where everyone has fun. You and your partner Pokémon, too, you know?
Right on, <var>! You and Hau both brought out the best in your partners and pulled off some spectacular moves, yeah!
Iki Town is right up those stairs. Come on, <var>!

You should totally check out Iki Town!
It's a Trainer's job to draw out the max power she can in hiser partner Pokémon, yeah!
