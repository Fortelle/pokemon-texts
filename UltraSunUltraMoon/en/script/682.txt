Hey, hey, did you know? There's a secret about the flowers in the water bowl!
I'm interested!
Not interested
If you ever want to find out the secret of the flowers, I'll be happy to tell you!
If you're curious about the secret of the flowers, come back in the morning!
You see, the flowers...
Kyuuuuuuuuumf!
Comfey floated some flowers on the water...
As you saw, they belong to Comfey! They have a healing effect, so they're great to have in a Pokémon Center!
It always brings flowers in the morning, to help heal everyone who comes here!
Thanks!
That's great!
Kyuuuuuuuuumf!
Oh! Come on, Comfey! Just because your Ability is Triage doesn't mean you can go ahead and heal other people's Pokémon! That's my job!
Kyumf...
The Ability Triage gives priority to your Pokémon's healing moves!
Comfey is so caring, it uses Floral Healing the moment any Pokémon are near, just in case!
