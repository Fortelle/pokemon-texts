You're <var>? Thank you for helping out our Mallow. Oh. I know! Here. Take this for stopping by. I already used it for making stock, but that shouldn't stop your Pokémon from enjoying it.
It's good to give Dragon-type Pokémon a Dragon Fang to hold on to. Though we cooks tend to use them for rather different purposes, as you can see!
I hope you and Mallow will stay friends!
