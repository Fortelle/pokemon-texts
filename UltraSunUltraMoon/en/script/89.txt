Hey, miss. Is it true that you can get some kinda special gift if you have a Rotom Dex?
My goodness, you get the news fast! Hardly anyone has a Rotom Dex, but it is true that we have a special item to go with it. It's our very own Poké Finder! Here you go!
Awesome!
Isn't that awesome, <var>? You got a Poké Finder!
So, like, what's a Poké Finder?
The Poké Finder is a tool that lets you take photos of Pokémon. Rotom will help point out places where you'll be able to take photos, too. Here, I'll read you the instruction manual. "Tap on Rotom or press [0xE005]." Yup, that's all it says. Quite simple, isn't it?
Man, that Rotom Dex is cool! It's like a whole nother partner, <var>! I mean, on top of your Pokémon partner!
Oh, but I guess since it's Rotom inside... it pretty much is a Pokémon partner? Either way, you're pretty darn lucky. Meet you outside when you're done in here!
The photos you can snap of Pokémon with a Poké Finder... They are simply too cute to resist!
