Look! There it is...
Ah... I'm sorry. What was your name? ... ... ... Of course! <var>! It is a lovely name. Just lovely.
Now look over there. Do you see that?
Whatever is kicking up such lovely splashes must be rather big... A strapping young Swimmer, perhaps? Or an amazing Pok√©mon specimen?
Are you going somewhere? I would still like you to investigate those splashes in the water.
