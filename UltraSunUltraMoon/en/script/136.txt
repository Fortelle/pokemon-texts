Hey, Prof, are you sure this old thing's really seaworthy?
Hey now! Don't you go calling my boat old! She's not old... Call her a classic. Well seasoned, yeah?
I quite like that it has a sense of history...
Pew!
Hey, <var>! If you're all done with catching Pok√©mon and shopping, yeah, you wanna head out with us?
It's good to try new things. I'm sure Mantine Surf will be another wild new experience for you! That's what the island challenge is all about!
No sweat, <var>. Finish up whatever you want to do on Melemele. Though you can always come back anytime!
I heard that every island has different-flavored malasada! Man, I can't wait to try 'em all!
The next island... It's too far away to see with the naked eye.
