What is it, <var>? Do you need to leave so that you might prepare yourself better for my trial?
I understand. It's unfortunate, of course, but go prepare yourself so you can come try again.
Defeat the totem to prove your skill to me. And...well, you may find that using Grass- or Electric-type moves will be to your advantage. Or you could always resort to using an X Sp. Def or two, or perhaps a Dire Hit. Do not let your guard down. The totem is not to be trifled with.
Then, please go ahead and drive those frisky Pok√©mon downstream to call out the totem!
So, <var>... You bowed out of the trial of Lana.
