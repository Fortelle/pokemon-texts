Hey, who are you?! Nobody should be able to enter Team Rocket's Castle!
I-I have admin rights...
What?! How dare you try to confuse me with your nerdy language!
...*ahem* No matter!
Team Rocket's Castle is under our control! There's nothing you can do, whoever you are!
Ahahahahahahah! Muahahahahahahahaha!
It seems like this group calls itself Team Rocket. They definitely don't seem like nice people... I can't believe I've allowed Festival Plaza to be taken over by people like them...
Still... He said this castle was under their control. What exactly did he mean...? Give me a sec and I'll check...
I've got it, <var>... They have some sort of program lock that prevents us from using the Pokémon in our party!
We need to figure out some way to get Team Rocket out of here, but without using our own Pokémon...
