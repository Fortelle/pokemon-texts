<var>!
Phew, that Togedemaru was strong! But I managed to get through the trial, too. Maybe even managed to get a bit stronger, eh?
I heard from Sophocles how you just breezed through that trial yourself, <var>. You're something else! I know! You should take this!
You only have one volume, don't you? Haven't you ever heard the expression that silence is golden?
Gah! He's back!
Listen, Team Skull is looking for a Pokémon called Cosmog... Do you two know anything?
What?! N-not that we'd tell you!
So you do know something. Look... Cosmog isn't even a strong Pokémon. But it has the potential to summon Pokémon so terrifyingly strong that you don't even know. If something like that happened, it would be a disaster for Alola...
A disaster? Like...a real disaster? Then what're we supposed to do about it?
Protect it! If you do know where Cosmog is or if you do find anything out...just keep it safe! I know I might be working for Team Skull right now, so you may not trust me or care but... I'm going to tell you this just once. You have to protect Cosmog... no matter what!
I still don't even understand how Team Skull found out about Cosmog in the first place...
What do you mean? No matter what? You just gonna leave us hanging?!
<var>... If they're really looking for Cosmog, then... Is Lillie gonna be OK?
I don't really get what's going on, but we've just got to keep both of them safe, right?! Then I know what I'm gonna do. Take on the next trials to train with my partner!
Look, I know Guzma was saying all those things, but I really wanna complete my island challenge and help people learn about Pokémon battling! And, I dunno, I've gotta make sure I really get what my partner's feeling, too!
