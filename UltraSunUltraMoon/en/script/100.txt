We're right by the sea! That's right! Welcome to my wonderful seaside motel!
My Crabrawler sure is something, ain't he? He nabs passersby to bring them to me, so I can send them down by the bay!

Though he's actually been a little too good at his job, so I've got no vacant rooms to offer you. But that doesn't mean you've come for nothing!
Here, follow me this way.
See that! Look at that broad expanse of beach! Its name is Big Wave Beach. There are some interesting Pok√©mon to be found down on the beach, so I'd suggest having a look.
And, just so you know, the path to the beach was made by none other than yours truly. That's right, just me and my Crabrawler!
