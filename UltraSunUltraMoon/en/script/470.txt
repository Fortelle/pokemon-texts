You're getting close to your goal... I imagine you must've come here to attempt the trial, huh?
So... Uh...
Where are the Charjabug?
Um, Molayne said...
I guess it's their dinnertime?
Oh... They're eating... Right.
The Charjabug are real gluttons, you know.
The Charjabug help me out with my trial, so can you go get them all for me?
I'll have to get everything else ready while you do that...
I'm gonna have to get Togedemaru's help, too. This'll be my first time testing it...
S-so it would be a huge help if you would go call all the Charjabug for me!
