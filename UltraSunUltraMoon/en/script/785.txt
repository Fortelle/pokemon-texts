The lineup of clothes you can buy at apparel shops is different for each shop, you know? I wonder what kinds of clothes you can buy on the next island?

If you want to change your contacts or your outfit or anything, you can use the fitting room. It's the little room with that nice, big mirror!
If you're not sure how to pull an outfit together, you're always safe with picking things from the same color family and putting them together.
