So you will truly go?
Our Ultra Megalopolis was once a world filled with light... Necrozma was called the Blinding One, and it gave us all the energy we needed.
And in fact, we were not the only ones who basked in its light. It traveled even to the distant world of Alola by passing through the Ultra Wormholes!
But...our ancestors grew too greedy, and they caused Necrozma to lose a part of its body. And this in turn made Necrozma run wild... Help it if you can. We beg you...
Be careful, people of Alola... Necrozma is really strong.
There's nothing that we here can do... We can no longer control it with our technology, and we certainly have no hope of defeating it in battle ourselves...
The light of Necrozma once filled our world. And it did not shine upon us alone. It gave energy to many, throughout Ultra Space.
Yeah, Necrozma is amazing! That's why...if you could just help it calm down... I bet it would share its light with everybody again, like it used to. Please... You've got to help it!
