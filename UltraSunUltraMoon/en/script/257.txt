Woo, <var>!
Those were some nice moves! I can feel my soul shaking!
Oh yeah! I almost forgot to give you something super important! Here you go, cousin. This is the Z-Crystal for <var>... The Evolution of the <var> you chose!
And, uh, about that mask you've got there, <var>... Molayne gave you that, yeah? I'll take it, if you don't mind. I can make sure it gets back to the Masked Royal safe and sound...
You handed the mask to the professor!
You saw that, too, yeah, Hau?
Uh, yeah, I did! That was an awesome battle, <var>!
Maybe someday Guzma'll figure out what it is you kids learn on the island challenge.
So what happened to Lillie? You guys lose her somewhere?
I'm right here.
And so is Acerola!

You and the professor fought those horrible Team Skull thugs, <var>? Just thinking about it makes me worry... They sound like a scary group...
You think? I don't know. Exchanging a few moves in battle is the quickest way to get to know someone in my book.
Well, I'm going to head up Mount Lanakila. I've gotta make sure the Pokémon League gets finished and everybody has the chance to find their own perfect move! Keep training hard on your island challenge. One day the two of you'll make it there, too!
<var>, Hau... be sure you're not pushing yourself too hard.
<var>! You made it through Sophocles's trial, huh? That's really great! You can take on the next trial up past Route 11. Through Tapu Village, you know? If you get lost on your way, ask a police officer for directions. They're here to serve, right?
Now, Lillie, you're coming with me to do some shopping!
You remember what my gramps told us? He said we'd meet Pokémon and people on our journey that'd enrich our lives, yeah? I mean...I'm having a good time on my journey, for sure, but...maybe that's not enough?
