We are members of the Aether Foundation. We work to carry out conservation efforts and care for Pokémon that have been hurt by bad people, like those Team Skull thugs.
Slowpoke's tail has fully regrown now... But Pokémon should be like family! Team Skull can't get away with crimes like this!
Those Team Skull scoundrels! Even if Slowpoke tails are delicious, you can't go ripping them off like they're yours to take! Even though Slowpoke are so sluggish that it takes them five seconds to feel pain when they're struck!
Lo-o-ow...
