So, <var>, I'm leaving this Rotom Dex in your hands! Rotom, you look after <var>, yeah?
So that's the Rotom Dex, eh? It's kinda cute.












All right then, <var>! You too, Hau! Get a move on!
OK!
What?
To the Trainers' School!
You've gotta learn the basics of being a Pokémon Trainer through Pokémon battling. It's a long road to becoming the island challenge champion, and the Trainers' School is the first step!
What about you, Hau?
I'm good. I just wanna play with my Pokémon!
The island challenge... So this is how the people of Alola connect with the world around them.
And then there's the way that you and <var> both chose one another. And now with Rotom helping you out as well... Even Nebby likes you! I guess there's something about you that makes Pokémon feel comfortable when they're by your side.
Lillie! You take care of <var>, yeah? Until she gets used to Rotom, help himer find hiser way around!
