... Brrrrrr!
You feel strong cold air coming from the stairs you just climbed. Go down there and check on it.
Several pieces of paper are pinned to the bulletin board. One piece of paper has black stains on it.　・ ・　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　・　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　・
The cold air flowing from the stairs has calmed down a bit.
You may have done something wrong... The cold air has gotten stronger.
You barely feel the cold air from the stairs anymore. You may be able to go downstairs now.
*smack*
Did something cold hit the back of your neck? ... ... ... ... ... ...
The cold thing suddenly attacked you!
The cold air is totally gone!
Some mysterious force pushed you out of the school!
The door is locked.
