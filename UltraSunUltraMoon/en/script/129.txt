Congratulations, <var>. Your performance has been a delight ever since I first laid eyes on you at the Trainers' School.
Aren't Z-Powers lovely?
I'm amazed that you won without even using your Z-Power.
Oh, I know! Why not stop by the Alola Photo Club for a commemorative photo? With Tauros, you can be down to Hau'oli City in no time at all.
Very well then, off on your island challenge you go! May the future bring you happiness!
