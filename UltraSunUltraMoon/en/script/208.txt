Here we are, you two. This is Aether Paradise.
Aether Paradise is a facility created for the conservation of Pokémon. It has been outfitted with all of the latest technology for this purpose.
Downstairs, our teams work on developing new Poké Balls and more. Yes, all for the sake of Pokémon conservation.
Though you will not be able to use any of your Poké Balls within Aether Paradise. A jamming signal is broadcast throughout the facility to prevent them from functioning.
