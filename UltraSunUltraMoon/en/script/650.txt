A trial-goer, are you? You must believe in your partners then. In that case, I'll be waiting. Yes, waiting for you to overcome your trial... and waiting for the rain to fall once more...
I am waiting for the rain... The rain that will wash everything away.
This is a fine rain... It will wash everything away... including our painful defeat in battle! What do you say? Do you think you can handle a little skirmish against my Pokémon?
Sure I can
I'll take a rain check
The pain he left behind when he disappeared... That's what this rain really is...
Good! My team is perfectly tailored for the rain, and they are about to be unleashed upon you!
The power I hoped to gain from the rain... It looks like it didn't work on you, did it?
I had this friend. This crazy, great friend. And his name was Johnny, too. He would use the move Rain Dance all the time, and he could beat absolutely anyone with it.
But then...he fell in love. He fell for this right spark whose Pokémon used Sunny Day... And that was the last anyone ever saw of good old Johnny...
The team I battle with now are the Pokémon he left behind when he up and disappeared. And every time the rain falls, these poor little blighters remember old Johnny...
Rainy days are the best... No one can see your tears in the rain.
