I, Faba, am the Aether Branch Chief. The only one in the world, I'm irreplaceable.
And here you come back...uninvited?
Like you don't know why. You of all people should know everything that happens in the Aether Foundation. Isn't that right, high-and-mighty Branch Chief?
Hee hee hee! Look at you... Living out in the world hasn't been kind, has it? But I'm still not telling you anything! And you of all people should understand why... Gladion.
Hey, <var>.
You know why being a Trainer is so great? Because when you're battling, it doesn't matter if you're a kid or an adult. Everyone's equal in Pok√©mon battle!
Oh ho... Is that right? Is that what you think?
So you wish to battle me? Branch Chief Faba? The man who is called Aether Paradise's last line of defense is to battle a mere child?!
As you will!
H-h-how can this be?! How could this child...
Aue, look at you, <var>! And Faba is real strong, too!
So... As I said, Faba. You of all people know what I'm here for.
Indeed... The world truly hasn't been kind to you, has it? Look how hard it has made you. If you're looking for Cosmog, I suppose it might be downstairs.
Downstairs?! Oh yeah! Ms. Wicke did say there was another level farther down, didn't she... What do you do down there?!
Experiments to reach a world different from Alola... That's what I've been told, yes.
We're in a bit of a hurry, Faba. A lift would be nice.
Why not? This is an act of kindness I can do for you thanks to my position as branch chief.
<var>. Hau. If you're ready, let's head down.
Are you ready?
...All right. Let's go.
...Don't make me wait too long.
Man, I'm like...stunned by so much of this...
...You should descend, promptly. I am being kind. Can't you see that?
