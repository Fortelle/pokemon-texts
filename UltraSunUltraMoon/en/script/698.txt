Grrr...
This is Tigrudo, the pro wrestler Incineroar! He's been in a slump lately, though... Wanna hear about it?
Until recently, Tigrudo here was undefeated. The place was always jam-packed to the rafters for his matches!
But now he's been losing to an up-and-coming pro wrestler, Machamp. It looks like Tigrudo is starting to lose his mojo.
Mraow...
If only he had the TM for Acrobatics, maybe he'd stand a chance against the Fighting-type Machamp.
Would you look at that? You've got the TM for Acrobatics right there, don't you?!
You can use a TM as many times as you want, so would you use it on Tigrudo?
Sure
I'd prefer not to
Great, thanks!
Tigrudo learned Acrobatics!
Roooaarrr!
All right! Looks like he's ready to go now!
Here, let me give you something to say thanks.
Time to practice until he perfects Acrobatics! It'll be a beauty!
Grrroooooarr!
Chump...
This is Macho 'Mon, the pro wrestling Machamp! He's been going through some hard times recently, though. Wanna hear about it?
Macho 'Mon was a real up-and-comer! He was a wrestler who was a once-in-a-century talent.
Lately, though, he keeps losing to the crafty veteran pro wrestler Incineroar. It looks like he's starting to lose his mojo.
Meh-chump...
If he only had a Coba Berry, he'd be able to hang in there when he gets hit by Acrobatics from Incineroar.
Would you look at that? You've got a Coba Berry right there, don't you?!
Would you let Macho 'Mon have that Coba Berry?
That'll be a big help!
You gave Macho 'Mon the Coba Berry!
MACHO!
All right! Incineroar's Acrobatics are no big deal anymore!
Time to learn his spots so he can make the most of that Coba Berry!
CHAMP!
Tigrudo and Macho 'Mon have a great rivalry now, pushing each other to the limit!
