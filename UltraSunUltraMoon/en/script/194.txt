Hmm? Oh, <var>, wasn't it?
This cave really is something, y'know? It's overflowing with these Pokémon called Diglett, and they are getting really out of hand. Mediocre Trainers can't even get through!
So, how's your island challenge going? Let me see which crystals you've earned.
Couldn't wait to come see me, hmm? But tackle Brooklet Hill first. It's right past Paniola Town.
OK, you're doing all right! How's that Waterium Z working out for you? Judging by how well you and your team get along, I bet you guys can do some real damage with it! OK, <var>, Kiawe's trial is next! Off to Wela Volcano Park you go!
It looks like you've tackled everything but Akala Island's last trial in Lush Jungle! Just relax and have fun with it. Your Pokémon will be happier that way, too.
Oh hey, since you're here on Akala... Have you made it out to our Dimensional Research Lab yet? Traveling about for your island challenge is about more than just trials, you know. Have a look around while you're at it.
Ooh, look at you, <var>! Nice work! I see you've even passed Mallow's trial. It's about time you had some fun with me! The Diglett have settled down, too. If you are as strong as you appear, you should be able to make it through this cave.
At the other end of it, you'll find Konikoni City. That's where my shop is. I'll see you there!
