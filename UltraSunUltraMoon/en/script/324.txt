<var>!
Hey, and it's Lillie...isn't it?! What happened to you?!
Yes, it's me! Now I'm ready to use my full force, too!
You're all...amazing! That's it! I've decided!
What?
I keep getting saved by <var> and my partner <var>, right?
If I keep being like this and I don't change, then I'm gonna get left behind by you all.
I really wanted to save Lillie and Cosmog! When my partner and I both felt that way and we were in sync, we were so much stronger... That's how it felt to me. So...
I'm gonna try to chase that feeling down again, together with <var> and my team!
So our family drama ended up changing the kind of Trainer you want to be... Sorry for getting you dragged into our mess.
Sure, you might've been a part of it... But in the end, the only one who's gonna make me change is me. And besides, Miss Lusamine is out there trying to keep Alola safe, right? I knew she was a good person!
I guess... She's always convinced that what she's doing is right, and she's really kind of selfish, but... But...I think she really just wanted to find our father, who disappeared into an Ultra Wormhole.
Hau... Thank you for your kind words. I'm really happy you feel that way.
I can get you to the next island at least. Poni Island. I'll wait for you at the docks.
Come on, <var>! Let's show the world what we can really do!
Guess I should wish you guys a good trip, huh? I'm gonna train up myself and my team real good before I see you again, <var>. Be ready for the shock of a lifetime!
