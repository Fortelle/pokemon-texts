Hey, I'm your friend Fred! I know every Trainer in the whole world, and I'm friends with every one of them. Just one look at a Pokémon you got in a trade from someone else, and I can tell you everything there is to know about its original Trainer.
Do you want to show him a Pokémon that you got in a trade?
I sure do
Not right now
That's not a Pokémon that you got from another Trainer, friend.
Come and show me what you got when you've actually traded Pokémon with someone else.
Eggs aren't really Pokémon, so I can't tell you anything about one of them.
Let's see... This <var>'s OT is... Ah! So <var> was its original Trainer! Of course! I know <var> well!
<var> is so kind, so nice... Why, one time when I was lost in a cave, it was <var> who led me to the exit and saved me! I'll never forget the warmth of that hand, tugging on mine!
<var> is a really handy Trainer! I busted my Ride Pager the other day, and I was in a real fix, when suddenly <var> appeared and fixed it in a flash! Those screwdrivers were moving so fast it was nearly blinding!
<var> is a real tough nut. I saw this Hiker fall from a cliff the other day, and what did <var> do? Spread both arms out wide and caught the guy! Even that Hiker was moved to tears by how strong and tough <var> was!
Did you know that <var> has a real unusual sort of a palate for food? I've seen <var> gobbling down Poké Beans right alongside Pokémon! And picking out just the Rainbow Beans, too! That <var> has some real gourmet tastes!
<var> is one speedy Trainer, yes, sirma'am! In the time it took me to drink down just a single bottle of Moomoo Milk at the Pokémon Center the other day, that <var> visited the main desk, healed up a whole team of Pokémon, checked out the PC, bought some Great Balls, sold a Nugget or two, and then gulped down a steaming hot Tapu Cocoa in one go before disappearing again as quick as you please!
That <var> sure has a fine voice for a Trainer, wouldn't you say? I happened to be standing nearby when <var> was having a battle, see? And that voice—that beautiful voice—was so captivating that not just the Pokémon on both sides but even the opposing Trainer was completely entranced by it, and the battle went nowhere at all!
That <var> is a Trainer you can count on, that's for sure! I wasn't paying attention the other day and got myself surrounded by a pack of 10 Rockruff. Boy, I thought I was done for! Then who should appear but <var>! That <var> could tell exactly which Rockruff was the leader of the pack, caught it, and then went on to catch every other last Rockruff till I was saved!
<var> has got real style—that is simply undeniable! I got to see <var>'s Trainer Passport the other day, and that head shot! Oh! The angle, the outfit—it was all so perfectly put together, I wanted to ask for a copy myself!
<var> is one serious person! I was riding around on Tauros the other day, dashing like there was no tomorrow, when I must've dropped my wallet along the way. But that <var> picked it up and came after me, miles and miles after me, to return it.
<var> really smells fantastic, don't you think? Every Pokémon and Trainer you see walk past <var> can't seem to help turning back for one last whiff of that sweet scent!
I hope you'll keep taking good care of that there <var>, and be sure to think of <var> when you do!
