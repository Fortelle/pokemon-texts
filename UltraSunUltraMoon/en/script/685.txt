Hey, hey! Do you know? Recently, ghosts have been appearing in the Trainers' School.
Everybody got scared, and nobody will even go near the school at night.
I hope someone—like a Pokémon Trainer who is strong enough to be acknowledged by the island kahuna—will solve the mysteries!
Hey, hey! It's big news! The seven mysteries at the Trainers' School all turned out to be misunderstandings!
That's right
I know
... ... ... ... ... ...
Wha—? You're the one who solved the seven mysteries?!
Wha—? You're the one who solved the seven mysteries?!
So cool! That's what you'd expect from a skilled Trainer who was acknowledged by the kahuna!
I'll give you my treasure to thank you for solving the mysteries!
But people still talk about the seventh ghost story. It's a mystery. About the student who was taken away by a Drifloon...
I've heard that there is a journal from those days somewhere in the Trainers' School.
... ... ... ... ... ... You are Trainer. Great. Help me.
Everyone scared. At night. School. There are rumors, seven mysteries. You check for me. You solve!
Kyukyu!
Please. OK?
Leave it to me!
Not now...
Thank you! I'm happy!
No? Sad... Come back when you can.
Seven mysteries... Which one you listen?
Stairs to nowhere
Scary PA system
Lord Slimy
Scary lights
Cursed diary
Ghosts' class
What's number seven?
Quit
Stairs to nowhere... Night, stairs, cursed. You go up and up, but still same place. You can't go down, either. Circle, circle. Can't go back.
Scary PA system... At night, teachers' lounge, second floor. You hear broadcast from beyond grave. You're done for if you hear it. You can't leave. It's over for you.
Lord Slimy... At night, you hear strange sound. Slimy, slimy—getting close. Footsteps of Lord Slimy... If you're found, Lord Slimy swallow you. You're gone.
Scary lights... At night. Near burning place. Scary lights show up and wander. Burning. Someone burning and crying. You hear girl's voice.
Cursed diary... It appears on the shelf, third floor. Keep reading, and scary thing happens. If you finish reading it, someone take you away.
Ghosts' class... At night, classroom, second floor. You hear laughter. Ghost are taking a class, too. Everyone says so.
Seventh story. I don't know. I'm very sorry...
Please solve! But careful... You in danger. I'm sad.
Stairs to nowhere. You solved? You great! Very great! Hmmm... I know now... Gastly's prank it was... Paper on board was hint! I see!
Scary PA system. You solved? Everybody happy now! Thank you! Hmmm... Yes... Speaker was broken. Yes, yes. It was not a scary thing. Good!
Lord Slimy. You found out? Great! How? What? Hmmm... ... ... ...I see... Cleaning Grimer... If you look closely, not scary!
Scary lights? You were not scared? You OK? Hmmm... Oh... Burned love letters... That all? We made mistake...
Cursed diary... Hmmm... Now I know. It's Drifloon's prank! My Drifloon always makes prank, too.
Kyukyuuun!
It took my hand... Pull me... Maybe is lonely? That why it does?
Ghosts' class. You solved? You so smart! Hmmm... Yes, yes... Hypno's trick... But it remember me. That is happy...
Other ghost stories. Please solve...
You, great! Very great! Seven mysteries. You solved all! No more scare. Great! Thank you. Thank you.
Great. I love school. If everyone scared, I'm sad. So I give this to you. My treasure. Drifloon gave it to me.
School, everyone, very kind. I came from far away. Here. Language different. I was in trouble. But I came to school. Everyone good. I love everyone. I want to protect school. Great.
Kyukyuuu!
The girl and Drifloon look happy...
Hey! You over there! What are you doing this late at night?
He seems to be the school's security officer.
The girl and Drifloon disappeared...
What's wrong?
The girl...
Drifloon...
Hahaha. Seven mysteries, right? Everybody talks about them. But you were alone.
Now I'll wrap up my patrol. You go home now!
Come back at night again... The seven mysteries will happen...
