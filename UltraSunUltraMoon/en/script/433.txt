Oh! What happened to the TV, <var>?
Mreow?
Now, I wonder who that is?
<var>!
Well, Alola, Lillie!
A-alola, ma'am. I'm so sorry to come barging in all of a sudden.
I was just watching the news at the professor's lab, and...andâ€” Did you see it, too, <var>?
I sure did!
An Ultra Wormhole!
Yes, an Ultra Wormhole opened up in the middle of the press conference! And then everything got so confused...
Maybe it was some kind of performance... I'm sure Mother must be fine, but...still...
I...I'm going to go see what is happening at Aether Paradise.
I guess...I just wanted to let you know. Sorry again for disturbing you!
Oh, did Lillie leave already? I thought she came over for a visit!
She did look worried, though... I hope everything is OK.
I'm glad that at least I never have to worry about you, <var>!
