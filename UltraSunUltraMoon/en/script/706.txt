Gaaah...
Hey, hey, did you notice? This little fellow seems kinda troubled...
What do you think could be bothering it? Do you have any idea, Trainer?
It dislikes the sand's color?
Maybe it's lost?
Gahhh! GAHHH!!!
Sandygast started flailing about wildly!
Whoa! You're some kind of amazing Trainer! You even understand how a Sandygast feels!
You're totally right, huh? Anyone can see it's made up of different sand.
It probably doesn't like being stuck on a black sand beach like this, huh? It's not like it's a Shiny Pok√©mon after all!
Sand... Gah...
Will you take Sandygast to a different beach?
Hmmm... Poor Sandygast doesn't seem very happy, huh?
Wow! You'll help out Sandygast? You're so nice!
Oh, look! Sandygast blends in lots better here!
Saaaaaannnd!
Sandygast looks really happy, too! Thanks a lot, Trainer!
Here, I'll give you this pretty thing I found on the shore before. Just as a little thank-you!
It's kinda surprising, huh? Even Sandygast have their own likes and dislikes!
