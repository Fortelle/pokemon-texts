I came all the way here to raise my Magikarp! I also wanted to be more independent!
I got transferred here, but there's no police station... Maybe I should make a police station on the back of my partner Wailord?
Out of the eight trials for the island challenge, two of them are at Poni Island. They're like... the beginning and the end!
Congratulations, Champion! So tell me, which of the eight trials was your favorite?
