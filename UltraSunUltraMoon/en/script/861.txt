I wonder if we should also fight to stop the evil actions of Team Skull...
Now we don't have to battle against those Team Skull ruffians anymore... It's a relief. But I feel a bit lonely, too...
Those Team Skull buffoons... They hurt Pokémon as if it's fun or something!
Even if those Team Skull buffoons aren't out there hurting Pokémon anymore... there are still plenty others that need our help!
Here at the Aether Foundation, we work to help protect Pokémon that have been hurt.
What do you think makes Pokémon happy? What is happiness, anyway? For me, it's enough to have friends that I can go eat with and have fun together with.
More Fresh Water? Still?! Your HP has to be fully recovered by now!
Whrrr-ulp-ulp-ulp!
The pamphlets tell about the Aether Foundation.
