Oh! Wait for me, <var>!
Oh, I'm glad to see a familiar face. I always get lost so quickly... I can't figure out the roads here... I can't even buy my own clothes...
But you... You're moving on to your first trial? You're going to Verdant Cavern?
Pew!
I read something in an old book once. It said that the island challenges were once a journey made to prove yourself and gain the strength to battle against the guardian deities of Alola. Like Tapu Koko... The people in Iki Town said that Tapu Koko loves Pokémon battles, didn't they?
If we could meet Tapu Koko once more, do you think we would find the answer to why it saved you and Nebby that day, <var>?
Pew?
Oh yes... Please take these. They are called Revives. If you use one on a Pokémon that has fainted, it will recover and feel a little better.
<var>... Good luck on your first trial. I will hope that it goes well for you.
