I had a great idea, <var>! Come on, let's have a battle!
Sure
No way
Aww! Are you just trying to bring me down or what?
All right! Then let's go full powered on this one!
You know what, <var>? You should take this Lycanium Z, too! It came as a set with those Big Malasadas that Ms. Wicke gave me, but I don't plan on adding any Lycanroc to my team or anything.
You and your Pok√©mon looked like you were having a blast, <var>! I guess it's like my gramps said... Go beyond winning and losing, and learn to find joy in any battle...then you'll find that you're getting strong before you even know it!
Trrril!
Mraw!
Brrril!
What? You mad that I still don't seem to be getting all that much stronger? I sure hope not! Me and my partner oughta be, like, totally in sync with one another!
We'll get there, buddy. Now I guess we should go try to track down Professor Kukui in Malie Garden, right?
