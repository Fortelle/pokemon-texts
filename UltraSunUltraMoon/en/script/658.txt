Aah... I don't know what to do...
What's wrong?
Starmie?
This Mysterious Pokémon, Starmie... It's my buddy, but...
it really loves staring contests...
It's been doing staring contests for a week.
I want to go home, but it won't move an inch unless it loses...
Slow...
Shashasha!
Enough of your cry of triumph. Let's go home, shall we?
Shasha!
Aaah... Seriously? You still want to do staring contests?
Is there a Pokémon that can beat my Starmie...?
If there were a Pokémon that knew Tickle, it would be able to beat my Starmie instantly, but that's not...
Whoa! You... That Pokémon!
Oh, wow! It knows the move Tickle, which lowers Attack and Defense stats by one level if it's used in a battle!
Please please do a staring contest with my Starmie right now!
Sha, shashasha!
<var> used Tickle!
Mie...mie! Mihaha.
It's super effective!
Wow... Starmie, the champ of staring contests, is being overwhelmed!
...Sha shahaaaaa!
Starmie burst into laughter! It lost!
Now you've lost. Let's go home.
Thank you very much.
This is a token of my appreciation. It think it will be useful for your journey.
Finally I can go home. Bye!
Shasha! Shasha!
Is the Mysterious Pokémon, Starmie, still trying to do a staring contest...?
