Have you been having a good time? You look a bit tired but happy. Take a little break before you head out there again, sweetie.
Sleep does the body good! Traveling is a true education! And unpacking...will be the death of me!
Can you believe those people who say that moving is a great chance to get organized? That's got to be some kind of joke, right? <var>? Meowth?
Oh! Look at that amulet you have there! Is that for the island challenge? Do your best to become an island challenge champ! I'll be behind you all the way!
You're doing great, <var>! You cleared the Melemele grand trial, right? Oh, yeah! And did you check out Ten Carat Hill near the Pokémon Research Lab? I heard there are rare Pokémon there!
Look at you! You've got friends like Hau and Lillie and your Pokémon all around you... You're really living every day to the fullest!
So come on, spill the beans... How far have you gotten? I'm talking about the island challenge, of course!
Catch lots of Pokémon, OK? Because I want to learn about lots of Alolan Pokémon, too!
As long as you have a love for adventure, then I guess you and your Pokémon's island challenge doesn't ever really have to end, huh?
Maybe Meowth and I should go on our own little island challenge... I could pass for 11, right?
I wonder what your little friend Lillie is up to right about now... I thought she had the makings of a fine Trainer.
Mrrrowr?
It's a watering can shaped like Wailmer, the Ball Whale Pokémon!

A new fridge bought right here in Alola!
It's a glass-top electric stove! You can cook right on its smooth surface!
A sparkling-clean kitchen sink!
It looks like it's probably food... But when did Mom buy it?
It's all Meowth's favorite Berries!
Here's Meowth's favorite dinner bowl. You brought it all the way from Kanto with you.
