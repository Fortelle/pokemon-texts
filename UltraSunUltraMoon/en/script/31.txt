And we're here! This right here is Iki Town!
This town is where folks come to worship the Pok√©mon that watches over Melemele Island. Tapu Koko keeps us all safe and happy, see!
Looks like the kahuna's nowhere to be found, though... I guess there must be some trouble somewhere on the island that needs fixing, yeah?
Yeah, the kahuna wandered off without a word to anybody, singing a little ditty or something.
I'm gonna go stop by home for a sec. I've gotta show my mom <var>!
Hey, I've got an idea for you, <var>. If you head through the village and up the hill, you can visit the ruins that belong to Tapu Koko. That's our island's guardian deity, yeah. Why don't you go and introduce yourself?
If you're real lucky, maybe you'll actually get a glimpse of the guardian deity yourself!
I'll stick around here and wait to see if the kahuna comes back.
