The castle... It's gone...
The Colress Machine has been activated, and it restored the mansion to its original form... Which means...you've done it! You defeated Team Rocket!
Mr. Colress! And Mr. Guzma!
Took you long enough!
For a Trainer such as you, who can bring out Pokémon's power through your bonds, it must have been easy.
The defeat of Team Rocket's boss seems to have sent everyone who had come with him back to their own worlds.
As for me... I have decided on the next theme of my research!
Well then, I hope to see you again sometime.
Mr. Colress... He's a truly great scientist, isn't he? Though he is also so very strange...
Ngh... Where am I...? Lillie...? And...<var>?
Madam Prez!
Mother!
<var> defeated Team Rocket for us!
What! HShe did?! It must have been terribly dangerous...
HShe did! It was really amazing!
Well, <var>, it seems you've saved the day once again.
I am truly grateful.
Mr. Faba!
Buagh!
P-P-P-President! I-I'm glad you're safe!
I still feel a bit dizzy, but... What of you, Faba? Are you unhurt?
Oh, yes, of course! No need to worry yourself about me, President! I'm just glad you're safe!
Mother! Mr. Faba was—
N-now, now, Miss Lillie! You must still be rattled from all the confusion and chaos caused by Team Rainbow Rocket!
I would never do such a thing as betray the foundation and invite Team Rainbow Rocket in, just to advance my career!
Branch Chief Faba.
... ... ...
I...
I'm sorry!
