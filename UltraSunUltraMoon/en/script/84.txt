Moo-aaarrr!
Ho! If it isn't Lillie and <var>. Sorry for scaring you, friend. I guess it's time I get old Tauros back home.
Oh, but I've got an idea... Why not give him a little pat, <var>?
Where will you try petting Tauros?
Pet its face
Stroke its mane
Grab it by the tail
Hrmmm. That doesn't seem to have impressed Tauros very much.
Bwoh!
Ha ha ha! You see that? This rascal already loves you! Pokémon become happier when we show them some care.
Wa ha ha! Oh the places you'll go, child! And as you do, you will surely meet more Pokémon and people who will enrich your life.
The kahunas sure are something, eh? Able to calm a raging Pokémon without even needing to battle... Now that's something! I mean, I like Tauros plenty and all... but it is pretty scary! I don't want to ride on it!
So where are you two off to now?
I was thinking I should show <var> around Hau'oli City a bit.
Nice idea! You're always on top of things, Lillie! <var> just got here to Alola, huh? Then let me tag along, too! I wanna go get something good to eat!
All right. Let's all go together.
Then what're we waiting for! This way! Come on!
Oh, Hau... I guess we should go catch up with him before he gets too far, <var>. Hau'oli City is the biggest city in all Alola.
Oh, Tauros... Well, at least it's nice that the Pokémon in Alola are so lively and such a part of everyday life.
Don't worry, <var>. That Tauros likes being petted by people.
