Oh! Here you are at last, <var>!
I've already been able to gather all of the intel we need about the UBs this time. So the chief has already left to help secure the site and protect the surrounding areas.
Hallo!
This precocious young lady here was my informant this time!
They sent me here on an errand. Since I'm not busy doing trials or anything.
Hmm? Who is that?
It's a secret. Oh, and I had one more order I was given. Or was it a request? Either way...
What might that be?
I was told I should have a real serious battle with <var> before I came back. I don't really know why, but it seems like maybe it's some sort of trial of strength.
So come on! Let's have a battle! Have a Pok√©mon battle against me!
Sure
Hold on
Shocking! You want me to wait? Fine then. I guess I can wait.
Is that precocious young miss powerful?
All right! Then let's get going already! Time for Mina to show you her full power! We'll get our Z on!
Whoa, you're surprisingly strong! Then it's no problem. Turns out, you're strong enough, <var>.
It seems that my precocious young miss here is not to be trifled with either...
OK, I'm out of here!
She is rather odd, isn't she? A real individual spirit...
But now we should get our heads on straight and get to work! I do not like it, but I am in charge of backup once again!
And for you, <var>. The Beast Balls you will need for this mission!
First, the regular reports, let us get them out of the way, my young friend... Madam Wicke finished analyzing all of the data that we gathered on the last UB you caught. If you wish to learn more about that creature, you should speak with Madam Wicke in the Aether Paradise secret labs! And now it is time we get to work. If you need to ask me anything, I am here!
I've finished sending the data from the UB you protected to HQ. And to Ms. Wicke as well. Thank you for your hard work, <var>. We should unravel the mysteries of Xurkitree, also known as UB Lighting.
Ngh...
Are you all right, ma'am?!
Y...yes... I'm fine, Mr. Looker. I just felt a passing vertigo...but I'm fine. Please do not worry yourself.
But I must! I insist on worrying! You have always had the stamina of a Machamp, Chief! I cannot believe this is nothing!
No, please... It is nothing so serious... I'm sorry for causing you to worry about me. I insist that I really am fine...
Putting all that aside, I must say that we have found a great ally in <var>. What a fantastic Trainer... It was all that I could do to simply keep that Xurkitree away from the town...
The UBs seem to get terribly aggressive when they spot me... It's like they are treating me as prey or an enemy...
I...I am sure it is only your imagination, Chief! You must be exhausted!


...I let myself in.
Mr. Nanu...
You been keeping well?
Y-y-you are...
Heh. So it's you, 100kr. Or... Sorry. What is it now? "Looker"?
...Yes. It is.
What's this? No smile for me? Here I am, coming out of my way to bring you the info about the UB that you're searching for.
Are you really?
That monster you're calling Blade... It's on Ula'ula Island. I'll tell you more when you get there.
That monster you're calling Blaster... It's on Ula'ula Island. I'll tell you more when you get there.
And your information... It is all true?
I'm the kahuna of Ula'ula Island. If you don't do something about that monster for me, our guardian's not gonna be happy.
Thank you...for the information, Mr. Nanu.
See you around then.
... ...
Mr. Looker?
Yes...yes, ma'am?
Mr. Looker... Do I take it that you are acquainted with Mr. Nanu?
I knew him once. I thought.
Never mind that... Right now we need to focus on our mission.
Of course... Yes, of course you're right. If we have reports of a new UB sighting, then our mission is our first priority...
I will move to Ula'ula island and prepare our new base in the motel there. Please join us there as soon as you are ready, <var>.
I will go to Ula'ula... I trust that you will, as well, <var>... The motel on Ula'ula Island is on Route 13...
