Hey there, honey!
Oh, hi!
This here's Professor Burnet. She runs the Dimensional Research Lab, yeah... And she's also my wife!
You're <var>, right? Lillie told me about you. She said you were the reliable sort.
Three months ago... I found Lillie lying on a beach. Cosmog in her bag also unconscious.
Hm? No Hau today?
Hau? He's out doing his own thing. But he'll be the real deal someday... He could even become a kahuna, just like old Hala before him!
You really think so?!
Whoa-ho! Well, yeah, I really do.
Good to see you again, Hau! It's been a while since I last saw you.
Anyhow, I brought <var> here because I wanted you to tell himer about some of the mysterious phenomena here in Alola.
I'd be happy to! The mysteries of Alola, huh? Then you've got to mean...
the Ultra Wormhole!
It's extremely rare, but sometimes a hole opens in the sky over Alola. It appears that this rift leads to a different and unknown dimension.
The reason that people think there may be a mysterious dimension is because of the legends of fearsome Pokémon appearing from the Ultra Wormhole.
Pew...
It's very weak as proof, but I can't ignore it. There is also plenty of evidence already in the Pokédex for the existence of different dimensions, right?
Fearsome Pokémon...?
Even normal wild Pokémon sometimes attack people, right? But the Pokémon that appeared from the Ultra Wormhole went way beyond that.
They were called Ultra Beasts... And they were feared. If the stories are to be believed, the guardian deities of the islands fought desperately against them.
But like I said, it's all legends and folktales. It's hard to know how much is true.
But I would be very happy if I could somehow unravel the mysteries of the Ultra Wormhole by studying the dimensional disturbances!
We've recorded several known relationships between Pokémon and different dimensions in books. You can find them on the bookshelves in this lab.
