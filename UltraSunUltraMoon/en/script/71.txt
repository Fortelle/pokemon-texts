You can reach the professor's lab by treading through the tall grass here. He says he can research moves better when he is so surrounded by Pokémon.
Since I'm not a Trainer, though, I have to rely on using Repels all the time. You do know that using Repel keeps Pokémon from attacking, right?
A-and about Nebby... Oh. I mean...Cosmog. Cosmog seems to be a very rare Pokémon. It came from far, far away.
Pew!
It seems to have a very strange power... It used that power to save me once when I was in danger.
But some...other people want Cosmog for themselves, to use that power. That's why only the professor and Kahuna Hala and other people I can trust know about it...
Can you keep a secret? Can you not tell anyone else about Nebby or what happened on that bridge? Please...
Oh...<var>? Do you want to know something neat?
You can reach the Pokémon Research Lab without having to go through any patches of tall grass if you jump down from this ledge.
Just like this.
Hyup!
If you'd like to take a shortcut, I suggest you try it, too. I'll be heading to the lab now, so see you there!
Not that way!
