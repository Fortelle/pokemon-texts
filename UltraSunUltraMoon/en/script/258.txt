Greetings, trial-goer. Let me check your collection of Z-Crystals.
It looks like you haven't yet earned your Electrium Z, have you? Take the bus that leaves from Route 10, and complete the trial that awaits you at the Hokulani Observatory!
Ho! Look at that blinding yellow Electrium Z!
Now I guess I'll have to open the gate for you!
What you face up ahead is the Ghost-type trial. I hope you enjoy it!
Haina Desert... It's a pretty fun place, don't you think?
I wonder what Tapu Bulu is thinking, off there in Haina Desert... What about Nanu could have made it think that he of all people would make a good kahuna?
