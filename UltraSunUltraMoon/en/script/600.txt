You're <var>, right?
See that, Red! I've still got it!
Oh, really? Look, maybe you can fool Red with that kind of act, but not me!

The name's Blue!
This guy is Red.
Nice to meet you. And hey, congrats to you on becoming Champion of Alola!
We were both Champions of the Kanto region, in our own days.
Nice to meet a fellow Champ, yeah? What do you say, Red?
... ... ...
Still as silent as ever, eh?
Look, I'm a Trainer. So, if I see another strong Trainer, I'm gonna want to fight them. So how about a battle? Which one of us'll you choose?
Red
Blue
...Kch. Fine. Look, I'll heal your Pokémon for you, so you'd better show me an awesome battle.
Yeah, you get it. Here, I'll heal your Pokémon for you, so let's you and me have an awesome battle!
...!
...!
Here I go!
You got me!
We were called here to be the new bosses of this here Battle Tree!
We'll definitely battle again...if you can manage to make it through the Battle Tree, that is! And when we do, I'll show you just what a top Kanto Trainer can do!
