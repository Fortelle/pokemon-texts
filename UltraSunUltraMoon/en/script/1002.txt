You can't know who will get named a kahuna or not, young'un, till they are chosen. Even humans sometimes have to live at the whim of some capricious Pokémon.
Team Skull was born outta this old group that once formed around one of the old kahunas. But that whole thing fell apart after they got smacked down by the wrath of the tapu!
If you make trouble for Pokémon, the tapu'll get mad at you, right? That's what I heard that old kahuna dude say to our big sis when he gave her a Z-Power Ring.
There are some books on the table... One is called "History of the Island Kahunas."
That stupid Guzma... He really is a prime idiot, isn't he!
