Pew!
Phew... Running around like this sure is tiring! Whoa! So the people of Alola meet in places like this, too, huh?
Calm yourself, Zossie. There is only one thing we are here to confirm. We must find someone strong enough to protect the Blinding One. Let us see if you might be the one!
I see... So that is a Pokémon battle... We had tried to investigate what it meant to battle with Pokémon, but it is quite different when you do it yourself. At least it seems that the Poké Ball we tried to create has worked properly to capture us a Pokémon here in Alola. And I have seen for myself how strong you are, young Alolan Trainer.
So, Dulse, what're we gonna do?
Trainer, you should know that this one here warps away if it is threatened in any way... And the holes that are torn open as a result invite dangerous beings into this world. But perhaps things will be all right as long as there are Trainers like you in Alola...
What about that other girl, though?
That girl should have nothing to do with our investigations, nor this Pokémon of hers... as long as no one is foolish enough to open a path that could lead here from Megalo Tower. Let us carry on, Zossie.
An elusive target, indeed...
Hmm. Soliera. Test this one. I would also like to check the functionality of that Poké Ball we tried making in the image of the devices used by these Alolan people. Now that we have at least succeeded in using one to capture an Alolan Pokémon specimen.
Yes, sir. I will do so at once.
I see... So that is what a Pokémon battle is! I suppose if there are strong Trainers like yourself around, we may not need to play any great role in this endeavor.
So then we do not need to bother with the other girl, I assume...
That one you have come to collect... You must know that it is able to warp away in an instant when threatened. You should remember, though, that the holes that are created when it does so leave a path open to dangerous beings.
Pew?
