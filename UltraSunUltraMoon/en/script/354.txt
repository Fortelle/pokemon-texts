Oh! Now that's a great composition! I could paint a picture of youâ€”the visitor to Poni!
Guess I didn't introduce myself though. I'm Mina. I'm the captain.
I mean, I sort of am. I actually just wander around doing my art, so I don't have an actual trial or anything...
But Vast Poni Canyon sure is a wonder, huh?
Once you've been through this place, you can really get to understand why that Ilima boy designed his trial the way he did, right?
Oh, yeah. Ohhhh, yeah. Here. Take this as a token of our acquaintance.
It's the Fairium Z. Get your Z on!
I'm the captain and all, so I've gotta come up with a trial. Maybe it could involve painting pictures and picking flowers... Maybe a trial like that could be cool?
See you later then! Alola, alola!
