Oh my. So it was another Wishiwashi that was kicking up all that water? Hmm. How unfortunate. It wasn't a strapping young Swimmer after all...
*splash splash splash splash*
Oh my word! Now what is that? Even more furious splashing? It sounds as big as a Wailord.
It might just be another Pok√©mon, but... Maybe, just maybe, we'll be lucky enough to find a spry young Swimmer floundering in the water and in need of saving!
Let's go investigate it, <var>!
It began to rain!
<var>! Hurry, let's go see what is causing all that splashing over there!
