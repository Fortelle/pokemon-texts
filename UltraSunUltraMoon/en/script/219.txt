Wicke. These two are still in the middle of their island challenge, aren't they? Please deliver them to their next island.
O-oh! At once, ma'am!
I will go to check that none of our poor resident Pok√©mon came to any harm. And I need to speak with Mr. Faba about exactly what happened downstairs.
It may be that our experiments to open an Ultra Wormhole are not going as well as we'd hoped.
I'll see the two of you to Ula'ula Island, then.
