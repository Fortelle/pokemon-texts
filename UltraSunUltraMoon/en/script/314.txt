If you want to see, you'd better hurry. This way.
Wh-what is this place...?
What do you think? It's my private collection. My precious babies... They will all be preserved for eternity here.
But if the light is stolen from this world, then I won't be able to love my babies any longer.
So I will open the Ultra Wormhole and take on the Pokémon that would steal our light... I will defeat even poor Necrozma!

Whoa! <var>!
Whoa-ho! And Lillie!
Man, I'm so glad to see you're OK!
Ah. Sweet Hau. So you came, too?
I know better than to expect much from the members of the Ultra Recon Squad, but really... Couldn't Guzma even stop a few children?
Listen to us. Please! Don't open the Ultra Wormhole! We can't lose anyone else... Not like we lost Father!
Do you think I've forgotten?! As if I could forget what happened that day... I hate the Ultra Wormholes from the depths of my being. But that is why I will be the one to go! I will not let anyone stop me! Not even my own daughter and son!
What? Daughter? Son?
Wait! You all are a family?!
Perhaps once we were... Sweet Hau. But those wretches beside you left me.
But I will still save them. With all the endless love of the president of the Aether Foundation, as someone tasked with the protection of all Pokémon...
I was able to open the Ultra Wormhole using just the gases we'd extracted from Cosmog when it was in Aether Paradise, wasn't I?
And now I have Cosmog itself inside this crate here. If I use its entire body, I should be able to control the Ultra Wormhole.
Please... Stop... If Nebby isn't— If you make it use up too much of its power... you don't understand what will happen!
Like when we ran away from the Paradise... it couldn't even move for ages after that...
If you use too much of its power, it will die!
I... I am Lusamine.
