Welcome to the salon! What would you like to do today?
Welcome to the salon, Champion! What would you like to do today?
<var>? That'll be $<var>, OK?
Well then, I hope we'll see you again soon!
Ohhh...um... I'm afraid you don't actually have enough here...
Oh, great! You've got a coupon! In that case, let me give you back half that!
I've got a free chair right over here. And you can set your things down right there.

Wow, <var>! So you caught yourself <var>? I know that Pok√©mon! It's great, isn't it? Gotta love <var>...
Looks like the weather will be good today, huh? I love this kind of weather. It makes me feel so relaxed and comfy.
Oh, by the way, <var>... You're taking part in the island challenge, right? I did it once, too, together with my partner. Must've been about five years ago now!
You know, some people get really nervous about making conversation while they get a haircut. But I only want my clients to feel comfortable, so it's totally fine to say nothing if you don't feel like talking... I'll just keep on talking myself, either way!
Now then! What kind of look are you going for?
It'll look just about the same as what you've got going on right now. You sure?
<var>, huh?
Then what about your bangs?
So you like the way they are now, right?
<var> for bangs this time?
OK. So let's just run through it to make sure that we're on the same page here... <var> for bangs, and... <var> for your hair, right? Got it!
<var>, right? Got it!
Then we'll just keep your current style in tip-top condition with a bit of clean up!
What do you want to do color-wise? Is there a color you're dying to try?
So you want to keep your current color? It's a good color for you.
<var> today, huh?
<var> it is, then! Let me just get a few things ready.
We'll just do a bit of touch-up to keep it looking fresh and keep it from fading.
And...all set! I've got everything ready now, so let's get down to work!
*snip snip snip*
All done! Ta-da! So, what do you think? Pretty fantastic, isn't it?
