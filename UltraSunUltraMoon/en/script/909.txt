The Haina Desert is like nature's own maze! But they say you can find your way through if you keep a close eye on those stone stacks... Someone once said that the answer is 2-1-4-3, but what is that supposed to mean anyway?
Pass pass!
It's living in a desert like the Haina Desert that makes you appreciate the value of an oasis. And it's the weaknesses of different types that really make you appreciate different Pokémon.
Wis-kahhh!
Hi-yo, Mudsdale! Away! I like to pretend that I'm like that hero I used to love when I was a kid.
You watch! I'm going to fish up every last Water-type Pokémon that lives in Alola's seas!
I...I feel like someone's eyes are burning into the back of my head. It's giving me the creeps!
Ohohoho! ♪
What? You got a problem, short stuff? I can stand guard even when I'm squatting!
Our big sis, Plumeria... She doesn't joke around when it comes to Pokémon training, you know! She doesn't joke around about much of anything, come to think of it...
Zzz... Zzz...
It looks so happy when it's sleeping! I just want to cuddle up and go to sleep, too!
Kah-wisss!
Puh-aaawn!

I used to be a Fisherman, but after I fished up a surfboard one day, I decided to become a Surfer instead!
Plumeria finally got serious about training up her Pokémon. She's even making your boy here help her out. I gotta admit, the way she can get her own way no matter who she's dealing with is pretty awesome.
I wanna do my best to take care of my homies and make sure nobody beats 'em down too hard. So what if I never became a captain or whatever. I'll always be big, bad Guzma!
