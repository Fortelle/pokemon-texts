My trial will test your powers of observation! There will be a dance...and then another. Your task will be to find the difference between the two. Begin!
Watch carefully and memorize this dance.
What was different from the previous dance?
The right Marowak
The middle Marowak
The left Marowak
Show me again!
B-but how?! That was truly spectacular! And to add to the spectacle... Come, Marowak!
Wa-wak!
Marowak was so pleased by your right answer that it simply had to battle you!
Astounding! It is astounding how wrong you are! Come, Marowak!
Wa-wak!
When you answer incorrectly, my Marowak grow so enraged that they cannot help but attack. Watch once more, carefully this time!
