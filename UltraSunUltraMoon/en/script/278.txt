Oh my. If it isn't <var>. Where might you be off to?
To see Team Skull
To Po Town
To see Team Skull?! You mean you're going to their base in Po Town?
To Po Town?! I-isn't that where Team Skull makes its base?
Such awful thugs they are, tormenting poor Pokémon for no good reason... I swear I just don't know what to do with them!
And just look at me, would you? Here I am, taking the initiative to travel Alola on my own to check on how Pokémon are doing. I've been trying to think through this Necrozma issue on my own. That sort of noble dedication is what you would expect of a president, even... Don't you agree?
Not that a foolish child could... Ahem. I mean, not that I would expect you to know. Anyhow. Do try to stay safe. Don't say I didn't warn you about Team Skull.
