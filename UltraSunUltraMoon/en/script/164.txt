So! <var>, Hau. How are your trials going? I hope you and your Pokémon are working hard and havin' a blast. Woo!
But, Mr. Masked Royal... How'd you even know that we're doing our trials right now? Oh! I get it! Because of our amulets, huh?
Well, I'm having a blast!
But why are you here? Why would you even wanna do a Battle Royal? You still trying to get stronger or something? Or maybe you just want to make some friends? Heh heh!
I'm not here to play. I'm here because you can't protect anything when you're weak.
...Wow. You're just a ray of sunshine, eh? I think you'd have a lot more fun if you just let yourself have a good time with everybody else. You can do a lot more together, too!
Well, I don't know what his deal is, but I thought that battle was just plain fun! That's why I'm gonna keep doing Battle Royals. And my Pokémon seem to like them, too!
