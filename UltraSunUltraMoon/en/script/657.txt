Waaaaagh!
Eesh! That was some loud holler... I wonder what's going on?
Did somethin' happen?
Uh-oh... Headmaster's gonna be so angry...
What's wrong?
Headmaster?
I tripped, and I scattered Stardust all over the room... Just when I had finished cleaning, too! ...Oh, Headmaster is what we call our Oranguru.
I gotta clean up all the Stardust! But there's so much, I don't know if I can do it by myself...
I'll help
Good luck!
Yeah, I'll do my best! But if I can't finish it on my own, you'll help me, right?
There is Stardust everywhere!
Thanks! Let me know when you find any Stardust. I'll clean it up!
The toys are covered in Stardust!
Wow, so much dust... Gotta make it spick-and-span again!
*rummage rummage* *brush brush* *dig dig* *sweep sweep*
Hey, I did it! It's all clean again!
All right, I'm gonna keep this up and make everything all sparkly and clean!
Stardust is all over the floor...
Oh no, there, too?! Dust goes in the dustbin!
*sweep sweep* *brush brush* *wipe wipe* *gather gather*
There is Stardust in the gap between the wall and the shelf!
Hey, you're right! I'm gonna need to dig that out.
The window is covered in Stardust! It needs a good polish!
Eek, the window's a mess! I gotta put my back into it and wipe it off...
*wipe wipe* *polish polish* *rub rub* *squeak squeak*
Hmmm... I think that's it! The room is sparkling clean! And the headmaster didn't catch me, either! Thanks for helping me out!
Foryu...
Hey, the headmaster had been saving that! You're so lucky! But why'd he give it to you?
...Goof.
Hey, I'm still cleaning!
