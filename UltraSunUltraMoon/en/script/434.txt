<var>?!
Oh, everything is a mess! Mother! And Aether Paradise! It's all... It's just all so... It's all gone wrong!
Are you OK?
Calm down
I-I'm sorry... I'm just so worried...
It's good to see you again, <var>. Please, let me explain the situation.
As you may know, the president called a press conference to address the black clouds that engulfed Poni Island, but...
An Ultra Wormhole suddenly opened, and a mysterious force took over her mansion!
The culprits call themselves... Team Rainbow Rocket.
I've heard of Team Rocket before, when I was in the Kanto region... They were an underground criminal organization that used Pokémon for their activities. I think this organization has come to Alola now...
And Mother... Wicke says that Mother has been taken captive by this Team Rainbow Rocket!
I am trying to come up with as many ways to save the president as possible, but... to be honest, the situation isn't good. The enemy is too powerful, and on top of that we don't even know why they're interested in the Aether Foundation!
I...I want to save my mother. But we just aren't strong enough on our own...
I know this is a lot to ask, but if you could lend us your strength, <var>...
Of course!
It's all yours!
Oh, thank you so much! I feel so much better, knowing you're on our side, <var>!
I feel so much better now, knowing you and Nebby are on our side, <var>!
There's a swarm of Team Rainbow Rocket Grunts ahead. Take this—you might need it.
Please, be careful, you two!
Of course!
I will keep trying to find a way to fight back on my end, too. ...I swear, where has Faba gone to at a time like this?
