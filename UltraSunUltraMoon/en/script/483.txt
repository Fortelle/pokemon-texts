Here, <var>. I'll give you this Electrium Z to reward you for beating the Totem Pokémon.
Come on, Soffy—you still need to show himer the proper Z-pose to use it!

Congratulations on clearing your trial! And Sophocles did well as captain, too.
I was really nervous...
Don't you worry. I'm sure that I made the right choice in naming you captain. Even if you are my cousin.
Usually it's the island kahuna who appoints the captains. But there are some, er, unusual circumstances here on Ula'ula.
So somehow I ended up captain...
But you were really great, <var>.
