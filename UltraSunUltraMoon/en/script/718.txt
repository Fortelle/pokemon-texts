This is excellent! Exciting, even! Alola is proving to be just full of surprises!
If a Trainer trusts his or her Pokémon, even in the most extreme of situations, the Pokémon inevitably respond by unleashing their full power! Just like that Trainer I once met...
There was only one answer I could reach. And in Alola, that answer takes the form of Z-Moves!
I can now see with my own eyes the invisible power between Trainers and Pokémon... Z-Moves give it form!
The Z-Power Ring and Z-Crystals... Their unknown energy will open doors to new worlds!
I must know... Why did Necrozma give its light energy to the Pokémon of Alola in the form of auras?! As Z-Power?! Hmm... If I want to find out more about moves, I suppose I should ask Professor Kukui, or even the Masked Royal! Maybe I'll go battle them!
