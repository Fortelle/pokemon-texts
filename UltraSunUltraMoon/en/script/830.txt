I only Mantine Surf when I'm not working at the Tide Song Hotel. Actually, I should say I only work there when I'm not Mantine Surfing!
You can only pull off amazing moves if you're working together with the Mantine! And all that cooperation makes me hungry! I always have a huge meal after I pull off moves!
Glub glub.
Bloop?
You can't really talk to your partner if you go Mantine Surfing on a date... Not that I would be up for conversation, anyway. I'm always too focused on making moves!
I almost drowned once, when I was young... I only survived because a Mantine swooped in and rescued me! I was really touched by how kind Pokémon can be.
Welcome to Akala Island! You'll find plenty of nature here!

You can Mantine Surf at special Surf Spots! Enjoy surfing with... You guessed it! Mantine!
