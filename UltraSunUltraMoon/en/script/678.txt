What are the rules?
No thanks
If you would like to experience my lovely Charjabug puzzle, come anytime!
You see there are four buttons on the Roller?
You can rotate the panels by pressing the buttons...
And by doing this, you also move the Charjabug that are on top of them!
However, you can only press the buttons four times! Not a single press more!
Be sure the Charjabug are facing the same direction as the marks on the panels, too.
Now! Which difficulty of the Charjabug puzzle would you like to experience?
