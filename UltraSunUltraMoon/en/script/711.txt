The name's Ryuki. I'm what you might call a star. I mean, with partners like my Pokémon, how could I not be a star? I came all the way across the sea here to Alola to challenge the Pokémon Gym!
But this Kantonian Gym here... This isn't a real Pokémon Gym. Still, I dig it here. It's got a feel to it, man. It's got spirit.
Hey, Trainer. I can feel your spirit, too! Want to have a battle with Ryuki?
Hey, Champ! Why not have a battle with me? Let our fiery spirits clash in a blaze of glory!
Sure!
No thanks!
I don't blame you. I'm a rocker down to my core, after all!
Allow me to introduce my band mates! Come on, babies!
All right! My babies were all fired up to play a set, but you chilled them out nicely!
Once Alola gets a real Pokémon Gym, I give you my word I'll become the Dragon-type Leader!
The name's Ryuki. I'm what you might call a star. And now, you're a star, too! There's only one thing two stars can do—get the crowd fired up with a blazing, rocking Pokémon battle!
Hey, no encores! I pour my spirit completely into one battle, one move!
That's right, a Dragon Scale! I've poured my spirit into it, too!
Hey! You're curious about what kind of item the Dragon Scale is, aren't you? Well, you'll have to figure that out for yourself!
