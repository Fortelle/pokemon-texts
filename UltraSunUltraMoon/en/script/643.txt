Hey, hey, hey! Don't tell me... Are you maybe a trial-goer? Hm?
There's a favor I've been just dying to ask a Trainer like you...
I'll help you!
I'm a little busy...
Oh, well, aren't you just the sweetest! Thanks! No, thank you! I'm so glad!
I'm a muy excelente hair stylist, you see! But I just came here to the Alola region... And I've heard this rumor that I just can't help wondering about...
That's right...
I've heard that there is a Pokémon in Alola that has beautiful curly hair! ¡Hermosa!
I have got to see it, even just for a moment! And if I could, I'd love to touch its hair! I've been so distracted by my desire that I've been completely useless at work!
But I don't even know what that Pokémon might be called...
That's why I came up with this genio plan! A trial-goer like you must know tons about all kinds of Pokémon!
Please, please catch that beautifully bemaned Pokémon for me, and show me your Pokédex!
I'll reward you, of course! So please do me a favor here!
Ahhh... I just can't wait to meet it! Please show me those luscious locks!
Th-that's...Jynx! Yes, it surely does have luscious locks, but that's not the Pokémon I was looking for! The rumors were about bouncy, curly waves!
No way?! You caught it! You caught that masterfully maned Pokémon!
Oh! Please! Please show me at once!
Oh! Look at what fantástico condition its hair is in! Not a single split end in sight?! I never imagined such a thing... A Dugtrio with hair! Huh? What do you mean it's not hair? You're telling me it's...whiskers?! And it's called a regional variant? So this is a special form unique to Alola! ¡Caray!
Well, I am muy contento now! I'm totally full of thanks for you!
I'll give you one of my precious treasures to thank you for your hard work! ¡Muchas gracias!
Now I'm off to get one of those fancy follicled friends for myself!
I hope you'll come check it out when I do! Alola!
Oh... Well, that is a real letdown, but please help me out if you ever find the time!
