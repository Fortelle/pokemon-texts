Hey there, whippersnapper. Did you know that Quick Link lets you connect to somebody nearby in a flash? Though you never know who you might end up connected to if there're lots of Trainers about!

Everyone says you have to visit the garden if you're visiting Malie!


Hey, stranger! The Recycling Plant is all you'll find up that way. Not that I'm saying you can't visit it if you're interested. Just thought you should know.
Grimer eat garbage. But if they run out of garbage to eat, sometimes they start taking bites out of nearby buildings. We Janitors have to use our formidable skills to keep them in check!

You looking for Route 10? I went that way and got thoroughly thrashed by all those bird Pokémon attacking me! If you're really set on going down that route, make sure you get ready first here in Malie.
I dunno if you'd describe the bird Pokémon in Alola as being comfortable around people... or just plain aggressive!
Hi! I'm your friendly neighborhood officer who just can't get enough of giving out directions! You're a trial-goer, are you not? Well, Trainer, if you head up from here you'll find the library!
I'm your friendly neighborhood policeman! I can't get enough of giving people directions. So, my young trial-going Trainer, I've got some directions for you! If you head straight up from here, you'll reach the library. Go to the left, and you'll find Route 10. Head down, and you'll get to Route 11!
Poli poli.
Zzt, zzt, zzt... Zzzzt...
Sea-laaa...
