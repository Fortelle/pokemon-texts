<var>! It's been a while since I last saw you around. But weren't you supposed to meet with the professor in Malie Garden?
Oh, <var>, I'm glad I ran into you... I was actually wondering...
Pew?
Wh-what did you think of her? The president of the Aether Foundation, I mean.
She was nice
I don't know
Is...is that right? Of course. She must be nice. She's trying to protect Pok√©mon, isn't she?
Right... Of course... I just thought maybe you'd met with her. I'm sorry for asking you something so strange.
Um, anyway... What I really wanted to ask about was...
You want to go to the ruins?
Is it about Nebby?
Yes. I want to take Nebby to visit Ula'ula's ruins, but they are located deep in a large desert. I don't want to ask that much of you.
Right now, I'm planning to visit Malie Library. There's a book that I want to look for there. Maybe you'd even be willing to help me?
I know that Malie Library is here within the city of Malie somewhere... Even I should be able to find it. I can do this!
Pew!
