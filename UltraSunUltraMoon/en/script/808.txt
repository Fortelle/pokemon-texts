Rockruff there was a wild Pok√©mon when we got her, but now she's like a part of the family. When I see her roughhousing with my little girl, I can't help but smile!
My Rockruff is the best bodyguard ever! She always comes with me when I go shopping, and she lies outside my door when I sleep!
Ruff ruff!
