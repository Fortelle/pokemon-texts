Cripes, but I hate this place... It's exhausting climbing all the way up here.
At least you gave me a good show, though. Guess it was worth coming this far. And the prof did ask me and all...
Look, once you've completed all your island trials and done your grand trials, then you've got to do one last thing... The final trial.
Basically it's a ceremony, you see? You beat all four kahunas in a row. But things are a little different this year. Now that we're getting a real Pokémon League here in Alola, too.
So, boy. I hope you can bother yourself to come along to the base of Ula'ula Island's Mount Lanakila. You remember Tapu Village, don't you? Where they've got a Pokémon Center? He'll be ready and waiting for you there.
So, girl. I hope you can bother yourself to come along to the base of Ula'ula Island's Mount Lanakila. You remember Tapu Village, don't you? Where they've got a Pokémon Center? He'll be ready and waiting for you there.
I suppose I could take you along with me... You want to do that? Come now, with me?
Looks like we're on this journey together, then.
Not many kids make it all the way to the final trial, but there's a handful every year. You won't be able to go easy on this one. These are real battles. No holding back.
