So you came...
I guess I've got to thank you again for all you've done for my family... Especially...for Lillie. I never knew she could smile like that.
My mother's desires to reach Nihilego... and what she did in order to achieve that goal... I know she was completely out of control. But that doesn't mean I can't understand it.
It was my father who started it. He was the one who first confirmed the existence of Ultra Wormholes and Ultra Beasts.
But my father... He disappeared during an experiment. Trying to connect to an Ultra Wormhole. All that he left behind was a weakened Cosmog and his papers about Nihilego...
Lusamine's obsession with Ultra Wormholes... and her obsession with the Ultra Beasts... I think it was all basically her way of trying to reach him again. That's what I had to believe. To get through it.
It's not an apology or anything, but... I hope you'll take this fellow.

And I'll give you all the memory drives that let its Evolution, Silvally, change its type...
You received a whole stack of memory drives!
This is a different Type: Null. Not the same one that I ran away with... It was kept in Secret Lab A. Its very existence was a secret.
But I think I know you well enough. I think I can trust you to show it the world.
Hmph... Maybe it's time I see a bit more of the world myself... and starting with that Pokémon League, I think. I hear that Alola's got a real strong Champion.
You can't even take Type: Null? How many Pokémon have you collected? I can't even believe you... Fine. Come back when you're ready to take it.
