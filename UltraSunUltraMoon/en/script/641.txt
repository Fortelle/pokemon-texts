When I was young, I walked A LOT! For example... Stand on the white square... From there...pass the white triangle, the black triangle, the black circle, the white circle, the black triangle, the black square, the white circle, and the white triangle, and come back to the white square. I was able to walk that much!
Oh, young Trainer. You seemed to have followed the symbols just as I told you. I was watching your healthy walk or run!
Walk and walk in places where there are Pokémon or no Pokémon. Go wherever your young heart leads you! Be healthy!
You stepped on the correct symbol.
Hmmm? Did you step on the wrong symbol?
