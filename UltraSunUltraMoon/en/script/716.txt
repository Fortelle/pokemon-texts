Ah, Diancie... The sudden transformation of the Jewel Pokémon Carbink...
As one who loves rocks and jewels above all, this Pokémon is a dream come true!
I would be happy to see it in person, even if just for an instant...
Hm? That, in your party... Is it... A Diancie?!
Eeeheeheehee! Diancie! I could dance with glee!
How it's born, as well as the probability of such an event, is completely unknown!
A glistening, shimmering mystery, beyond the reach of modern science!
Its perfect form, known as the quintessential standard of absolute beauty...
absorbs a perfect balance of the various spectrums of light, resulting in...
a gleam so perfect, so magnificent, that it is called a miracle of this world.
But that's not all! A Diancie becomes even more beautiful upon Mega Evolution...
achieving what one can only describe as transcendental beauty beyond imagination!
Its glorious, captivating form is known by all as...
*pant pant*... *pant gasp*...
...Thank my fortune that I met you! Here, let me share my joy!
See for yourself the regal beauty of Diancie, the Royal Pink Princess!
the Royal Pink Princess of the Pokémon world!
