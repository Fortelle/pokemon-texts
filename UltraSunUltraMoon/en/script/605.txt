So... I see you've had <var> battles against other Trainers...
It seems you understand how Pokémon types match up perfectly!
Oh ho! And you take advantage of Pokémon's Abilities in battle, too!
I wonder if any Trainer can defeat you and <var>!
You're so powerful... You may have gotten the attention of the tapu.
How...how powerful can one become?! You seem to have pursued victory above all else!
Battle after battle...even when you have to stop, it's not long before you're up and at it. Keep striving for victories—find something there that only you can find!
I see... You've had more battles than I could possibly count!
Now then... I wonder if you can seize victory even from me?
I will
I don't think so
No need to force yourself if you're not feeling it. That's important if you want to keep winning.
I've also experienced many battles—maybe even more than you! Now, it's time to see who is truly the better Pokémon Trainer! No holding back!
Everything will work out, if you choose to keep fighting for victory! Oh, and speaking of choice, let me give you Choice Specs! If a Pokémon holds them, they'll be stuck using only the first move they chose in battle, but their Sp. Atk will be boosted by 50 percent!
