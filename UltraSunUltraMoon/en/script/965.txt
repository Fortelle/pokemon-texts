Why is it that the clothes I want to wear are never the clothes that actually suit me?
Bull...
It's less of a fight if I just let my wife pick out what she likes for me...
Too plain! You've got to deck yourself out in as much color as a Muk or you'll just look old!
When you think of jumpsuits as clothes that're designed to get dirty, doesn't it make you love them that much more?
