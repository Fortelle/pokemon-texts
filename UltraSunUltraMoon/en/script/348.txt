Phew... This canyon truly is a difficult path to walk. And you even make the Vast Poni Canyon seem like nothing at all, <var>!
This bridge reminds me of the first time that I met you, <var>...
I'd taken Nebby with me, but I didn't have the courage to protect it myself...
I couldn't do anything... But I'm not that person anymore!
Oh...
<var>! I did it! I made it all the way across!
Someday... I'd like to be more like you, <var>. I want to fight together with Pok√©mon and become strong enough to outdo even myself.
Yeah!
You've still got a way to go
Hee hee!
Oh, you spoilsport!
But it's really thanks to you, <var>... You're the reason why I've come so far! Still...I think I'll take a little rest here. I'm afraid my legs are still shaking!
<var>, do you want a rest, too?
Don't worry. I've got you covered! I have Hyper Potions and Revives and even lots of Ethers, too. Though I'm not sure I brought enough Max Repels for a path like this one...
