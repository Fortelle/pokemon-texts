Welcome to Aether Paradise. The Pokémon sanctuary is on the upper floor.
A good Trainer catches Pokémon to raise them with all due care. That's a kind of refuge, too.
The president is such a nice lady. She invites trial-goers like us here to tour the Aether Foundation.
Is the president all right, do you think? I'm worried after seeing that news broadcast...
They say we're to ship these greens that Farfetch'd like to eat to other lands. Here, why don't you take one, too?
Apparently the Farfetch'd populations have been dropping in other regions because they can no longer find as many of these greens that have traditionally been their food source.
We're here to study how things are done here at the foundation. The goals of this place are pretty much in direct opposition to Fuchsia City's Safari Zone.
STAFF ONLY! All others will not be permitted entry!
Excuse me! Yes, you there! I know I'm too far to catch you from here— But no one is allowed through there but staff! Please step away! P-please...
Rauw?!
This is the ultimate in scientific progress made manifest! We call it the Beast Ball! Because it's you, I'll sell them to you for a low, low $1,000 apiece. How many would you like?

These balls were made with the combined tech of the foundation and the Ultra Recon Squad!
Um... But you don't have enough money!
I'm sorry, but it looks like you can't carry that many at one time...
D-did you bring that Stick with you?! Those Team Rocket people are crawling all over the place! You'd better be ready for them!
Aughhh! This is no time for a tour! Rockruff, what're we gonna do?!
*whine*
Have you heard the news? That Pokémon mafia has come to take over our foundation!
Is the president all right? Please save her...
All visitors should please evacuate in a quick and orderly fashion! Please!
Please! You mustn't go anywhere near the president's mansion! Oh, but...you're the Champion, aren't you?! I suppose you don't have anything to fear from Team Rocket then!
