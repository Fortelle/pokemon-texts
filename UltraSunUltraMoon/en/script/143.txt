Stop right there!
Ah ha ha! We didn't mean to surprise you. You must be doing your island challenge.
I'm Dexio.
My name's Sina! A beautiful name for a beautiful lady!
We're here seeing the sights in Alola. Its unique tradition of island challenge... It's pretty fascinating, I've got to say.
Oh, I've got an idea! You and Dexio should battle!
And why should we do that? Though I might as well test my skills. Is that all right with you?
Then I'll let my partners go wild!
If you'd ever like to battle, I'd be willing. Just ask.
Oh, I've got an idea! Why don't you test your skills with me?
OK! Let's get this show on the road!
OK, I'll wait till you're up to the challenge of my awesome team!
That's what I would expect from a Trainer doing the island challenge. I felt the bond between you and your Pokémon!
I get it... Facing trials helps you grow close to your team. I think that's absolutely wonderful!
I feel like I've been able to have a glimpse of the island challenge! Let me heal your Pokémon as thanks!
You and your Pokémon are the ultimate team! No doubt about it! This battle reminded me of us in the past...and that group of five young Trainers. Take this as a little token of our new friendship!
Maybe training yourself up a bit on Route 4 will help you understand your Pokémon even better. We'll be taking our leave now! Bon voyage!
