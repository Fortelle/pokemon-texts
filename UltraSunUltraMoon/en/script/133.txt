Good timing, <var> and Hau! I've just got the old girl all ready to set sail.
Oh. Yeah. So, about that, Professor...
I was thinking that I'd really like to head to Akala Island with Mantine! And I want to see <var> take a shot at Mantine Surfing, too!
Mantine?
But the boat?
Shoots, yeah! The Mantine from Big Wave Beach on Route 2. You saw them, right?
Aw, come on! I really want to ride on a Mantine! Don't you? And I'm totally not just saying that because the professor's boat is such a junk heap, either.
Right... Well, Hau, it's all up to you! The island challenge is all about journeying together with Pok√©mon, after all!
Yeah! So I'll see you on Akala Island, Professor! <var>! If you wanna go together, I'll be at Route 2's Big Wave Beach!
