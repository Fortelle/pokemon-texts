What a stunning sunset! All right, today's the day that I finally unpack—
Was that the doorbell? Go see who it is, <var>.
Hey there, <var>! It's about time we set out for the festival, yeah!





But first...I've got something to teach you, yeah, now that you're a real Pokémon Trainer.
It's the most basic of all the basics. Come on—to Route 1!
Have fun at the festival, sweetie! I'm sure you'll have a good time with your new Pokémon pal!
Me and Meowth will be sure to unpack every last box here—you'll see!
Mreee?!
Mrowr!
