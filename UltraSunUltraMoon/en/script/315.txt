Oh?
You are trying to resist, aren't you, Cosmog? But why? For Lillie's sake, perhaps?
P...ew...
How gallant you are... You love Lillie, don't you?
Heh heh... Perhaps Gladion and Lillie have both grown up a bit since leaving Aether.
But I still won't allow them to interfere with this.
If I am going to protect the Pok√©mon of Alola, I must go through the Ultra Wormhole and meet this Necrozma!
I will have Cosmog open the Ultra Wormhole. No matter what. I will use the power of its cage to ensure that it cannot resist any further!
