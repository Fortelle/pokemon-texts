What do you want? I've...got a lot on my mind right now. I bet a strong Trainer, like Mr. Guzma, would be able to help me out, but...
You...you seem like a pretty strong Trainer. Do you think maybe you could hear me out?
Oh, OK... Ugh, what should I do...
Well, see, there's something that's been bothering me for quite some time...
And the truth is...
... ... ... ... ... ...
...And that's the problem.
I don't get it...
What's the problem?
What...? How could you not get that?!
I can't do the Team Skull pose! How can I call myself a Team Skull Grunt if I can't do it?!
The hand movements are just...too complicated! I can't remember all the moves! But all my homies in the team can do it, no problem at all...
All right! Maybe I should just leave the team!
Hey, thanks for hearing me out... You helped me make up my mind!
Yo yo! We heard that bit, yo!
Are you, like, serious? Are you literally saying you'll leave Team Skull?
Is it you, kid? You who we got to thank for our homie's crazy talk?
W-wait! You've got it allâ€”
Right on, yo... If you wanna mess with our homie, you gotta go through us, yo!
Whoa... This fool's mad strong, yo!
Hey, wait up a moment! You've got the wrong idea!
HShe was just hearing me out! It's not hiser fault I decided to leave Team Skull!
Say what?!
It's just that... No, I can't tell you...
Spit it out, yo!
Like, why can't you literally tell us, homie?!
Say it! Say it! Spit it out, yo!
I've had enough! Just leave me alone!
I've made up my mind to quit, YO!
W-wait... Did I just...?!
You did it!
Still want to quit?
This means I-I-I won't have to quit Team Skull! Yeah!
Sorry to get you tangled up in all of this... Here, take this! My treat!
Hope we'll be seein' you around, YO!
You're stayin' our homie, right? Aww, I'm literally tearing up!
Great to hear, yo!
