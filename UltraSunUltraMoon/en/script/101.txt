Hey, little cousin! Welcome to Big Wave Beach! You've come to exactly the right place if you're looking for some Mantine Surf!
Mantine Surf is just what it says on the box. You climb up on the back of our Mantine... and then you surf! Surfing is the best sport, where you can enjoy traveling across the ocean waves!
Though youngsters like yourself who want to get into Mantine Surf have to toughen up and show that they can really handle it first. Surfing is a bit of a dangerous sport, to be fair.
Come back when you're as tough as a real kahuna, OK? Me and Mantine will be holding our breath in anticipation till you do! Wait, do Mantine breathe? Can they even hold their breath?
