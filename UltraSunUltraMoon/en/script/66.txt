That was a most mysterious event... A festival to celebrate drawing forth one's full power...
You looked like you were enjoying the show. Did you want to take part in the battles, too?
Don't be silly... We are here to investigate and learn.
Even with all of our technology, we cannot control the Blinding One's light... Thus we are left with no choice but to try to stop it by force! And yet it seems that the humans of this Alola can wield powerful auras.
Yeah, what'd they call that thing? A Z-Power Ring? Its aura readings were off the chart! Do you think that's why they can control auras like that? Alola is definitely an amazing place! Let's go check the next site!
Captain... I was able to detect high levels of aura at this full-powered festival.
I suppose you would... According to our earlier research it seems that the Z-Power Ring and this Tapu Koko creature are bathed in a great deal of light.
Alola overflows with the light that was released by the Blinding One... I find myself rather envious.
I wonder if we can't find some way to use the great power that fills Alola for ourselves...
That is precisely what we, the Ultra Recon Squad, are here to make clear. Onward! There is still so much of Alola we have not seen, and we must investigate it all!
Tapu Koko is amazing, isn't it? I hope I can meet it again someday and thank it for saving Nebby...
Pew!
Me, too
Oh yeah?
It saved you as well, didn't it? And left you with that Sparkling Stone... even though you're a stranger to this place.
You know, <var>... it did save your life, too. And it even gifted you that Sparkling Stone... even though you're a stranger to this place.
Suppose it's time we get you kids home, yeah?
Nebby... Alola is full of all kinds of wonders, isn't it?
