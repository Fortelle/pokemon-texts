Did you get a Pokémon from the island kahuna or professor maybe? It doesn't matter if it's evolved into something else since then. As long as it's a Fire-, Water-, or Grass-type Pokémon that new Trainers are given around here, and it's really friendly toward you, I'll teach it a special move—a battle-combo move.
A special move... Shall I teach your Pokémon a battle-combo move?
There is no move that I can teach to any of the Pokémon you are with...
I see... Well, see you next time.
Which Pokémon will it be then?
That Pokémon can't learn a move from me.
Do you want me to teach my move to an Egg?! You are being unreasonable.
This Pokémon... It doesn't look like it's too comfortable with you yet.
That Pokémon already knows one of my moves.
Do you want me to teach <var> <var>?
My favorite Pokémon are all the Pokémon you get from people like professors or kahunas. I teach special moves—battle-combo moves—to those Pokémon and the Pokémon that evolve from them. That's what I do!
Please choose a move that will be replaced with <var>.
<var> learned <var>!
1, 2, and... ... ... Ta-da! <var> forgot how to use <var>. And... <var> learned <var>!
<var> did not learn <var>.
