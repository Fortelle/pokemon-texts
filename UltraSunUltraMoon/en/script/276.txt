M-my Yungoos...
We can't forgive this!
Darn it, those numskulls actually did something pretty clever for once!
If we want to get the Pokémon back... then <var> has to go to Po Town... All alone? With no backup? That's what they said, but...that's not fair!
Team Skull has taken over Po Town... It's basically their private playground now. Oh! I know! If you're gonna go, though, try to find this guy on Route 15 who's wearing a kimono... He might be able to help you get to Po Town. He knows a whole lot about Pokémon that can travel across the water. 
H-here. Take this... Just...just get my Yungoos back for me!
I feel so alone and scared without my Pokémon... I can't sleep at night without her...
You're gonna help us, aren't you? You're strong, right?
You're gonna help us, aren't you? You're strong, right?
I-I'm sorry, <var>. It's my fault... Now you've got to put yourself in danger because...I couldn't stop them...
Pokémon being abducted like that... Maybe even hurt... I just can't stand the idea! <var>! Please...help them!
Pew...
