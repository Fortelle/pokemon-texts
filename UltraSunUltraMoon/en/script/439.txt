Prepare for an interruption! Let's see how good your memory is!
...Or, well, I WOULD interrupt if my Pokémon were still healthy.
We're no good at remembering patterns. We just wanted to make someone else feel the same!
... ... ... ... ... ...
And another interruption! How's your focus holding out?
...Or at least I'd try to interrupt if my Pokémon could still fight!
We're annoying, right? I know, I know... We're just doing our job, though.
You got past the glowing floor puzzles?! Well, you won't get any farther!
The boss of Team...what's-it-called is in this room! Of course, our boss is way more amazing!
You've got brains and Pokémon brawn! Let's see how far they'll get you!
I like our boss, obviously, but the man in here also seems really smart... I kind of like him!
It's confusing, right? I know how you feel!
Heh heh heh... You messed up! You should give up already!
You made a mistake, just as we'd planned!
I'm just a plain old Grunt, hangin' out here. Don't mind me! Go on, solve the puzzle!
Now's my chance! Check out my awesomely distracting pose!
Well, you solved the puzzle. Congrats, I guess. Man, do you think my pose needs more work?
The path is already open!
