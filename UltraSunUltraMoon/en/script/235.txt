Hey there!
You're still as fired up as ever, eh, "Royal"?
Ha! <var>, lemme introduce you. This is Molayne. He runs the observatory here and also manages PC Boxes, but he's not Hokulani's captain.
But I was the captain once, my masked friend.
It's <var>, right? Thanks for coming all the way up Hokulani to visit us. Our Captain Sophocles is a rather busy young man, I'm afraid. Always calculating comets' paths or updating that Festival Plaza thing of his...



If you want to be introduced to the Masked Royal, though... Well, that's something I could definitely help you with right here and now.
Yeah, I think she's even stronger than we were at this point of our island challenge!
One more thing, cousin—the name's Kukui! Who's this Masked Royal you're talking about?!
Just...think about that favor I asked you, yeah, Molayne? I want you to seriously consider it. I guess I should head back to Malie Garden. Even Hau should be done eating malasadas by now, yeah? I'll make sure he makes it up here, too.
That guy's as interesting as ever. My old buddy!
Here's a little something to remember our meeting by, <var>!
Behold!
Cutting sharpness! Unyielding power! Yes, this move has them both! And it is what you need to know to draw forth the Steel-type Z-Power. I gathered these Z-Crystals when I was on my own island challenge back in my own day, adventuring with Kukui and my Pokémon in search of strength. You should go ahead and use it now.
Now go on inside and tour our observatory as you like!
And if you're ready for the real trial, Captain Sophocles can be found in the head's office!
