I'm a real man of the seas and I consider it my duty to keep the beach safe! So here's my warning to you: the only people you'll find swimming in the water here are Pokémon Trainers! Be careful out there!
Here. Why don't you take this?
What? Would you rather have had the Soda Pop that I already started drinking?
Starchy here—oh, I mean Sandygast—really compresses and hardens when you give it some Fresh Water.
Come on, Stoutland! We'll get this beach pristine in no time...and a bag full of new treasures, too, once we find all the hidden items in the sand!

The only reason I can luxuriate like this now is thanks to the work I do here on this beach. If you're interested in some part-time work, why don't you try chucking some Pyukumuku?
