Dexio and Sina came to the Alola region in search of a Pok√©mon called Zygarde. If you manage to catch Zygarde in Alola, please come let us know.
The Zygarde Cube is a mysterious object in which you can store Zygarde's Cells and Cores. They are like cells. I heard that a professor called Sycamore in the Kalos region found it.
