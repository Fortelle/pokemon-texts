Waaaaaaah! Daddy! I want to know more about <var>!
Oh, ah...what shall I do? Is there someone with <var>?
Would you like to show your Pokémon to them?
Waaaaaaaah!
Thank you! But if it's possible, please show him a Pokémon, not an Egg!
Oh! Thank you very much! Look, Son! It's a Pokémon!
Waaaaah! Daddy! It's <var>! It doesn't look like <var> at all!
Hmmm... You're right. OK. Daddy will be <var> then.
Look. Ooh-ooh-ahh-ahh!
*sniffle* You're weird...
Oh! Thank you! Look, Son! It's <var>!
Wow! It's <var>! Yay, yay!
That was great, right?
Daddy! Why is this Pokémon called <var>?
Ah... Well... That's because... Long ago, some Passimian had a lot of Apicot Berries to share. One held out his hand, and the others said, "Pass him an Apicot." Somebody overheard "Pass him an" and figured that was their name, I guess.
Ah... Well...that's because... long, long ago, Oranguru knew a lot about Oran Berries, so people started calling the Pokémon an Oran...guru... Maybe...
Wow... Great! I get it!
Oh, thank you, mister. Please take this.
Oh, thank you, miss. Please take this.
When I grow up, I'm gonna be <var>!
I should learn more about Pokémon...
