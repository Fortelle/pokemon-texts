He-e-ey, <var>! Oh! And Lillie's with you, too!
What are you up to, Hau?
Just finished up my trial! Heh!
Hey, <var>! I wanna see if I really learned anything from my trial. Let me battle you again!
So you and me both beat that Totem Pokémon, huh, <var>? Looks like we're getting pretty strong! And I'm not stopping now. I'm gonna use this momentum to beat my old gramps, too!
Hey there, <var>! Knew I could count on you, yeah! Thanks for tracking Lillie down for me!
What's this then? Hau, you finished your first trial, too? I bet you used some stylin' moves, yeah?
Heh heh, yeah... All thanks to <var>!
Hala's probably rubbing his hands together in glee right about now, oh yeah!
What do you mean?
It's all a part of the trials, yeah? After you clear one island's trials, you gotta battle that island's kahuna!
Taking on the island kahuna in battle is called the grand trial! For someone like me who's researching Pokémon moves, nothing could be better than the chance to see some more fierce Pokémon battles! Woo!
I don't know about fierce...
I'll be the judge of that! Come on! Back to Iki Town! Catch that Tailwind and blast through Route 3!


It seems to me...that Trainers can always find a path to happiness as long as they have their Pokémon with them. It's a very nice way to live.
