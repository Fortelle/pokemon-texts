Hold on! You gotta battle with me!
You will battle me, right? I know you will! Right?
Yeah, and I won't lose!
Not now!
All right! This is gonna be great!
Very well, then! Let the Pokémon battle begin!
Hoo-ee! That gave me chicken skin! <var>, right? Your <var> was awesome!
Now that settles it! I'm going all out tomorrow!
Oh yeah! <var>! Hold up a sec!
What is it, Hau? Did you forget something?
You're seriously asking me that?! Who's the one here who forgot to tell anyone before wandering off for a little stroll and a sing without a word, huh?


Hm? <var>... Would you be so kind as to give me a look at that Sparkling Stone you have there?
Could it be?!
Tutu, isn't that...
You were rescued by Tapu Koko at the bridge— isn't that what I heard, <var>?
Yeah, it rescued me
That's when I got that stone
So it even deigned to give you a stone... Perhaps you are here in Alola, <var>, because this is where you are meant to be. Allow me to borrow this stone for now. Fret not! I'll return it to you tomorrow evening.
You have the makings of a brilliant Trainer. I can see that light within you, too. You must do us the honor of joining in our festival tomorrow!
First I'll make sure you get back home safe today, though, <var>. Lillie, you two should come with us, too, yeah. Wouldn't want to go losing you twice in one day. You or that precious Pokémon of yours!
Yes... I will keep an eye on...
Pew!
Oh, you! Would you not try to escape the very moment that you were told not to wander off!
