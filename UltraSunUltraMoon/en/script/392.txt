<var>! Hold up for me!
So after we split up at Aether Paradise, I went and cleared all the rest of my trials, and then I even went back home to train with Ilima a bit.
I was just thinking it was time to take on the Pokémon League... Then I heard from Gladion that you were already heading here, <var>! So I booked it here as fast as I could!
That was, like, the fastest I've ever moved in my life, you know!
But that's not what I came here to tell you!
<var>! We're gonna decide which one of us'll be the first to the Pokémon League! You're gonna need to use your full force if you think you're gonna beat me and my team when we're serious about winning!
Ooooh, and I really wanted my Pokémon to know how it feels to beat your team this time! But being seriously frustrated will only make me stronger!
So you'd better go and become Champion. 'Cause I'm gonna train so that next time I can come beat Champion <var>! Good luck, cuz, and here!
I'm really glad that the kid who moved here to Alola turned out to be you, <var>!
