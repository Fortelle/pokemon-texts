Oh yeah, now you're the Pokémon League Champion!
Wouldn't it be nice if it was that simple? The truth is, there's one more person you have to battle if you want that title.
And of course that Trainer is me. Woo!
Just kidding!
It's me!
You know what? Something kinda hit me after I finally beat my old gramps in an all-out serious battle.
You're kinda my hero, <var>! You and your team are, I mean!
And because I really look up to you... I really wanna have a serious battle against you! I really want to be able to win against you! 'Cause it's way more fun when Pokémon and their Trainers are all friends and get along. Then they can do something really amazing!
One final hurrah for your island challenge. And a special tribute as you and this Pokémon League embark on a new path! Let's have a battle worthy of this moment!
We managed to pull off something pretty amazing, when my partners and I were all in sync and wanting the same thing. But looks like we're still one step away from being the strongest Trainer and team! But you know what's funny? Even though we lost, that was more exciting than any other battle I've ever had till now! Everything's all mixed up inside me—it was so fun and so frustrating, and just... Yup! It was just awesome, really!
Amazing! You and Hau are both amazing, <var>! It's like I told you before, the strongest moves you can use are the ones a Trainer and their Pokémon choose together in the heat of the moment—when it really counts. And you just proved me right! Congrats, cousin. You're a Champion we can all be proud of.
I told you, didn't I? Up there on Mount Hokulani.
Man, the Pokémon and the Trainers in Alola really are the best! I want everyone in the world to know that, too! That's always been my dream!
And right here, right now, it finally came true! And it's all thanks to you, <var>! You and your <var>!
