You were out like a light, weren't you? You ought to be full of energy by now!
And just look! It's already daytime here! It's completely the opposite of Kanto. But then we are so far away here in Alola.
And just look! It's already night here! It's completely the opposite of Kanto. But then we are so far away here in Alola.
So, <var>! Are you excited to meet some Alolan Pokémon?
Of course!
I guess...
Yeah, I am!
I don't know...
That's right! I want to hurry up and meet some, too!
Oh, you! Someday you're going to learn to have a little wonder in your life!
We're living in the Alola region now! The beautiful islands everyone wants to visit! I'm sure the Pokémon living in a place like this must be friendly, right?
It might not be a bad idea to go out and see for yourself just how friendly Pokémon here are.
Right, <var>? Go and get ready for a bit of exploring! Your Bag and hat and things should be hanging on your coat stand in your room. And didn't you leave your copy of Adventure Rules on your desk, too?

Mrowr?
