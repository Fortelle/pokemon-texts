I'm a dedicated Hall-of-Famer fan! Just an old fellow who loves nothing so much as watching folks battle to become Champion! I remember the team of every Trainer who has tried to enter the Hall of Fame. Including you! I can remind you of who you had on your team when you won if you'd like.
Then let this Hall-of-Famer fan remind you which of your Pok√©mon partners helped you reach the lofty position of Champion!
