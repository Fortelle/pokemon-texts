Welcome to the Pokémon Fan Club! This is where people from around the world gather to show off their photos of their most beloved Pokémon!
My favorite has got to be the lovely Meowth to my left!
Mreh heh.
It's SO cute and lovely and smart, it's almost too much to take! Oh! Sorry! Once I start bragging, oh, how the time does get away from me! Ahem! Now, as I was saying...
Are you taking photos of your favorite Pokémon for them? The more photos you take of your Pokémon at the Alola Photo Club, the more affectionate they become toward you! In fact, I can see how affectionate your Pokémon are feeling toward you. Mm-hmm...
Impossible! Y-your <var> is just as affectionate toward you as Meowth is toward me! If you love your Pokémon that much then I must name you a member of the Pokémon Fan Club! Which means that I should also give you access to our exclusive heart-themed background, which only our members can use for photos! You should head off to an Alola Photo Club at once to snap some shots with your Pokémon!
Ahhh, but your Pokémon could still be more affectionate toward you than it is now. Become true friends with that Pokémon, and I'll recognize you as a proper Pokémon Fan!
W-would you like to hear about how wonderful my Meowth is?
Oh! You see, my favorite Meowth here is the cutest! It's SO cute and lovely and smart, it's almost too much to take! Plus, it's really just amazing when you stop to look at it. Don't you think so? Oh yes. Its looks are so stunning and its heart so kindly, you can't help but love it! And when you hug it tight when it's sleeping, it's so warm and cuddly... Plus, it looks spectacular when you pose together with it in photos, of course. Oh, and it's simply ravishing when...
...Oops! Look at the time! I kept you too long!
Oh... What a shame...
Ho! You're not only a Champion in battle but even an ace at loving your Pokémon! But I won't be outdone when it comes to loving Pokémon the most. I'm the true Champion there!
