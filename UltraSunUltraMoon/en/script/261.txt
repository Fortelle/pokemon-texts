Greetings, trial-goer! I'm afraid this is a captain's barricade. Only those who pass the Ghost-type trial can come through here.
Ho! That's Ghostium Z right there! Then let me just get this thing out of the way for you! One second...
Beyond this gate stretches the great expanse of Haina Desert. It's a bit different every day, due to the wind... Or maybe it's the snorting breath of Tapu Bulu!
Oh, hey! Um, if you've got one to spare... think you could front me a Fresh Water?
Oh! Thanks, friend! Here, let me give you these in return. They're Adrenaline Orbs. Don't you feel like the Pokémon that other Pokémon call to help them in battle are, like, stronger? And even more likely to be Shiny?
My partner is a Poliwhirl with the Water Absorb Ability, so it loves a little dousing now and then.
Well, thanks for wanting to help! But it looks like you don't have a Fresh Water. If you remember me, hopefully you can bring me one next time you're passing through here!
I get it! Your Fresh Waters are precious to you. But if you remember me, maybe you can bring an extra for me next time!
Po...
Whirrrrrrlll!!!
