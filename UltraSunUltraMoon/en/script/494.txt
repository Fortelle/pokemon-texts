Hey, howzit! You feel like taking a little trip across the waves with Mantine? This is the <var> Surf Spot. Just tell me what I can help you with. 
What's that board there?
Teach me how to surf!
Nothing, thanks
That board over there is what we call a ranking board. That's where you can see the highest-ranked surfers at each Surf Spot. You ought to go riding the waves with Mantine, too, and see if you can nab that No. 1 spot!
We've got some great waves again today, here in Alola. You should definitely jump on Mantine there and try to get a real high score!
Huh? You can't mean that you seriously forgot how to surf on Mantine?! OK, little friend. Don't you worry. I've got you covered! It does take a little while to cover all the basics, though, so you sure you're ready to start now?
Then here we go!
I'd be happy to share my little lesson with you anytime, so come back whenever you're free!
You know, I bet you could probably even master this move now...
You learned the aerial move Lanturn 360!
You learned the aerial move Primarina Twist!
You learned the aerial move Starmie 720!
Pull off a Lanturn 360 when the waves are high, and you can try to nab an even higher score than you'd get with other moves!
Pulling off a Primarina Twist when the waves are pretty low will net you more points than using other moves would do.
The Starmie 720 is a real cool move that you can use on any kind of wave to try to rack up some big points!
Use that new move and master the waves, little cousin!
Tell me about moves
Gorebyss Spiral
Huntail Spiral
Lanturn 360
Primarina Twist
Starmie 720
Over-the-Gyarados
Magikarp Splash
Never mind
Which move do you want to learn about?
The Gorebyss Spiral is a great move to try out while you're in the air anyway. Try it out once, when you're pulling other tricks!
The Huntail Spiral is a great move to try out while you're in the air anyway. Try it out once, when you're pulling other tricks!
The Over-the-Gyarados is a killer move that boosts your score from the last jump you pulled off, too! But if you use it twice, then your score doesn't go up anymoreâ€”it goes down!
The Magikarp Splash is a move that you can pull off when you fail to pull off any other moves. Crazy, right? Try to get a real high score by using it just once. That's the trick!
You've dominated every single surfing course! You should definitely swing by the local branch of the Surf Association. It's in Heahea City.
Eeeh! Eeeh!
