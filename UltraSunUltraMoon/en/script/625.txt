Off in the faraway Johto region, see, there is this amazing craftsman who smiths Poké Balls from special Berries.
What, really? You mean they don't all come from the factory in Kalos?
Hey, you! You Trainer, there! Will you listen to this?
Ho ho ho! I'm sorry to just spring this on you, but do you know of the rare GS Ball?
Of course!
GS Ball?
Oh! So you already know of Kurt, the masterful Poké Ball smith who is the pride of the Johto region!
Yes, the GS Ball... It is indeed the greatest smith's ball. That is what we call the GS Ball.
That's the greatest!
Is that true?
Well...there are also those who might call it the Gold-Silver Ball, but...
So which one is right?!
Truth is in the eye of the beholder, my boy.
Young Trainer, I'm sorry that we delayed you on your journey. Let me share something great with you to make up for it.
It's a Premier Ball, crafted to commemorate a special occasion of some sort!
I once tried to throw a Master Ball at another Trainer's Pokémon. It was blocked and rebounded away, with the strict warning not to act like a thief...
If you're buying Poké Balls at a Poké Mart, you should buy them in sets of 10!
