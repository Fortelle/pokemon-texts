Hello. I'm Lana. I serve as the captain of Brooklet Hill.
So, trial-goer... Will you be attempting my trial?
Definitely!
Not yet
Oh, really? I will be waiting, in that case.
Then I will explain the trial to you.
My particular trial is this... I want you to herd the Pokémon found in the pools of Brooklet Hill, driving them downstream to draw out the Totem Pokémon. If I might be so blunt, they are Wishiwashi. It's Wishiwashi I want you to herd.
But I won't expect you to swim through all the pools yourself. I have a lovely gift to help you.
Lapras was registered to your Ride Pager!
If you climb atop Lapras there, you will be able to travel over bodies of water. Now you'll be able to help drive those Pokémon downstream for me!
So if you're ready... Please follow me this way.
