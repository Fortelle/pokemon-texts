My bro is super strong at Pokémon, you know!
I borrowed my bro's Pokémon. Without asking, actually, but do you want to have a battle?!
Huh! Scared of losing, I bet!
Heh! I'll beat you, no sweat!
What? Why?! My bro's Pokémon is super strong. Why did I lose?!
Hey, you!
Oh no! H-hey, Big Bro...
You brought my Pokémon out again without asking, didn't you?!
I-I'm sorry...
And it looks like you got soundly defeated, too.
Yeah... But all your Pokémon are super strong, Big Bro... I don't get why...?
Even if they have potential, if you don't let them fight properly, Pokémon can't unleash their full power!
You can only understand how strong your Pokémon are by giving them love and attention on a daily basis.
If you want to win with borrowed Pokémon, you need to train yourself, too!
... ... ... ... ... ...
I always blamed my Pokémon when I'd lose against friends...
but that's what's been preventing me from really becoming strong...
I'm going to spend more time with my own Pokémon! And I promise I'll beat you together with them, Bro!
Hah! I won't let you win easily!
Sorry you had to get tangled up in this weird situation. Take this for your troubles!
Right, I'll race you back home!
Yeah! I'll see you 'round!
