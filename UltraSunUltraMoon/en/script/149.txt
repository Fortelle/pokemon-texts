See? Do you see that there?
Look at that vigorous splashing! I wouldn't be surprised to find a fearsome Pok√©mon is the one causing it all...
So, brave trial-goer, I would like to ask you to investigate that splashing there and find out what exactly is causing it. I won't ask you to swim out there, of course. I have a lovely gift for you instead.
Lapras was registered to your Ride Pager!
If you climb atop Lapras there, you will be able to travel over bodies of water. That's right. You'll even be able to reach those splashes and see what is going on there.
