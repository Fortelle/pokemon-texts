There's a bottle with a letter and a Heart Scale in it... Do you want to open it?
To the boy or girl who is reading this, Please take this letter and give it to the person who loves dancing and Corsola who lives on Akala Island.
She should be singing the song she wrote together with Corsola. I bet she is. If you give this letter to her, I promise good things will happen to you, too! Thank you so much!
Welcome! Can I help you?
You tell her about the letter and Heart Scale you found.
Oh wow! You really found this?! Oh, I can't believe it!
... ... ... ... ... ...
Oh, I'm so sorry! I got a little excited... You see, there was this rumor that was really popular back when I was a child. If you write a letter to your future self and throw it into the ocean along with your treasure, it was said your dream would come true. So, that's what I did!
This letter was delivered to me because my dream has come true... I still can't believe it!
Thank you so much for bringing this to me. Here, you can keep the Heart Scale. I hope good fortune smiles on you, too!
Do you want to read the letter in the bottle one more time?
