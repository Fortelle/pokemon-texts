Stufful looks lonely and sad.
*groan*
W-w-water...
Would you like to give the man a Fresh Water?
*groan*
You don't have a Fresh Water!
You gave the man a Fresh Water!
Oh, thank you! *gulp gulp gulp*
Delicious! The water flowed into every cell in my body! Thank you. I've been revived! I was so thirsty I couldn't walk!
Ffful!
Oh! It's my Stufful!
Ffful, ffful.
I see. You got worried because I didn't come back, so you came here to look for me.
This little one must have followed you when you opened the door.
Ffful!
Thank you! Thank you for the Fresh Water, too!
OK. Let's go back to the motel.
Oh! You're the one who gave me a Fresh Water! You're my savior.
You really saved me there! This time, I've got plenty of Fresh Water. I bought a lot. So I'll give you some!

I learned a hard lesson. Neither humans nor Pokémon can live without water.
Ffful. ♪
I've heard that the Trainer of the Pokémon that was in the guest room came back.
I'm so glad that the adorable Pokémon didn't end up alone.
