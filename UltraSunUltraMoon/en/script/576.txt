Oh, Magnemite! Not again! How many times do I have to tell you?! If you suck up all the electricity at once, we lose power and the whole place goes dark!
Bzzzrt?!
Sorry... I hope you weren't frightened just now. That Magnemite is actually my Pokémon. I'm really sorry if it gave you a shock. I'll give you this scintillating TM since I'm sorry.
