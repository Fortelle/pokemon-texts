Hey there, <var>! Go see what you can learn from everybody!
How about that, <var>? If Ultra Beasts are really out there, I wonder what kinds of moves they can use...
You've finished all three of Akala's trials. Woo! And now comes the big match against Olivia— the island kahuna! It's the biggest and baddest trial of them all here on Akala—the grand trial!
Good luck! Olivia's house is past Diglett's Tunnel. It's in Konikoni City!
I still have some things I want to talk to Professor Burnet about, so I'll stay here.
Being able to go to more places really makes it feel like you're growing along with your partner Pokémon, huh? It's pretty great!
