I can tell how many times you've had opposing Pokémon call for help during battle! If I use a mysterious machine that an enigmatic man gave to me, that is.
I can tell your opposing wild Pokémon have called for help <var> times!
Your opposing Pokémon have called for help countless times!
Wild Pokémon... They call for help when they're backed into a corner—for example, when their HP goes down.
But a Pokémon with a status condition—such as being poisoned, paralyzed, or asleep—won't call for help...
Just between you and me... there may be some Pokémon that you'll never encounter unless they are called on for help!
Here, take these Adrenaline Orbs!
Using an Adrenaline Orb makes wild Pokémon more likely to call for help.
Your opposing Pokémon have called for help countless times! You must be a great Pokémon Trainer!
