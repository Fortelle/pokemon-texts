Phew... Look, <var>! Seems like we're almost to the Aether House, where the captain is supposed to be, huh?
So that way lies Mount Lanakila, huh? I guess they're really making a Pokémon League up there on the peak...
The professor told me that Pokémon Leagues in other regions have four crazy-strong Trainers in them that they call the Elite Four!
The Elite Four and our island kahunas... I wonder which ones are stronger! I'm pretty sure my gramps is the strongest, but I can't wait to find out for sure!
