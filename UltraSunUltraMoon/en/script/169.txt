It's a Revival Herb! You put the Revival Herb in your Forage Bag!
It's a Revival Herb! Wait... No, it's not! On second glance, it's just a normal weed!
A Pokémon leaped out of the grass to attack!
Hey, it's me, Mallow! That's a fine Revival Herb!

Ooh, looks like you got everything! OK, it's time for us to start cooking, so come on back to the entrance of the jungle!

Still two more ingredients left to get! Just a little more to find!
Still three ingredients left to get! We still need a whole big helping!
