Walking across Ula'ula Island really makes you feel how big it is, doesn't it?
Well, <var>. Good luck with Mina's trial.
Oh, it's you...
Look, kid... About what happened with Necrozma... I guess I should... Thanks. I'm saying thanks. OK?
Hey! If it isn't <var> and Guzma! What're the two of you doing together?
The kahuna's grandson, huh... We're not doin' nothin'.
Oh yeah! I've got something I wanted to ask you, Guzma! That Golisopod you've got, yeah...
Huh? This dude? Yeah, he's been with me since before I started out on my island challenge. My partner.
There ain't nobody in Team Skull who can beat my Golisopod. The rest of my team, too. I met them all during my island challenge and trained 'em up as good as anything. ...Not that any of that matters now.
So you got to meet your Pokémon partners by doing the island challenge and made some really great friends, too, huh?
Friends?
He did?
You know! Everybody in Team Skull! They all really love Guzma after all, right?
You'll meet Pokémon and people on your journey that'll enrich your life. Is that it? ...Geez. You really are old Hala's grandson...
Who knows? Maybe kids like you can make the island challenge actually mean something again.
Here. I don't need this anymore.
Ho... Here it comes again. The winds of Alola are blowing again, bringing some new change.
Just you wait, Guzma! I'm gonna outdo even the kahunas! And I'm gonna make sure everybody knows they can be something great, whether they choose to do the island challenge or not!
You didn't fail to become a captain, Guzma! No matter what you might think! So go become something else—something that nobody else has ever managed to be!
<var>! Consider this one last warning! I told you before, but once we both finish up our island challenges, we're gonna have a serious battle—you and me!
