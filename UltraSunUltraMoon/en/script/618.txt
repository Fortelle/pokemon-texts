I'd really love to see an unbelievable Mantine Surfer, skilled enough to take the top-ranked spot in every one of Alola's four Surf Spots!
I've heard about you, kid. You're the one who took the top-ranked spot in all four of Alola's Surf Spots... Congratulations! They call me the Boss... I'm also a surfer beloved by the Mantine and the sea itself, but not as much as you!
I've got the perfect Pokémon for you... I'll give you a Pikachu that knows Surf! I hope you'll make it one of your partners!
Ack! You can't take another Pokémon now? Come back when you've got space for one.
Oooh, I know! And I'll teach you a trick I used to always use! Spin in each different direction in turn, and see what happens. Try that, and beat your own best record, kid. That's what I'd like to see you do now. Me and this Pikachu that knows Fly will be cheering for you when you do!
Bigachuuu!
