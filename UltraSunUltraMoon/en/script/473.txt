So, <var>! Did you begin the trial?
Uh... Big Mo...
Oops, that's right... Sorry, Soffy. The Charjabug are still outside.
You see, Charjabug create electricity as they digest their food.
They are outside with their food now, but we kinda need them to start the trial.
Right! <var> and I will go and gather up the Charjabug.
I'll be waiting for you outside, <var>!
I really like watching the Charjabug burrow underground for food. I think they're really cute.
I'm gonna run a few more checks on the Roller and the Pinger.
