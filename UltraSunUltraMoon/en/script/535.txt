Welcome to... ... ... I'm sorry, but... are you <var>?
I am
You know me?
I thought you must be.
From my son.
Guzma has actually come home a few times since...all that. And he told me to give you this if you ever came by.
It was always one of his favorite TMs. He won so many trophies when he entered battle competitions with the Pok√©mon that he'd taught to use Swagger.
I know that there were a lot of rumors flying around, saying that our Guzma was up to no good and doing terrible things... but I know it was all just lies.
