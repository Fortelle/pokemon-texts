I wonder if we'll get to meet again tonight... Oh, I can't wait until the sun goes down!
Alola! It's such a beautiful night, isn't it? Would you like to see something fantastic?
Sure, I'm not here to force anybody.
Then come this way... It's better if you crouch down, too.
...See that?
What do you think that is?
The correct answer is that it's the light of the Wing Fish Pok√©mon, Finneon!
They store up light from the sun during the day, then let their tail fin patterns all glow at night!
If you want to see them again ever, feel free to stop by. I can make any night a special night.
Are you here because you wanted to see the light of the Finneon again?
They just glow like this, night after night, whether anyone is here to see it or not.
Seeing that pure dedication makes me feel like maybe I should try a little harder, too.
