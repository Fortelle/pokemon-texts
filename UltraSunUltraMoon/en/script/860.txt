There are ideas for video games written down! Maybe you should add a few touches?
There are tons of game-development documents packing the shelves!
There's a book written all about something called a Battle Pyramid...
There are all kinds of magazines on the shelves. I wonder who collects them all?
It's a refrigerator absolutely packed with sweets and treats! And extra-sweet treats!
