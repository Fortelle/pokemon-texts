Over here!
Mount Hokulani is the second tallest mountain in Alola. And the tallest...

It's a sacred spot, yeah, the closest you can ever get to the Legendary Pokémon of Alola, said to be the sun incarnate.
It's a sacred spot, yeah, the closest you can ever get to the Legendary Pokémon of Alola, said to be the moon incarnate.
That's it! Right there! On the peak of Lanakila! That's where I'll establish our Pokémon League!
We'll get everybody who's finished their island challenges, yeah, and up there on the peak of Mount Lanakila, they'll battle against the kahunas to become the island challenge champion! I've always valued our old traditions here in Alola, but it's time to make a Champion the whole world will recognize! It's time to get our own Elite Four and make our own Pokémon League!
To think that, someday, the kiddos in Alola will be able to go from being the island challenge champion to the world Champion! And then, when we have our own Champion, they can show the rest of the world what's so special about Alolan Pokémon and their Trainers, yeah!
I can't wait to see what kind of Totem Pokémon will show up next!
