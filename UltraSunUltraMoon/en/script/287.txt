Uncle Nanu!
And here comes the noise again...
Kew!
Aue! I'm so sorry... You must've been so scared, huh?
Thanks, <var>! Really! You're really something!
Uncle, you're a great police officer, aren't you? I really hope that you're keeping a good eye on things here! What else do you stay here for, if you're not putting a stop to Team Skull's shenanigans?
The rent's real cheap. No one else is crazy enough to stay this close to Team Skull, after all.
That's what you say. But it's really all for the Pokémon, isn't it? You could depend on the Aether Foundation to look after the Pokémon that Team Skull hurts, but you stay here to look out for them, huh?
Come on, Yungoos. Let's get you back to Aether House!
Kew!
I'll come back to see you again soon, Uncle!
No one's asking you to...
Come on, <var>. Aren't you coming back to Aether House, too?
Alola!
Then come by Aether House when you're done! Alola!
Pokémon tucked up in their Poké Balls, Team Skull locked up in their little town... I wonder if either enjoys the experience?
