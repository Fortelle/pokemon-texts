There is a tattered diary.
Would you like to read it?
March 2 Moved into a new house. It's a very spacious house. The rent is cheap. Wonderful. What a great deal! I'm so lucky!
I look forward to every day here! But I sometimes hear a cracking sound in the middle of the night. I wonder what it is...
*crack crack*
You hear a sound from somewhere.
You decide to read the next entry in the diary.
March 9 This room is weird. Even when I'm alone, I sometimes seem to see something moving out of the corner of my eye.
I thought I was imagining it, but I always feel like someone is watching me... Who could be watching me...?
*rustle*
Did something cross the room just now...?
You decide to read another entry in the diary.
March 11 This room is cursed! The sound of something scratching the floor doesn't seem to stop!
Scratching...scratching...scratching... Scratching...scratching...scratching... Scratching...scratching...scratching... Scratching...scratching...scratching...
Scratching...scratching...scratching... Scratching...scratching...scratching... Scratching...scratching...scratching... Scratching...scratching...scratching...
The light turned off by itself! The place went pitch-black!
*crack crack* *scratch scratch*
You hear something being scratched...
*scratch scratch scratch scratch* *scratch scratch scratch scratch* *scratch scratch scratch scratch* *scratch scratch scratch scratch*
What would you like to do?
Cover your ears
Run away
Flooo!
That's as far as I've gotten in my manuscript so far, but I think writing a horror novel in this kind of diary format could be a smash hit!

It seems like Drifloon was using the content of that "diary" to play a prank on people...
