Oh? Oh, hey, hey, hey! You're that trial-goer!
I managed to meet a marvelously maned mate of my own after our last meeting! And it's all thanks to you, so thank you!
But, you know, if I were being completely honest, I do have one other teeny tiny problem...
My bemaned beauty just doesn't seem to be very affectionate toward me. I've tried giving it Poké Beans and petting it plenty, but what am I doing wrong?
Dugtrio seems to be staring at your hair...
... ... ... ... ... ...
Deh...
¡Mira! You see that? It's gone all stroppy, and I don't know why!
I wonder why that would be... Could it be something about your looks, maybe?
Now that I think about it... There are these rare occasions when my luscious-locked lovely acts really affectionate toward certain customers...
Dug! Dug dug dug!
Dugtrio is wriggling furiously for some reason!
Dug-dug-dug-dug-dug!!!
Dugtrio just won't stop!
Calm down, Dugtrio!
Is it OK?!
What got into it all of a sudden?!
Oh! B-but...could it really be? Yes, that has to be it! My precious pretty has got to be...
It's undeniable! My baby is helplessly attracted to beautiful honey blond hair like yours?!
So the reason it wasn't very affectionate to me was simply that it likes blonds! Maybe it's time I changed my look anyway...
Hon...
I'm sorry I've caused you so much trouble. Here, take this—it's my favorite product!
