An Alola to you, <var>!
It is the custom of your people to have your Pokémon do battle if your goals are in conflict with those of another, isn't it? That is what we have learned during the course of our research.
I may not be well practiced in Pokémon battle, but I will make you leave Cosmog to us. Show himer your power, Poipole!
Even with all our technology, we cannot control the outcome of battle. This must be why we are unable to maintain perfect control over Necrozma...
You people here in Alola really are something, being able to make your Pokémon battle and all!
But...
Do not fear, Zossie.
We can rely upon the strength of the Aether Foundation.
We will use Cosmog and send formidable Pokémon Trainers through the Ultra Wormhole to battle and defeat Necrozma!
That is why we had the scientist Colress create a device that will be able to restrain Necrozma!
The president is going to help us.
Please don't get in our way...
