Welcome!
Nice to see a new face around here!
Oh my goodness!
I-I'm sorry. Who are you?
I'm Mina. I'm the local captain.
Me? I'm the chief of the seafolk. It's my job to keep everybody together.
Captain...Mina? It's nice to meet you then...
So let's get right down to things. Which one of you is here for my trial?
Yes, ma'am! What'd you think all these boats 'round you are here for?
We seafolk have spent years navigating the seas and searching out new wonders. When we find rare things, we bring 'em here to Alola to trade.
The ports on the other islands are busier these days, but we still always seem to end up back here on Poni, eh?
What did you all come here for? You collecting Berries, like us? 
Oh! No, that's not why we're here!
I mean, you're not entirely wrong. It's true that <var> is in the middle of hiser island challenge, but...
we're here to meet the kahuna of this island!
The kahuna? Oh... Well, that's a problem. Maybe you should talk to Hapu?
Hmm... Lillie seems like the type that's hard to really capture in a drawing, know what I mean?
The kahuna? Hmm. Maybe you should go to little Hapu's place? Her house is the only one still standing on Poni, after all. Where else would you go, eh?
You can recognize little Hapu's house at a glance...thanks to that huge Mudsdale of hers.
Oh! So Hapu lives here on Poni Island? Thank you very much, Captain Mina!
Let's go, <var>! It will be good to see Hapu and Mudsdale again!
M-modeling, is it? Does that mean I'm not allowed to move even an inch until you return from Exeggutor Island? I hope you'll hurry back, <var>...
Lipper!
