Why, hello, Champion! Alola to you!
I've got an idea! Since you've taken the trouble to come visit old Hala, could I ask you to help an old Trainer brush up his moves?
I'd be happy to!
I'm sort of busy...
In that case... Well, stay as long as you wish!
In that case... We must go to a location befitting the Champion of Alola!
Now... I'll hold nothing back! It's time you remembered what I can really do! Old Hala is here to make you holler!
To see one I sent out on the island challenge return with so much strength and energy... Could anything be more fulfilling than to feel it firsthand along with my awesome Pok√©mon?



That should help you get stronger, my boygirl!
You should show Tapu Koko what you learned during the island challenge, <var>.
Our guardians can be fickle and seem to toy with us, but perhaps that is only to make us think about whether or not our long-accepted rules and traditions are right.
