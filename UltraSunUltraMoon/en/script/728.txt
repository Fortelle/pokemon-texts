<var>...
I...I've been wanting to thank you for saving Nebby that day.
La-lio!
Mahina-pe!
Nebby... You came here from very far away, didn't you? I'm glad that I could take you with me... that we got to experience that journey together.
<var>, I know this may be sudden, but I hope you will consider what I ask of you. I want to entrust Nebby to you. I think Nebby should be with Necrozma. From what I've heard, Necrozma would not suffer as much or ache so for the light if it can remain close to Nebby...
And I think it'd be best...if they both stayed together with you, <var>. I've thought a lot about it and that's what I decided, so...please... I want you to face Nebby as only a Trainer can. And I want you to give it a ball to call home.
La-liona-a-ahhh!!!
Mahina-a-ahhh!!!

Lunala... No... Nebby. Nebby, you belong with <var> now. HShe will be the one to raise you. Just like any parent should raise their child. HShe will be your famother now.
Nebby... You have brought your light to everyone. And...
I know that you will be able to keep everyone smiling and happy, <var>. Thank you for taking care of Nebby for me. 
Nebby... I'm going to become stronger. I swear I will! Now it will be your turn to watch over me as I grow, OK? Please watch me...
And this, <var>... Nebby was holding it. Please use it with care.
Now let's go, <var>!
