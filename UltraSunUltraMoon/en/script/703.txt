Hey there, the rain's really coming down! You'll catch a cold, wandering around like that!
Why not come over here? This is the perfect spot to sit out this downpour.
Ah, the rain of Alola! Comes and goes as it pleases, just like the guardian deities, eh?
Same as you, come to think of it. Always running off to this island, that island...
I was like that back in the day, too, y'know? Now, I only got time for what I like to do, though.
Ah, but then you might like running around the islands! Just doing what you like, too, eh?
Ah...
Well, looks like the rain's let up! I'll head on back to my boat.
