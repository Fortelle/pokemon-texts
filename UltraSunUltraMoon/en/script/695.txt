Hi, <var>. What a coincidence!
The Machamp I call upon as a Ride Pok√©mon really loves training, so we sometimes come here together.
Yah!
Great! That is the right amount of load for the muscle!
Mmmmmm!!
Lifting a heavy object! That is, the change in potential energy! The science you can learn from the muscles is inspiring!
Yeah. I should train sometimes, too.
Hm! Hm! Hm! Hm!
*sigh* Of course, Machamp is stronger than me. Well, let's call it a day.
The Masked Royal is really great. He could lift me quite easily.
Yah!
Are you satisfied?
All right. See you again!
