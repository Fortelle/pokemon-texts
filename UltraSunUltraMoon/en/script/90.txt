Oh. <var>... Tell me, do you pick out all your own clothes?
Of course I do
My mom does it
Of course... Most people do, don't they...
Oh, your mother must have a great sense of style then. I love the way that you dress.
I...I've always just worn the clothes that my mother wanted me to wear. I don't really know what kind of thing would suit me...
Oh! But that's not why I stopped you. I meant to give you thisese, <var>. I received itthem inside the apparel shop here.
I didn't even buy anything, but they said I was the 99,999th customer to visit the store... But I already have the same oneset, so I thought that maybe you might...want itthem?
It looks like we have something in common now, don't we, <var>? Hee...
