Oh... I'm sorry. They said this here was an antique, so I nearly delivered it to the wrong place...
You are <var>, right? I have a Pokémon here for you.
Why don't you make some space in your party or Boxes, and then come back to see me again?
Thank you very much! Now if you'll excuse me...
That's a Pokémon that people like me refer to as a Mythical Pokémon. It is a real treasure, more precious than you know. It was made hundreds of years ago!
