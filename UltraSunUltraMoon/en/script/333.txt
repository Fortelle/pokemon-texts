I've read about them, you know... Alola's sacred ruins...and the guardian deities worshipped within them. They go wherever they want, so it's not easy to meet them...according to the books I've read. But if they are summoned here at the ruins, they do sometimes appear.
The books say that they are, well, capricious. Encounters with them do not always end as you hope they will. Maybe that explains why... even coming here to these ruins hasn't evoked any response from Nebby...
Oh! There's Hapu!
