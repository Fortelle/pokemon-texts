It's filled with cold water.
*kerplunk*
Oops! You dropped a Protein in the water!
Ouch! This hit me while I was cleaning the pond. Is it you who dropped this Protein?
Yes, sorry—it was me
I don't know what you mean
Be careful next time.
The man gave you back your Protein.
I'll give you an Iron as a reward for being an honest kid.
See you!
Hmmm... If you don't know, I'll keep this Protein. It's OK, right?
*gulp gulp*
Aahhhhhhhhh!
Drinking Protein makes me too energetic! Uh-oh! Gaaaaah! Woooooo!
Baaaaaaaaaaah!
Hahaha! I'm just messing with you. I'm sorry to surprise you.
The man gave you back your Protein.
Don't take Protein! Give it to your Pokémon! See you!
