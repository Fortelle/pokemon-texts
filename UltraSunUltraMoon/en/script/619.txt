Seeing the vending machine makes me think... do you think a Rotom ever tried going in there?
The vending machine seems to be out of order.
I wonder when they're ever going to fix this... It's way more convenient to be able to use the vending machine anytime you want to.
Oh, you have a Z-Power Ring... Maybe you could fix the vending machine? Ha ha, that's so stupid, right? I know that the two have nothing to do with each other.
Wait...is that one of those rare Rotom Dexes? Does it have the Pokémon Rotom inside it?
You called, zzt...?
You called, zzt...?
You called, so I'm here, zzt!
You called, so I'm here, zzt!
It does! Hey, hey! Do you think you could ask Rotom to help?
You think he can fix it?
You think he can go in there?
Sure I can! Zz-zzt!
Sure I can! Zz-zzt!
Who d'you think you're talking about, zzrt?!
Who d'you think you're talking about, zzrt?!
Rotom zipped into the vending machine faster than your eyes could even follow!
Zzt zzt...
Oh? Interesting. Seems like it doesn't actually change forms when it's in a vending machine?
You know a lot about Rotom, huh?
Yeah, looks like it
Oh, you see... I was actually a bit involved in making the parts for the Poké Finder's zoom function.
All done, zzt!
Oh! Looks like it's done. Do you think it worked? Do you think Rotom fixed it?
I'll press the button for a Fresh Water, and...
Oh? Hmm. It's not cold.
But it's still all thanks to Rotom! So here, you take it!
But this experience really makes me think that Rotom hold far greater potential than we ever dreamed of before... Almost limitless potential! It's already become a Pokédex here in Alola. I wonder what it might zip right into next? Maybe a PC Box? Hah!
Come on. Please? Won't you give your Rotom a tap and call it out?
