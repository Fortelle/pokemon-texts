Hey! No one told you guys to stop!
What, you ain't heard, yo? Our old Team Skull is done-zo. We got nothing to do now. Nope, nothin', no. So we're training up so that we'll be tough enough to help out anyone in need of rescue... Then you can call us Team Reskull!
The kahuna grabbed us by the scruff of our necks and dragged us here, saying we got nothing better to do anyway, right? Like, OK, Pok√©mon battles are one thing... But Alola-style sumo? Come on!
See, <var>? Helping people like this is just another way I train myself to get stronger!
