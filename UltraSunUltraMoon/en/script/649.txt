You can feel a pair of eyes on you...
Keh heh heh heh heh...
Mimikyu?
Pikachu?
Everything went dark!
*tap* ... *tap tap tap* ... *hshhh* ... *hshhh* ...
You can hear footsteps in the dark...
Mi! Mi!
Mimikyu is staring steadily your way...
Try picking it up
Try looking under its cloth
Miii!
Mimikyu nuzzled up against you...
Kyu!
Pikachu and Mimikyu are staring steadily your way...
Keh heh heh...
Kyu-u-urses!
Kyu!
Mimikyu disappeared somewhere...
A piece of Mimikium Z, the exclusive Z-Crystal just for Mimikyu, is lying on the floor!
Oh? What're you doing back here, <var>?
Hey, is that Mimikium Z?!
Wow! I've never actually seen a piece before!
It's really, really rare, you know?
How did you manage to get a piece?!
You explain what happened with Mimikyu...
Wow... You really are some kind of Trainer, aren't you?
I can't believe Mimikyu would actually come to like you that much. It's usually so shy! I've never heard of it doing anything like this.
Yeah, I wonder why...
Is that right?
I've heard that some Mimikyu get down because Trainers say they'd rather have Pikachu... I bet our Mimikyu was probably delighted when you were so kind to it.
You know, it's pretty hard not to like someone who accepts you for who you are. Pok√©mon and people are alike in that regard.
Or that's my thought anyway!
I'm glad that Mimikyu got the chance to meet you, <var>. Thank you. From me and Mimikyu both!
Looks like there's nothing left to do in here.
