There are too many Frillish! They're trying to paralyze me!
Friiiiilll...
The Frillish have retreated back into the ocean!
Oh, thank you so much! You saved my life! Please, could we talk for a bit?
I was trying to catch a Frillish, but it called for help, and too many of them joined in.
I don't mind that they're so playful, but their veillike arms have a poison that paralyzes you. I didn't know what to do!


But well, I had the chance to get rescued by you, so I guess it wasn't all bad.
Hee hee! My heart's still pounding!
...Oh, here's a Destiny Knot. I'd be very happy if you'd keep it. You know, as a thank-you.
Well, I bet I'll see you again!
Ugh, there are too many Frillish! I can't even move!
Friiiiilll...
Whew, thanks for getting me out of that. I owe you my life! Hey, can we chat for a bit?
You see, I was trying to catch a Frillish, but... Well, it called for help, and I got overwhelmed.
It's nice they're so playful and all, but the poison in their veillike arms paralyzes you! I didn't know what to do!


But hey, I got to be rescued by you, so I guess it wasn't a total disaster!
Heh, look at me. My heart's still pounding!
Oh, hey, here's a Destiny Knot. Just as a thank-you. I'd be happy if you keep it.
Well, I'll see you around!
