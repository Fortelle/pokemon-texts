Everyone looks like they are having so much fun that I don't think they even noticed we left... Oh! And the Battle Royals are about to begin!
It's a beautiful festival, isn't it... Everyone looks so happy.
I hope that you'll always stay just the way you are now, <var>... Look how your joy has brought so much light to everyone here...
I think even my mother would have smiled and laughed to see this...if she would have come...
But she...didn't think she was in any position to meet you all.
She was being very stubborn about it, so I had to give her a bit of a scolding about it. Gently, of course.
I think...if I could just help her, and everyone, find something to smile about again...
<var>... I...I am going to—
Whoa-ho!
Look at this! Everybody's so fired up. Woo! We've got the birth of Alola's strongest ever Trainer to celebrate, after all!
I may have lost, but I'm gonna keep working hard to be totally in sync with my partners and pull out my Pokémon's full power!
And THEN... I'm coming for you! Champion <var>!
<var>!
Sorry! I mean, Champion!
I'm sure everybody here wants to see your partners, too.
Come on and show us that partnerose partners that wasere there for so many of your discoveries, new experiences, and adventures on your island challenge!
Mm-hmm! You're positively glowing!
