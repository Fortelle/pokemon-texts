You know that Verdant Cavern place, right? I guess it's kinda, like, sacred to Tapu Koko.
You aren't even allowed to go into it unless you're on your island challenge.
Oh yeah! Almost forgot! I have something pretty amazing to share with you, <var>. You lucky thing!
Revives are solid items to have! If your Pokémon faints in battle and can't go on, then a Revive will perk 'em right back up! But you probably won't find Revives here. Didja know that Poké Marts sometimes sell different things? And not just that! The two clerks at the counter even sell different things from one another!
Oh yeah! But you've got that Rotom Dex, right? If you tap it and play with it a lot, then you can use Roto Loto, too, right?
That'zzz right! Give me a tap when my eyezzz flash!
Awesome! Do it, <var>! Do it! Try Roto Loto for me!
That's so cool! Roto Loto can even make your team stronger! I wonder what other kinda Rotom Powers there are, too!
