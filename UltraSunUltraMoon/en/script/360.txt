Nebby... th-thank goodness...you're all right... Please don't ever do that again! You made me worry so much!
And I never imagined that sounding the flutes would give you so much power... or let you evolve into the Legendary Pokémon!
La-leeeooo!
Mahiiiiina!
Not in all of my reading... Never did I ever come across any hint that you would evolve into the Legendary Pokémon...
Please, Solgaleo...
No... Nebby. Please. I need to go to where my mother is! We want to protect Alola, but there's no need for her to try to stop Necrozma all on her own!
Please, Lunala...
No... Nebby. Please. I need to go to where my mother is! We want to protect Alola, but there's no need for her to try to catch Necrozma all on her own!
La-liooonaaaaaa!!!
Mahina-peeea!!!
Mother!
