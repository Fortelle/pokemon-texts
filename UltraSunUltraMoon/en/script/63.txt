Ho! Howzit, <var>? Man, I thought you'd never make it! Me and <var>'ve been waiting for ages!
Hoo!
Grrr!
Arf!
Hold on... Didn't anyone explain to you about tonight?!
Oh yeah, right on time!
But to what exactly?
Pew!
A full-powered festival for Pokémon battling! We battle in the name of Tapu Koko, pitting our best moves against one another in friendly competition to please our guardian. Woo!
So, you two will be taking part in the battle? I don't like seeing Pokémon fight one another, since they so often end up getting hurt. But...I'll be sure to watch you both.

Your Pokémon have fought for you, so show them the same care in return, <var>. Allow me to heal them for you this time.
Are you ready for this Pokémon battle?
When you feel that you're ready, come back and tell me.
Then let's begin!
