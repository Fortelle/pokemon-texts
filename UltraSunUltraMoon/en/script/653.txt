These are the Berry Fields. But there aren't any Berry trees growing here. Do you want to know why?
I get it. Maybe later then!
Well, you see, we came here to the Alola region thinking to help spread the word about using fertilizer in the Berry Fields here, too.
The town where we come from, a place called Camphrier Town in Kalos, grows plenty of Berries in the nearby fields. And we use fertilizer to help grow our Berries!
But in the Alola region, people don't have to do a thing to help Berries grow! You can sit back and let nature—and Pokémon— do all the work, and you'll have more Berries than you'll know what to do with! And that's why we stopped bothering with trying to farm in the fields here.
In fact, now we're the ones who are enamored with Alolan Berry culture! My new dream is to try to become a true Berry master here in Alola!
The Pokémon and the rich nature provide all the Berries we could ever need. Maybe I should start trying to grow some tasty veggies in this field here instead! ♪
