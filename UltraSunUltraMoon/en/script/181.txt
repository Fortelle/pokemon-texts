You... You've passed Kiawe's trial! Well done! OK! So that means you can now ride on Charizard...
In that case, why don't I tell you about a great way to play with the Pokémon in your Boxes!
You ready for this? Press [0xE002] to open the X menu, and then tap on Poké Pelago to take off, OK?
I'll be waiting for you and your Pokémon to visit!
