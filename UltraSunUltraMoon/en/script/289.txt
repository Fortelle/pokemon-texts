You people...
Not gonna disappear this time, huh? Seems like maybe the tall tales we heard about you were wrong.
That was different... Nebby and I were both in trouble... That was the only reason why it used its power. So we both could escape with our lives...
I know that I'm not capable of much myself, but I will not make it use that power again! I'm determined to not let that happen. That's why... this time I'll do whatever I can on my own even if I do find myself in trouble again.
Yo, girl, you know you're in trouble right now, right? Dumb spoiled little princess!
Leave her be. I like a girl who's not afraid to stand up for herself.
And besides...
I don't know about calling someone a Pokémon thief just 'cause she wanted to help out a Pokémon when it was suffering...
Please... there is no need to hurt anyone else here. I will go with you willingly. Wherever you want.
