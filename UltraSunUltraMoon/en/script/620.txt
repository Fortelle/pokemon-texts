There are many reasons why a Trainer might not be able to return to their Pokémon, but when that happens, either we have a relative take care of them or we let them go from their PC Boxes.
But there's one Pokémon that won't go back to the wild, no matter how many times we try to release it...
Cooped up in its Box, with nobody coming to get it... That can't be good for the Pokémon.
It would be great if there was someone who knew its Trainer...
Do you want me to look?
That's terrible...
There's only so much I can do, even as a foundation employee... So to be honest, I'd love it if you could help us out.
Thank you so much. Please, take this Poké Ball...
I wonder sometimes... Does the relationship between Pokémon and Trainers never change, even when one of them goes missing?
The Trainer who passed away... All we know is that he was from Ula'ula Island. I hope you can find something...
Hey, Mom? Do you know how Granddaddy's Pokémon are doing? I hope they're OK...
I don't know... Maybe they're going on another island challenge, with a new Trainer.
Dartrix jumped out of the Poké Ball entrusted to you!
Hoo...
Dartrix! You're Granddaddy's Dartrix, aren't you?!
Wait, why do you have Granddaddy's Dartrix?!
You explained how you were entrusted with the Poké Ball.
You liked Granddaddy so much, you didn't want to go anywhere, huh...
Well, don't worry, Dartrix! From now on, I'll be with you all the time!
For the island challenge?
To battle?
I don't know! All I know is I just want to be with it, all the time!
Heh heh...
You returned Dartrix to its Poké Ball.
You handed over the Left Poké Ball.
Thank you!
Here, take this Mental Herb in exchange!
Dartrix, you have to tell me all about my granddaddy! Like, why did he never evolve you into a Decidueye?
I can't believe it couldn't leave the Box, because it was so attached to my father... It seems like a strong bond can be a burden, sometimes...
