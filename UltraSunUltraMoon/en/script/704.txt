Should I risk a broken heart, or should I not and live in uncertainty...?
What's wrong?
Bye
Wh-wh-what's this?! You... Could...could it be...?
That Z-Power Ring, glistening on your arm!
That must mean you can use Z-Moves, am I right?!
Aah... This is destiny! A gift from the heavens...
Please! You've gotta help me with your full power!
Help you?
My full power?
Oh, uh, sure. Bye.

That's right! I want to see your full-powered Z-Moves!
Because, well, you see... There's, ah, there's someone I like...
I'm too afraid to confess my feelings for her! I don't have the courage!
But I feel like if I see a Z-Move, it would inspire me to go all out myself...

Please! You've got to help me find true love and happiness!
Sure!
Maybe later!


Fantastic! Don't hold back—show me those Z-Moves to your heart's content!
*pant pant*...
I felt your full power... Felt it to my core!
I'm so grateful! Please, take this! It's from my collection!
Thanks to you, I know what it means to be at full power, now!
Woooooo! I'm gonna confess my feelings!!
... ... ... ... ... ... I confessed my feelings at full power, but she was equally full powered in her refusal...
But well, it feels good to have confessed to her. Thanks for helping me out!
So long as you promise you'll be back! I'll be waiting!
No no no! I want to see you and your Pokémon go all out! I'm going to keep asking until you show me what I want!
Having said that, I'm all tuckered out for today! I'll see you tomorrow!
Now, I must push on! To find the next one-and-only love of my life!
