The Meowth statue is looking straight ahead.
There is a button on the back of the Meowth statue. Would you like to press the button?
Let's push it!
BEEP! BEEP! Intruder alert! Intruder alert!
You're back at the entrance...
You may have been able to get past the Meowth statues, but you can't get past me!
The man in the room here made us bring in two huge switches. I wonder what they're for?
Yeesh! You should just turn 360 degrees and get out of here!
How do the Meowth statues send you back to the entrance of the room, anyway?
