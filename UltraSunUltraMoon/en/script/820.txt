Wow! Olivia's store is actually way more chic than I'd have expected. I know she's the island kahuna and all, but she seems like such a normal person, you know?

I got in a spat with Trumbeak while traveling... But now we're closer than ever, so we're gonna take a photo together at the Alola Photo Club!
Kahuna Olivia is a Rock-type Pok√©mon user. It's pretty amazing, when you think about it. Rock types have plenty of weaknesses. She's definitely something, to be able to boast of such strength even when she uses such a disadvantageous type!
Opposite of the town you can find Memorial Hill and the Ruins of Life. You can feel the presence of the ancient kings of Alola there.



Alola, Heahea dweller!





Alola Photo Club Take a photo! It'll last longer!
