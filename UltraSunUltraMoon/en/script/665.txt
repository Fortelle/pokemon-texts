Sorry for starin' at you like that. In a town full o' Team Skull Grunts, you stick out just a bit.
Sorry for starin' at you like that. Even Team Skull avoids this town nowadays. Was wonderin' what you were doin' here.
Nah, I know what you want. You heard the rumors, too, yeah?
Rumors?
What do you mean?
Heh... You're a cautious one. I like that.
But... I've a need for caution, myself. What with my merchandise being what it is.
I want to have a battle with you, see if you can be trusted. You understand?
I'll battle you
No thanks
Let's do this.
I see. Well, do as you please.
Well, well, well... I've seen some Trainers in my time, but you're top-notch. I'll give you that.
All right, let me show you what I've got. A <var> for $<var>.
I'll buy it
Uh, I don't need it
You've got yourself a deal. Come back tomorrow if you want more.
Well, well, well... Sorry, I'm not the type to give discounts. Come back tomorrow with more dough.
Well, well, well... All you wanted from me was a battle, eh?
Don't think you can buy from me just whenever. Come back tomorrow if you wanna do business.
So, you're back. Well, if you want the merch...
