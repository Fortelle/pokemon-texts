Oh, hey there, <var>! Congrats on becoming the Champion!
I haven't quite figured out what a Champion is, but you're very strong, correct? I have a favor I must ask of you.
Ultra Beasts have appeared on Poni Island.
They must have come through the Ultra Wormhole created by Necrozma.
And being the Champion means you're stronger than the island kahuna, right?
Hello, <var>. Congratulations on becoming Alola's first Champion.
I heard that the battle against Hau to decide the Champion was quite the spectacle.
So, Champion, as they call you, would you be so kind as to give us your assistance?
Ultra Beasts have appeared in the depths of Poni Island. They must have traveled there via the Ultra Wormhole created at the altar on Poni.
Sadly, we are no match for them... That is why we request your assistance, Champion.
Me and <var> are gonna go, too!
Of course. You are two of the best Trainers in all of Alola.
We are heading to Poni Island now. Would you like to accompany us?
Of course. We're counting on you, too, Hau.
We were planning on heading to Poni Island immediately. Would you care to come along?
Of course!
I'll join up later
All right! Another trip together!
Very well. We will meet you both at Poni Grove.
Let us go, then!
We will be waiting for you at Poni Grove.
