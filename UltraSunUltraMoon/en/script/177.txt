Onward to the second dance!
Watch carefully and memorize this dance.
What was different from the previous dance?
Where they're standing
How they hold their bones
Where they're looking
How they're smiling
Show me again!
B-but how?! That was truly spectacular! And to add to the spectacle... Come, my fine Hiker!
Alola!
My Hiker friend was so pleased by your right answer that he simply had to battle you!
Astounding! It is astounding how wrong you are! Come, Marowak!
Wa-wak!
When you answer incorrectly, my Marowak grow so enraged that they cannot help but attack. Watch once more, carefully this time!
