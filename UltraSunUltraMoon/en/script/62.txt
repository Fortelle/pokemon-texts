The Alola region is made up of our four islands. And each island has its own guardian Pokémon.
Our festival today is held to express our thanks to these great Pokémon guardian deities for always remaining by our sides.

Well, we may call it a festival, but it's just this little thing you see here. There may not be many of us, but at least every last one of us here goes all out.
