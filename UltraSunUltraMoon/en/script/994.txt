My Starmie... It's been pointing itself toward space and lighting up its core... And not just that... The pattern seems all regular and deliberate?!
Mie!
The Pokémon Storage System that our PCs use was developed by a man from Kanto named Bill. Though the Alola Pokémon Storage System is maintained by our own Mr. Molayne.
I love having the café space in the PMC! Drinks normally cost an arm and a leg up on the mountain, you know!
I relax here at the café while my partner takes it easy off on Poké Pelago. Ahhh, what a life...
