Hello, Trainer. You finished the trial! I wouldn't ask anybody else but you... Would you take care of my job for a while?
Hello, Trainer who finished the trial! If you don't mind, would you take care of my job again for a while?
Sure
Not now
Oh, that's OK. I'm not in a hurry.
Thank you! I just want to go home to eat. I'll be back soon!
Oh, that would be great! I really want to go to the bathroom... I'll be back soon!
Thank you! I'm not sure if I turned off the water at home. I'll be back as soon as I check it.
Thank you! I left my wallet at the café area in a Pokémon Center. I'll be back as soon as I get it!
Appreciate it! I forgot to set my DVR to record the Alola golf tournament. I'll be back soon!
I'm counting on you. When Ilima gives you a sign, please open the barricade!
Congratulations! You've cleared my trial!
Great!
Then... Captain magic!
Would you like to open the barricade?
Yes! I finally made it! I cleared the trial at last! I'm so glad that I didn't give up and kept trying! I'll keep working hard!
Wha—? Won't you open the barricade for me?
You hastily opened the captain's barricade and let the Trainer pass.
I'm back!
Thank you very much! You seem to have taken care of things for me while I was away! This is a present for volunteering.
Thank you very much for volunteering! Please volunteer again for other trial-goers!
What a shame...
*sniffle* I'll try again.
No captain magic...
I couldn't clear the trial, so you don't have to open the barricade... *sniffle*
You hastily closed the captain's barricade, and the Trainer left...
The Totem Pokémon is too strong. Did you defeat it? Wow. That's incredible. ...I'll try again. Just knowing that the Totem Pokémon can be defeated gave me courage.
That was actually quite close.
Argh! That was so close!
No captain magic...
Huh? Why did you open the barricade? Don't make a mistake!
You hastily closed the captain's barricade, and the Trainer left...
Guess what! I reduced the Totem Pokémon's HP until it almost fainted. Then it called for help! Can you believe it? I was way ahead, but in the end, I lost!
Oh dear. Please don't cry so much.
Aaaah... I'm done... I'm uzelezz... I want to dizappear zomewhere...
I'll be waiting for you. No captain magic...
*sniffle* What are you doing? You don't have to open it. I lost...
You hastily closed the captain's barricade, and the Trainer left...
*snuffle* Was I weak and cute? Do you think Ilima felt like he wanted to protect me?
I think you may benefit from a bit more studying.
Tsk... All right.
No captain magic...
Huh? Did you open the barricade by mistake? What if I went through the gate?
You hastily closed the captain's barricade, and the Trainer left...
I really want to pass the trial with Ghost Pokémon! But Ghost-type moves won't hit the Pokémon there.
Please come back when you turn 11!
Why?! I want to try! I want to try the island challenge!
I'm sorry, but... No captain magic!
I haven't done the trial, so I don't think I can pass through this barricade.
You hastily closed the captain's barricade, and the Trainer left...
Hehe... No matter how many times I'm turned down, I'll keep coming back. And I'll keep taking a peek at the Totem Pokémon, and when I turn 11, I'll clear the trial at my first go!
Congratulations! You did a great job.
Whoopee! Thank you very much!
Now. Captain magic!
What?! Please open the barricade! Didn't you see? I cleared the trial!
You hastily opened the captain's barricade and let the Trainer pass.
I'm so cool. I cleared the trial nicely! I may be a genius! What shall I do if I become the strongest Trainer in the Alola region?
You cleared the trial. Well done.
It was tough, but it was fun!
Captain magic!
Hey! Don't space out. Open the barricade already.
You hastily opened the captain's barricade and let the Trainer pass.
I wish you could see my battle. I'm going to challenge Kahuna Hala right away. Do you want to come and cheer for me? Kidding...
Greetings. Captain Ilima here. It seems not many trial-goers are attempting my trial today. I came up with a new way of using an Escape Rope. If you're bored, I can show you. ... ... ... ... ... ...
