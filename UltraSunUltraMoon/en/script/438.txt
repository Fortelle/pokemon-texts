Intruders!
You'll be sorry you messed with Team Rainbow Rocket... Also known as Team RR!
Eeek!
W-wait one moment... My legs started shaking, and they won't stop...
Heh heh heh... Now who in the world waits just because an intruder asked them to?
Mmm, such a pretty princess! Don't worry, we're going to obliterate you nice and proper!
Hey, you punks!
M-Mr. Guzma?!
The hated boss who beats you down, and beats you down, and never lets up... Yeah. Big bad Guzma is here!
Hey, I know you... You're the boss of that pathetic group that got disbanded—Team Skull! I wouldn't expect much from just an Alolan thug.
No vision, no ideals... What does such a worthless punk want at Team Rocket's Castle?
Heh... I gotta admit... You got me all figured out!
I got nothin'... Not even my team anymore. I'm just another regular nobody...
But! I still got some things I can't let go... Things ain't nobody gonna mess with!
And guess what? You punks just messed with one of those things! I can't let that slide...
Hey, <var>! Gimme a hand here!
What?! We're Team RR! We're not supposed to lose to a kid and a punk!
They...they won't be obliterated!
Thank you for helping us, Mr. Guzma!
I just beat down the goons who were gettin' on my nerves, that's all.
Now, what're you standin' around for? You got a score to settle, too, don't you?!
Yes, we do!
I got your back! I'll be right here, and no one's gettin' through!
Here, let me heal your Pokémon for you.
Here, let me heal your Pokémon for you.
I guess I'm still not strong enough as a Trainer... I'll focus on healing your Pokémon for now. If your Pokémon need help, come to the room in the back!
I may not be very good at Pokémon battles, but I know a thing or two about Pokémon healing!
