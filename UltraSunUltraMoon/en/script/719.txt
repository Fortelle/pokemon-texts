I am enjoying my vacation to the fullest! Though I'm usually the owner of a jewelry shop.
Part of my job is getting my hands on rare stones to be used in our shop.
Like Snorlium Z!
Like Mewnium Z!
Like Marshadium Z!
If you bring along a Pokémon that can use such a stone, then I will give you a Z-Crystal!
Oh! You brought along a Snorlax! It should be able to use Snorlium Z, hmm?
Oh! You brought along a Mew! It should be able to use Mewnium Z, hmm?
Oh! You brought along a Marshadow! It should be able to use Marshadium Z, hmm?
Z-Crystals really are meant to be held by Pokémon, wouldn't you agree?
