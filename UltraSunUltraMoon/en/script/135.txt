Oh? So the two of you were friends?
That's right, we are! We're doing our island challenges together!
And next up, we want to go to Akala Island!
So I take it you beat old Hala? Our Mantine would be thrilled to have a couple of able Trainers like you riding them!





Great! So, like... How do we actually do Mantine Surfing?
Just go up to a Mantine and introduce yourself.
Do you think Mantine have rough skin like Sharpedo? Or are they all slippery and slidey?
