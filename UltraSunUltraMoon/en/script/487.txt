Wela Volcano Park... Hot as ever, huh?
<var>. I'm glad we could travel together like this. Please have a good time with Kiawe.
Lana... How about a Bubble Beam from Araquanid?
Alola! Now who am I?
The Hiker
The best Hiker
The same old Hiker
The suspicious Hiker
Good to see you again!
You looking for Kiawe? He's...oh! Right there!
Thank you for filling in for me while I was away, my good Hiker.
You never even have to ask, bro! Nothing better than dancing up here on the volcano with my main Marowak and you!
Yes... That's exactly the sort of intense training that made me who I am today.
That's why I was thinking that you might be a good candidate to become the captain after me.
I think you should let someone who really wants to be captain take the job, bro. I'm not the type who can help trial-goers or the Marowak live up to their full potential. 'Cause all I really want to do is bust a move!
Is that so?
You're here for Mina's trial, right? Would you like to burn in battle with me?
Of course
Sounds painful
B-but why?!
Being thrilled by an opponent's excitement... Nothing makes me want to battle more!
Astounding!
Alola!
My Hiker friend was so pleased by your right answer that he simply had to battle you!
See? I can't stop myself from wanting to dance! I'm just not the type who should be a captain.
<var>, you were spectacular! You were so spectacular that I will give you this flaming-hot Red Petal!
The energy that burns through Wela Volcano burns through us as well!
If you're hoping to complete Mina's trial, you should make for Hokulani Observatory next. Since you're here, shall we go together?
Yes please
No thanks
Then, let's be gone in a flash!
I see. Come talk to me again if you do want to go to the observatory together later.
You can't just dance to somebody else's tune, you know? Be yourself, and strut your stuff! I know I'd rather be footloose and fancy-free!
