Brooklet Hill is filled with Water-type Pokémon. It wouldn't be a bad idea to have some Grass- type Pokémon and Grass-type moves to use!
Brooklet Hill has its own Totem Pokémon!
The Totem Pokémon... They have fearsome attacks, yes, they do. Perhaps you'll want to use this Super Potion.
You'll want to prepare wisely with TMs and by using your Rotom Powers if you're going up against strong opponents. And I don't just mean the Totem Pokémon!
Slowpoke...
