Would you care for a little treat from a far-off region, dear?
It's a kind of pastry from the region where my Ilima went to study abroad. It's his favorite, you see!
Ilima gained the captainship because he exudes pure skill. Seeing him is like looking at myself, back on stage and in the spotlight again!
The young master is called the Prince of the Trainers' School among some. They may think he looks princely, but if you knew the true Ilima, you'd probably call him a fanatic more than anything. He's wild for battle!
Drrrr...
There's a photo of Herdier, also known as the Loyal Dog Pokémon.
Machamp here is a great helper! Sometimes Pokémon are good at things that people aren't, and the opposite is true, too!
Champ!
