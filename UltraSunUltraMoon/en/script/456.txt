Very well done, <var>! Please come back this way.
What a very surprising surprise... Who would have thought it? That all those Wishiwashi gathering would have summoned an Araquanid, that is. Heh heh... Even I was caught—hook, line, and sinker!
You were amazing, <var>. Truly impressive. Please take this.
You do know what this is, don't you? Watch. This is how you use Waterium Z.
And I have more than just that to offer you. Another token for clearing my trial... Here. This is a Lana original. One of my own handmade fishing rods.
This is how you use my fishing rod: When you want to fish for Pokémon, look for piles of rocks in the water. Fish like to hide in the shadows there. When you see your bob dip under the water, you have a bite. But you won't for long. The Pokémon will struggle to get away, so press [0xE000] as soon as you see the "!" mark.
If you want to catch any of the Pokémon you fish up for your team, I recommend Dive Balls.
By the way... Did you know I once reeled in a red Gyarados?
You did?!
Did you really?
Well, what do you think?
You did a fine job today. Shall I see you back to the Pokémon Center on Route 5?
Good. Let's be going, then. And you can always do a spot of fishing later.
I understand. Oh yes, I understand all too well. The siren call of the sea... and the urge to fish up something wonderful!
