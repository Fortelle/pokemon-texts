I'm the Team Skull boss, and I've never been scared of nothing or nobody. Heck, I live my life making people scared of ME! So listen to what big bad Guzma has to say...
Y'all are stupid!
How in the world did you even get to this place? I've got no idea how you did it, but here you are.
It's all dark here... I've got no clue what's going on, but there's beasts everywhere... I tried to catch one of those things...
but it possessed me! And that's when it happened! My body, my mind... They started running wild, and I couldn't do anything about it!
It was like I became somebody else, and I finally felt what fear feels like! It was terrifying!
I may be the Team Skull boss, and I've never been scared of nothing or nobody, but...
that lady...she's on another level! She's way far gone!
She lost her mind over these Ultra Beasts. There's no talking to her, no reasoning with her... She's just gone...
That doesn't change anything. I still have to go!
