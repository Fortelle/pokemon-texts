Hey. I'd like to say welcome to my shop, but I'm afraid I just can't do that right now.
Peli peli!
That fellow is my partner. Pelly the Pelipper. He helps me out with making deliveries, using that big old beak and that throat pouch of his.
Peli peli.
I normally travel around the islands, dealing my wares wherever I come ashore. But I've been here at Poni for quite a while now, and my supplies have pretty much run dry.
I'm in a real slump, and Pelly here is pretty much crying out in boredom.
... ... ...
Hey! You're supposed to be crying out, I said! What kind of partner are you?!
... ... ...
Why you...
Anyway, I do appreciate you taking the time to stop by anyway, so I hope you'll take these.
Those two are real valuable power boosters!
I know it's a generous gift, but that's just who I am! Right, Pelly? Pelly?
... ... ...
Come on! Throw me a bone here, Pelly! I thought you were my partner!
I really should be heading out onto the waves again soon, but it's so nice around here. We seafolk and our chief and even me, we all couldn't seem to help but fall in love with Poni.
Peli pelip.
