Wow! The aura readings are going crazy!
Hey! <var>!
Interesting... So this is what you call a tunnel... I would like to investigate it further if we only had the time to do so... Greetings, <var>. It seems your island challenge is going well?
It appears that my guess was correct: battling the Totem Pokémon, which are wrapped in aura, is having an effect on you as well.
And those Z-Moves also envelop your ally Pokémon in aura, do they not? ...Are you able to fully control aura then?
Sure I can
Not really
I suppose it does not matter to us either way. But once...long, long ago...our world was also awash in wondrous light, like the light of those Z-Moves that you can use...
Dulse? It's about time for our meeting.
Yes. We will be getting the aid of a scientist who is well educated in the ways of Pokémon. We will need his help to find ways we might use our technology to achieve our goals.
What is this? The numbers keep climbing in my aura readings.
Ah. <var>... I bid you Alola.
Hmm... This fine tunnel... It is most fascinating to learn that there are a variety of construction methods made possible by the Pokémon that lend their aid to humans.
Trial-goers clear many trials. It is only natural, perhaps, that such a Trainer would exude aura after coming in contact with so many Totem Pokémon awash in aura.
Oh, and you, young manlady... You seem to have even more Z-Crystals than when last we met. Do you hope to master the Z-Moves?
Sure I do
Not really
That wondrous light that appears when a Z-Move is used... We once had such light in our world as well. And it was precious to us, even if we did not use it to battle with Pokémon...
Captain Phyco. It is nearly time.
While our technology is advanced, it must be modified to work to its fullest with Pokémon. We must go now to meet with a scientist who is versed in the ways of Pokémon, or we will have no hope of achieving such a thing.
