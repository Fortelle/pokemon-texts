Guess I should congratulate you on clearing all three of Akala Island's trials, too. Congrats! Looks like it's time for you to take on Kahuna Olivia's grand trial!
Olivia is an expert user of Rock-type Pokémon. You're gonna wanna catch some Grass-type Pokémon in Lush Jungle to add to your team.
Whenever you're ready for the grand trial, come see me at the Dimensional Research Lab! It's down past Route 6, yeah, but just ask Rotom if you need some help!
