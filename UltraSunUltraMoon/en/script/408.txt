Great Tapu Koko... it was because of your help that Cosmog lived and was able to become Solgaleo. Please allow me to thank you on its behalf. Thank you so very, very much!

It's your turn next, <var>.
I want to see you show your appreciation in the way that only Alola's Champion could! I know you can do this, <var>. I'll make sure your team is ready, too.
<var>! Honestly! It's time you showed Tapu Koko your gratitude. Do it through one of the battles that it so loves.
You reached out and touched the statue...
You seem to hear a voice ringing in your head... as though it's coming from your Z-Power Ring...?
GOOD...SOLGALEO...
GOOD...LUNALA...
IT IS TIME...
Tapu ko-ko-ko-kooo!!!
Tapu Koko disappeared...
A Z-Crystal clattered to the floor at your feet...
There is no reaction from the statue...
Tapu Koko... It may have lost that battle to you, but I don't think it was sad about that. I'm sure that the two of you will meet in battle again someday!
Tapu Koko... I know it will aspire to ever greater heights at your side from now on, <var>!
So you'll challenge Tapu Koko another day... I suppose Trainers must know how to judge the strength of their opponents and must also understand their own limits.
The great Tapu Koko... It really is fantastically strong, isn't it! No wonder it is the guardian of all Akala!
But I'm so glad we could come here. It had been weighing on my heart...
Come on, <var>. We should get back to the village. If we don't return soon, everyone will realize that we slipped away from the festival!
