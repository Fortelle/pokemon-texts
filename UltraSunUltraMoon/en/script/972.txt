If your Pokémon's bellies are completely full, they won't take a bite of a malasada from you. But I can't claim the same for myself! Ha! But I'm fine with that. I've got gusto and I love it!
It takes an adult to appreciate both the bitter and the sweet parts of life. But then... if my Pokémon likes Bitter Malasada and I don't, does that mean that this little pup is more mature than I am?
