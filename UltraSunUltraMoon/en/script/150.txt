I simply can't suppress the curiosity welling up within me... That's why I would appreciate it if you would investigate those splashes in the water.
Did you see that splashing? I wonder what it is... I'd go and check it out for myself, but clinging to a clammy Lapras over the waves... Urp! It makes me seasick just thinking about it!
Oh my... So it was Wishiwashi kicking up all that water? Even a little Wishiwashi can make such big waves...
*splash splash* 
Oh me. What is that? I can hear wild splashing from over there... It sounds even larger than what we just saw.
Is it a Pok√©mon? Is it a person? I suppose we had better go check.
