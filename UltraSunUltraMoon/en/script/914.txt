I'm actually not all that good in fights. But no one will pick fights with me as long as I'm in Team Skull, you know?
Mr. Nanu told me I could... Naw, I mean, nobody told me to do it! I just happen to be looking after these Meowth! It's nice, huh? Having a place to call home...
Nanu doesn't call any of the Meowth by any nicknames. They're all just Meowth to him. But when he's not around, I like to call this one Nani, after him. Heh heh...
Mrowr?!
