What is a TM? To get the answer to that question, you should obtain a lot of TMs!
Let me ask you a question. How many TMs do you have?
You don't even have 10 TMs... Hmm... You can buy TMs at some Poké Marts.
I see, I see. You have <var> TMs! Ask for a Ride Pokémon's help, and look all over for TMs.
Oh! You have <var> TMs! Rumor has it that there is a place somewhere in Alola where strong Trainers gather and compete against each other. I've heard that you can obtain various TMs there.
Wow! You have <var> TMs! You're a great Trainer! You use TMs to show a whole new world to your Pokémon!
TMs... They can teach moves to Pokémon just by using them... What are they, really?
Do they bring out Pokémon's potential to use moves? Assuming that's so, if they are used on a human like you, can you learn a move...? I guess we can't try that.
Love TMs, and teach a lot of moves to your Pokémon!
