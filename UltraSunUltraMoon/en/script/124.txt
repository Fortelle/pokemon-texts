Start off by selecting a compatible Z-Crystal from the Z-Crystals Pocket in your Bag, yeah!
Then use the Z-Crystal you chose on a Pokémon!
Z-Crystals are compatible with a Pokémon if it knows a move of the same type as the crystal.
Have your Pokémon hold Z-Crystals, and you'll be able to use Z-Power in battles!
And don't worry, you can use your Z-Crystals over and over on as many Pokémon as you want!
