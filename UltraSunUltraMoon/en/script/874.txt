I'll tell you something Professor Kukui taught me. Moves that can attack all of the other Pokémon on the field, like Razor Leaf and Air Cutter, actually have their power cut in Battle Royals!
Getting targeted by all the other Trainers is proof that you're the strongest! But even so, you can't win in a Battle Royal if all you do is protect yourself all the time!
The Battle Royal format is fun because you don't know who your allies are.
There's this kid who's been winning tons of Battle Royal matches lately... I think he said his name was Gladion?
That kid Gladion... I wonder where he went. I never see him around here anymore. I really liked the way he fought. It seemed like he really believed in his partner.
Bull!
If Pokémon have taken damage from someone else's attack, try to deal them a finishing blow!
Chaaa-ahhh!
Do you think pro wrestlers change costumes so much so they can sell new merch?
Granny! Please! You've gotta buy me a Masked Royal mask!
Whoa! That's amazing! You've got a Masked Royal mask! That's it! True fans have gotta wear one of those masks when they cheer the Masked Royal on in the ring!
Will you win or will you be done in? Welcome to the thrilling Battle Royal Dome!
