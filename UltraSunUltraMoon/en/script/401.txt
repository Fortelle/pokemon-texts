So, here you are... Why don't we see who the winds favor today, you...or me?
Alola! And alola once again! My name is Kahili. A few years ago, I was a champion of the island challenge, too. Just like you. I've been traveling the world to improve my skill as both a Trainer and as a golfer. When I heard that they'd made a Pokémon League in my own home region, I came flying back to serve Alola. Have a look at my fantastic Flying-type team!
You know...I think you'll bring a breath of fresh air to the Alola battle scene. I was honestly annoyed when Kukui kept pestering me to come here, but I'm glad I did.
So, you came to battle me again! If I beat you, the number one ranked Trainer in Alola, then I'll be ready to take on the world! I'm coming for you, <var>!
That battle was worthy of being number one in Alola... Maybe even number one in the world! But next time, I'll win. You'll see!
There are three more members of the Elite Four. And every one of them is a top-class Trainer.
There are two more members of the Elite Four... And I wouldn't be surprised if you have a hard time deciding which one to take on next.
There is just one member of the Elite Four left. I hope you enjoy the transcendent kind of battle you only find at the top of the Pokémon League!
Do you wonder what lies beyond the Elite Four? Go. See with your own eyes what awaits you.
