We're members of the Malasada Fan Club, self-appointed malasada promoters! I'm Mala! This is my Pyukumuku, Pyukuku!
Pyu!
We're working hard, day and night, to promote how delicious malasadas are!
Let's start, Pyukumuku!
Pyu!
We'll be filling our bellies with the marvelous, magnificent, positively man-sized Big Malasada. Let's dig in at once! ♪ *munch munch*
Pyu, pyu, pyu!
Mmmph! Amazing! I keep eating...*munch munch* and eating...*munch munch*
Pyu, pyu, pyu!
And it just never runs out! *munch munch munch munch*
Pyu, pyu, pyu!
Tune in again tomorrow for more munchies! ♪ There are mounds of malasadas waiting! ♪
What do you think about the commercial song we sing?
Pyukumuku is a more ideal mascot than Slurpuff, which can't be caught in the Alola region! You see, the flavor bursts right out of it!
Pyu!
I appreciate their support. But they are a bit distracting.
Well, focus, focus! Let's get back to selling malasadas!
We'll sing until we become the store's mascots! Or until you give us Moomoo Milk, my Pyukumuku will spit its guts out!
Moomoo Milk! Moomoo Milk! If we have Moomoo Milk, we can make Mythic Malasadas! Please give one to us!
Moomoo Milk! Moomoo Milk! Now we can make Mythic Malasadas! Wait here!
Here you go! A Big Malasada! If you want a Mythic Malasada, buy it yourself!
Pyu!
Now I know! Instead of becoming mascots, we should spread to the world how delicious Mythic Malasadas are!
Let's go, Pyukuku!
Pyu!
They burst out of the store!
Until you give us Moomoo Milk, my Pyukumuku will spit its guts out!
