Hm, what's this? You defeated the Team RR goons, did you now?
Well, that's a shame. They weren't my real crew, but they were still mine for the moment.
...The name's Archie. I'm the leader of Team Aqua.
Just when I completed my great plan, I got swallowed up by a giant wave... And when I came 'round, I was in this world.
The boss of Team RR was kind enough to let me use this room as my own. I've been tryin' to figure out a way to get back to my own home.
And I do want to go back eventually, but I find myself thinkin'...
maybe I should make this world more like my ideal while I'm here anyway!
I've got the Sea Basin Pokémon, Kyogre... With its power to control the rains, I'll call down a great deluge to wash away this world's land!
All life is born from the sea! If we help the ocean expand, we're creating the cradle for future life to grow and thrive!
The best possible future for both people and Pokémon, don't you think?!
Oh? So you want to get in my way, just like that buffoon from Team Magma.
Well then, you little scamp... It's the rope's end for you and your Pokémon!
Well, would you look at that! I control the ocean and all its power, and yet here I am, beaten by a little tyke!
All right, all right... You've made your point. I can see you're not one to be trifled with.
If you want to get farther into Team Rocket's Castle, though, you'd better have checked out the pictures hanging on the walls. The red one, and the blue one, too.
It makes me wonder... If there was a Trainer like you back in my old world, would I have ever been able to pull off my great dream?
A switch behind the painting!? Should you push it?
Let's push it!
The switch has already been pressed!
