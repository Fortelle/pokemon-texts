Hey there, cousin!
Hang on, I know you... You're <var>, right?! You OK? I saw you get attacked like that!
Yeah, I got a bit of help
I was scared spitless!
Looks like you did! Though I sure didn't expect that, yeah... I didn't think these little fellows would dash out on their own to help save a stranger!
You and me both, cousin! I'm looking after these Pokémon, but they dashed right out on their own to save you!
But I guess I'm getting ahead of myself. Welcome to Alola, the Pokémon paradise! That's what I'm supposed to be saying. I'm Kukui, yeah. The Pokémon Professor.
People and Pokémon live and work together here in Alola, too. Don't you ever forget...
You can go anywhere, yeah, as long as you got Pokémon in your corner!
Wild Pokémon could be lurking in the tall grass, yeah, just waiting to leap out and bite you, but you'll be fine if you've got a partner of your own!
Hey there! Here, let me introduce the Pokémon that helped you just now.
This is the Grass-type Pokémon Rowlet.
Hoo!
And the Fire-type Pokémon Litten.
Mrawr.
And the Water-type Pokémon Popplio.
Bwark?
Y'see, the fact of the matter is... one of these Pokémon will become your first partner, woo!
Heh... Maybe that's why they wanted to save you?
Go on and choose the one you'd like to keep as your partner, cousin!
