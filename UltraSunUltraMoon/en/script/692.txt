There is a bottle on the ground with a relatively new-looking letter inside of it... Will you open the bottle?
To whoever is reading this letter, I would be very grateful if you could deliver this letter to Nainoa, a Trainer on Ula'ula Island of Alola. He should be at Malie City's cape.
And if you could challenge him to a Pok√©mon battle, you would be doing me a favor. I would go myself, but I figured you could get him warmed up for me! ...Just kidding, of course.
Huh? Who are you? You need something?
You tell him about the letter you found on Ula'ula Beach...
Th-this...this is a letter from Arabella! He's challenging me to a battle?!
I know you only found the letter and don't have anything to do with this whole thing, but please! You have to battle me!
Well, OK, but you have to battle me when you're ready! You have to!
Great, I'm glad you understand! All right, let's do this!
Arabella took me under his wing when I was back in Kanto... He's a Trainer at a famous Gym in that region, and I always looked up to him... But recently I've been in a slump, and it became harder and harder for me to write him...
So I guess he wanted to reach out to me, even if it meant throwing a bottle into the ocean... It's so silly, right? The letter could have just been lost, and I'd never know...
Sorry you had to get mixed up in this, but I gotta admit, I'm glad I was able to battle you! Here, take this! You deserve something for your trouble!
Maybe it's not too late for me to do an island challenge... Y'know, to become a Trainer like Arabella. Then I could visit him in Kanto and show him how strong I've gotten!
Do you want to read the letter in the bottle one more time?
