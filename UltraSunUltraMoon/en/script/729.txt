So this is Poni Island... I can tell that only the best Trainers in all of Alola gather here.
Nature and Pokémon and people, surviving together in their own harsh way...
That's no reason to come here and train, Chief! You're supposed to be on vacation! I would like to make it clear that I think this is a mistake!
Hm? You... You're the Trainer I gave the Thunder Stone to on Akala Island, correct?
You must be the first Champion of Alola. My name is Anabel, and I am part of the International Police. It is a pleasure to meet you.
The Champion?! You always impress me, Chief. Is there anything you don't know?
It seems as if you're in the middle of a mission. You should wrap that up first. They are tough opponents, but you and your Pokémon should be able to handle them.
Ah, so you're on a mission, too? I've got my hands full as well.
I plan to train at the Battle Tree, so as to be able to complete any assignment as a member of the International Police. Until we meet again...
It was good to run into you, Champion! Sadly, I only have this item called a Red Card. Please keep it as a memento of this encounter!
The Red Card forcefully switches any Pokémon that lands an attack on the Pokémon holding it. But once it's activated, the item itself is lost!
*sigh* I'd never hear the end of it from Nanu if I let anything happen to the chief. My new partner isn't very strong, but it looks like I have to go to the Battle Tree, regardless! But only as a bodyguard, of course. Well then, alola!
