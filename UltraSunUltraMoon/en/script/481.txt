OK, <var>... The Charjabug are all connected. Everything should be good now.
Now we're ready to connect the Roller with the Pinger!
Uh, the cables are looking a little unstable... I hope it doesn't cause a problem...
Oh no... The Charjabug will get blasted with electricity if we don't do something!
T-Togemaru! What are you doing?! Are you trying to save everyone?!
Togedemaru's Ability is Lightning Rod. It can attract electricity to itself. But...the current is too strong! There's no way Togedemaru's electric sacs can handle all of it!
Togemaru! Hang in there!
Agh! I-I-I gotta do something!
*craaaaash*
Z-z-z-z-zap!
