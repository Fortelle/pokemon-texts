The professor said...
"Hey there, Lillie! Bring me that great new Trainer. Woo!"
So I'm here to show you the way to his Pokémon lab, if you'll come with me.
It's, um... It's this way.
<var>!
Here. A little pocket money for you. Don't go wasting it on anything too silly!
Oh! Well done, <var>. You're already making friends, aren't you? And what a cute little friend you've found! I knew Alola would be a great place for us. We just keep meeting wonderful people here!
M-me? Well, thank you... My name is Lillie. It's very nice to meet you.
Looks like it's finally your time to shine, sweetie! Enjoy yourself out there with <var>. And don't be gone too long!
You...have a very nice mother, don't you?
We should get going. I'll show you to the Pokémon Research Lab.
