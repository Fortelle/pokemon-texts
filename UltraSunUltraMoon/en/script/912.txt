That kimono-clad fellow who's always flipping that coin of his... I hear he was once a famous Trainer in the Unova region.
I've been seeing this strange fellow around here lately, dressed in a kimono and looking flashy... Although, I don't see him now.
Corsal!
Those Team Skull thugs... They are taking the Pokémon they stole from others and skulking away with them by boat!
The Aether Foundation is taking care of all the Pokémon that those Team Skull ruffians had stolen from other people.

Catch plenty of Pokémon and fill up those PC Boxes, and you can develop your Poké Pelago!
Dew!
