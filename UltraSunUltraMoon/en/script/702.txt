Oh, look! The Exeggutor are sunbathing! Soaking up plenty of the sun's rays like that is how their necks grow so long!
Ah, see that? The Exeggutor are moonbathing! They love the warmth of the sunlight so much that they try to soak up any light, no matter how weak.
You're a lucky one for getting to see such a special sight!
