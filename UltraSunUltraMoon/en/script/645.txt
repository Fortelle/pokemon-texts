That's it, Crabrawler! Just keep punching, punching, punching!
Cra-blub!
Blub?!
Oh no! Come on, Crabrawler... Still too shy too fight in front of strangers, huh...
Hello? That thing you have there... Is that... Could that be...
A Z-Power Ring!
Please! You must have a battle with me! I want Crabrawler to feel the power and energy in a Z-Move!
Once it sees your Pokémon at full power, I bet Crabrawler will feel ready for a brawl and finally overcome its shyness and anxiety!
Blubub...
There, there... Now, are you ready?
Absolutely!
Give me a sec!
Great, you're ready to rumble! Then let's do this!
Oh, don't worry, I'm very patient. I'm used to waiting.
Oh, that was wonderful! You were almost shining with all the power!
Don't you think so, too, Crabrawler?
Cra-blub!
Oh my! Your fighting pose looks wonderful!
Oh, of course... You always hated losing, didn't you, Crabrawler? You've seen other Pokémon show their full power, and now you want to, too!
This is all thanks to you!
Cra-blub!
I know, I know...
This is from Crabrawler, as a sign of thanks!
Really, thank you so much... We're one step closer to our dream!
Um, um... We want to see you at your fullest power, holding nothing back. Come back again tomorrow, and show us a Z-Move. Go all out!
Today's punches are as quick and powerful as ever!
