Thing must've been scared half to death if it's glad to see a wretch like me.
What a lot of hassle...

Look, I'm not gonna fight someone who is taking on Team Skull. I'll heal your Pok√©mon up, so...go. Just go.

Though...looking around now... It seems like there're fewer Team Skull folks around today than usual. Huh.
I guess some of 'em might have run off after seeing their boss get beat.
