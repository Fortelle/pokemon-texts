I've been waiting for you. To thank you. For what you did for Lillie. For our mother. I appreciate it. Maybe more than you know.
And the only thing I can offer you in thanks is a great battle. So I'm going to show my full power... My real full power this time! With the Z-Power Ring that old man gave me!
You've got a good Pokémon. I know what kind of Trainer you are now. And what kind of journey you've been through.
I know why you of all people could save Lillie. Why you could save Cosmog...and Alola.
Last time I saw Lillie, she was heading up to Mahalo Trail... It seemed like she had something on her mind.
She's...she's gentle enough to be able to feel how much pain Pokémon go through. I guess that's a kind of strength, too.
Here. Take this. She wanted me to give it to you.
You know, I tried battling Hau, too... He's really changed. I'm not surprised anymore that he managed to beat even Kahuna Hala.
Hmph... If you two are going to get even stronger, then I guess I can't let down my guard yet.
I know we aren't friends. But we aren't enemies anymore either. Keep winning. Maybe I'll see you again if you do.
