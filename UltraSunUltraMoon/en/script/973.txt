No matter how strong I am, I know that there are things I can't do... Places I can't reach and people I can't protect. That's why I want to make all the kids at Aether House into superstrong Trainers themselves!
I wanna do the island challenge, too!
That settles it! I'm a big kid now! I'mma go do my island challenge, too! Th-though I'd be happy to pass on Acerola's trial, if I could...
Hey, hey, d'you know how big the whole entire world is? Is it, like, infinity big?
Hey, hey! Y'know what? My Yungoos wants me to tell you congrats on becoming Champ!
