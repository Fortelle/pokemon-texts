Hey, hey! Which Pokémon are you gonna choose as your partner? Have you decided?
Hey now! Slow your Rollout there, cousin! You don't even introduce yourself first, Hau?
Oh yeah! I'm Hau!
I couldn't wait for us to pick our partners together, so I came to find you myself!

Whoa! Your <var> is so cool! Hey, wait! You already picked your Pokémon?!
Sorry about that, Hau. We had a little accident on the way here, so I ended up letting <var> choose hiser partner first without you.
Fair enough. I guess it was just fate for you guys to meet!
But you can choose one of these two, Hau!
Hoo!

We're gonna do so much awesome stuff together! Just you wait and see!

You better believe I will, Hau!
All right then. <var>! Everybody! Time to get back in your balls for now!
