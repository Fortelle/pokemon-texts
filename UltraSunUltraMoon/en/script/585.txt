Um, hey, sorry, but... You're part of Sis's crew, right? 
Sis?
Crew?
Oh, uh, sorry, guess I should explain... See, I'm apprenticing here to become a cook. And Sis is the owner's daughter. Mallow. Her family owns this restaurant, you know?
Oh, uh, sorry. I was in Team Skull, you know? So I got kinda used to talking like that, yeah? I mean, you're one of Mallow's friends, right? I'm apprenticing here to become a cook.
Anyway, Mallow wanted me to give you this.
She said it was your reward for becoming the Champion, you know? But she's kinda shy, you know? So she gave 'em to me to give to you. Oh, but she told me I shouldn't tell you that. So forget about itâ€”you got that?
Mallow, like, totally saved me. I wouldn't be here if it weren't for her. She got me this job when Team Skull fell apart and I had nowhere left to go. Oh, but she didn't want me to tell anyone about that either 'cause she's so modest. Huh.
I'm gonna do my best now, and I'm gonna become a real chef. You'll see!
