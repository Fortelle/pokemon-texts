Yes, <var>? Would you like to give up so you can better prepare for my trial? Keep in mind you'll have to start from the beginning if you leave the cave now, though!
I see. Unfortunately, I'll have to ask you to go make whatever preparations you may need to and then come back to try again.
Good! Then go and defeat the three Pok√©mon. Only then will you be able to claim the Z-Crystal waiting in the final chamber of the cave!
Yes, <var>? I take it you would like to attempt my trial again?
Very well, let the trial begin!
I see. Unfortunately, I'll have to ask you to go make whatever preparations you may need to and then come back to try again.
