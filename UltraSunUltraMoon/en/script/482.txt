Thanks, <var>!
Togemaru and company... They were saved by the Totem Pokémon.
The Totem Pokémon is really something else! And that means you're one heck of a Trainer to have beaten that totem, <var>!
I'm curious, though. What is that aura that the Totem Pokémon surround themselves with?
I really need to work on the totem-calling machines, though... Togemaru, and Onejabug and company—they're all my precious friends.
You've got that right, Soffy. Finding things that you notice, even little things, and improving on them... That's how science works. Come to think of it, that's how Pokémon battles work, too!
