So, you think you have what it takes? You think you're ready for the island challenge?
Yeah! I'm ready! And my mom says I can go, too!
Then I guess I've just got to do my job.
You'll have to choose the Pokémon you want to have as your first partner.
Yaaaaay!
First one up here. This Meowth loves to nap in the grass. Easygoing and laid-back.
Mrowr.
Next up. A hotheaded Meowth with a fiery heart. I wouldn't get it angry if I were you.
Grrreow.
Last, but not least. Its heart is as big as the sea. The most gentle Meowth in all of Ula'ula.
Prrrrrrmrow.
So, boy. Which Meowth are you gonna choose?
Wow, no way! I can choose any one I want?!
Man, this is tough... Which Meowth should I pick...
What brings you here, boy?
What brings you here, girl?
Figured I'd better perform my kahuna duties, at least from time to time.
Hey, Island Kahuna... I can't decide...
What a lot of hassle...
They're all so adorable... I dunno what to do...
Well, here's someone who's a step ahead of you in the island challenge. Why not ask?
Yeah!
Which Meowth should I pick to be my partner?
Meowth
You want the easygoing, laid-back Meowth that loves to nap?
You want the hotheaded Meowth? It can cause trouble when it gets mad.
You want the gentlest Meowth in all of Ula'ula? You won't find a Pokémon with a bigger heart.
Mrowr!!
Grrreow!!
Prrrrrrmrow!!
Oh wow! That Meowth is just the one I was wondering about!
I hope you're planning on saying thanks to the Trainer who helped you pick, too, kid.
Right! Thanks, mister!
Right! Thanks, miss!
All right! C'mon, Meowth!
Try to contain yourself, if you even can. Don't want to run out of energy so soon.
I swear, the kid could have started out from Hala's island, but no...
Well, thanks. That helped me finish up my duties for today.
...Now, guess I can relax for a little while.
See ya, kid.
