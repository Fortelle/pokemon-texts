Land ahoy! All right! Terra firma under foot again!
Ula'ula Island is, like, another totally different place than Melemele or Akala, huh!
I've got an idea, <var>! Let's have a battle!
Sure
Why?
I want my Pokémon to get a deep breath of this fresh new air! Don't worry. I'll make sure both our teams are in fighting form first.
Bwah! That battle took my breath away! I can't breathe the fresh air that way!
We're supposed to meet up with the professor, right? Where was it? Malie Garden?

Why'd he want us to go to a garden? Guess we'll find out when we get there, right?
We've made it to Ula'ula Island now! And that means another new Island Pokédex for you, big boyclever girl! Fill 'er up! Zz-zz-zz!
