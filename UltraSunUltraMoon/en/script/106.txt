Ho! You and <var> are doing the island challenge! Great! Allow me to give you a Berry, then.
Oran Berries can restore some of a Pokémon's HP for them. You can feed a Berry to a Pokémon, or let one hold a Berry and they'll eat it when they need it.
If you're ever looking for more Berries, you won't have to look Berry hard! Wa ha ha ha! Berries grow like...well, like weeds here in Alola, so feel free to pick up any you find!
