So, you're the one Gladion was talking about? ...Hmph. You don't look like anything special to me.
I'm Plumeria.
I help keep Team Skull together. I'm like a big sister to all these numskulls. You have realized what idiots all these guys are, right?
But don't you think some dummies are cute in their dumbness? You know what I mean, right? You picking on my cute, dumb brothers and sisters is really annoying me!
Hmmph! You're pretty strong. I'll give you that. But mess with anyone in Team Skull again, and I'll show you how serious I can get.
