Oh! Hello, Trainer! Looks like you've got a Z-Power Ring.
Here at the Alola Photo Club, you can take photos with your favorite Pok√©mon as you strike your favorite poses!
You should definitely give it a try. After all, you came this far already!
Oh? Don't give up on me now! We haven't even taken your photo yet! Are you sure you want to quit?
Yeah, let's at least take one snapshot to commemorate all you've done on Melemele!
Well, come back anytime that you get the chance and we can take your photo then. I'll give you a little something special so you can check out your photos anytime, too!
Oooh! I like your photo! I'll give you a little something special so you can check out your photos anytime, too!
You got a Photo Album!
Once you've taken a picture, you can also decorate it with special decorations, too. It really adds some pizzazz, so give it a try!
And as you visit more places, Rotom will help you out with capturing more backgrounds that you can use when you are taking photos, too! Definitely come to take more photos as you explore the islands during your island challenge!
Open up your Photo Album from the X menu, which you can open just by pressing [0xE002]!
Once you open your Photo Album, you can decorate your photos with stickers and more.
Add some pizzazz to really make them shine!
If you choose to share your jazzed up photos from your Photo Album...
Then everyone who comes to play in your Festival Plaza can see them, too!
Would you like to move right ahead to placing some stickers on any photos you took?
Are your photos all simply amazing now?
If you want to decorate any photos later, you can always add stickers from your Photo Album!
Then let's open up your album...
