Good morning!
Let's get fired up and have a great day!
Yes!
Ahahahaha!
Everyone sounds cheerful and happy.
School is fun! I want to be here forever! Forever and ever...
Doot doot doo, just a kahuna... on a stroll...to the laguna. â™ª I'll try the island challenge someday! Someday... Do you know when it'll be?
Why don't you join us? Let's take the class together! It's really fun!
OK
No thanks
Yay! We'll have one more friend now. ...Pinky promise, right?
Tsk! Too bad! I thought we'd have one more friend. ...Great answer.
Everyone kind. I'm happy. My language is no good. But fun! I made friends. A lot! Will you be my friend, too?
...Thank you. I knew you're kind.
...You don't have to be my friend. But make my wish come true.
OK! Everyone! We have a new friend today! Hiser name is <var>. Be nice to himer.

Was everything you saw just an illusion created by Hypno...?
Oh? Where are you going?
I'll introduce you to the class properly once you've gotten a chance to say hi to everyone.
