Alola! You must be <var>, eh? My Hau has been wanting to meet you.
Why don't you rest a little while? Give your Pokémon a break!
Alola! I love to see kids and Pokémon full of energy!
My Slowpoke here is bursting with energy! You might not think it to look at this fellow, but Yokotsuna can boast enough speed and power to even take on Hala in an Alolan sumo match!
Low? Slow?
It's the snapshot of you, Hau, and Lillie!
