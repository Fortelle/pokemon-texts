Profezzzor!
Why, hello there, Rotom! Are you feeling nice and comfy there in that Pokédex of yours?
Never better! Zz-zz-zz!
Oh! Well, hello there. Good to meet you. I'm Oak—Samson Oak. I'm a Pokémon researcher, and I'm looking into the regional variants found around here.
And you must be <var>, huh? Young Kukui mentioned you to me.
Rotom, you be sure to help this fine young boygirl on hiser trip around the islands, all right?
Who d'you think you're talking to? Zzt! Of courzzze I'm doing that!
And you, <var>! I'll be trusting you to keep Rotom safe, as well! The young fellow from Kalos who helped invent that Pokédex put a lot of work into it. And as much love and care as any parent!
I'll be in the Malie Library if you ever need me. Feel free to stop by and chat anytime. If you're having trouble finding the library, just follow the black-brick road! Meaning the patterns on these paths, of course. Black circle, black triangle, black square. Follow that pattern and it'll get you there!
