Pew!
Oh! When did you get out again? I know that Kahuna Hala and the professor will keep you safe from any harm, but you should still stay in the bag and out of sight. It's safer that way.
Nebby, well... It seems to have taken a liking to you. I-I have read that Pokémon like it when you pet them or take care of them, you know.
All right, here's a lovely gift from me to help make today special, <var>!
You obtained a Pokédex!
A Pokédex is a real high-tech kinda tool, yeah, that can automatically record facts about any Pokémon that you meet. Your new partner <var> is already registered, oh yeah, so check it out!
And this is a Trainer Passport that I had put together for you.
Well, you got to meet the kahuna at least. Ready to head home now, <var>?
If you two can work in harmony with each other, you can go anywhere together!
Now that you met Tapu Koko, I can't wait to see how far you can go as a Pokémon Trainer!
I really, um, really appreciate what you did for us on the Plank Bridge. I won't forget you and <var>...
