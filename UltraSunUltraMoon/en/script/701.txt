There are skilled Trainers aaaall over the place in Alola!
If you can beat them all, then maybe I'll show you my full power, too...
Skilled Trainers?
Where are they?
Not interested
They're the ones you can battle once you've defeated everyone else in their area.
Let's see... You haven't beaten the Trainers at...
Route 3!
Route 5!
Route 8!
Diglett's Tunnel!
Hokulani Observatory!
Route 12!
Route 15!
Ula'ula Meadow!
Poni Plains!
Poni Wilds!
Poni Gauntlet!
And that's about it. Do you think you can defeat them all?
Seems like you've defeated aaaaall of Alola's skilled Trainers!
So, what do you say? Want to have a full-power battle with me?
Well, that's too bad. Let me know if you change your mind.
It's been a while since I went all out in a battle... This should be fun!
Now, let's begin the Pokémon battle!
That was a battle to make my spirit burn! Here's a token of my thanks to you.
I enjoyed our battle from the bottom of my heart! I can't remember the last time I had such an intense battle.
You're definitely one of the best Trainers. I'll keep an eye on you, to see if you get better!
When held, the Life Orb causes the Pokémon to lose health each time it attacks, but in exchange its moves become more powerful.
