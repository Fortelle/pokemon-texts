This is a secret place where you can come to play using communication features. We're holding a festival where Trainers can interact right now. We need someone to welcome those who have come here to play.
... You kinda seem like someone who will play a lot using communication features! There's something you can do for me! Help me liven up this festival!
All right! Thanks!
OK, so you gotta help me out right away! Someone has come to play now, right? Go have a chat with them!
Say whaaat? You're the only one who can do this. I've gotta ask you once again, so you've gotta give me an answer.
Someone has come to play now, right? Have a chat with them! Come back here when you're done.
You crushed it! If you respond to the request of someone who has come to play, they'll give you Festival Coins as token of their appreciation. Festival Coins are sometimes called FC so try to remember that. You can use FC at the facilities in Festival Plaza.
Oh right! I better tell you about the facilities in this Festival Plaza!

At a goody shop, you can get items for good value.
At a haunted house, you can get items if your Pokémon reaches the goal.
At a fortune-teller tent, you can learn your fortune for the day.
There are still a bunch of other facilities so you can look forward to those.
This is a secret place you can visit by using communication features. Right now we're holding a festival where Trainers who have gathered here through communication features can interact. We need someone to welcome Trainers who have come here to play.

All right! Thanks!
Say whaaat? You're the only one who can do this. I've gotta ask you once again, so you've gotta give me an answer.
Once again, people have come to play. Respond to their requests and you'll get Festival Coins!
You crushed it! If you get a lot of Festival Coins, that means you've livened things up by entertaining those who have come to play, so your Festival Plaza Rank will go up. ...Oh right! Let me give you a reward as thanks for raising the Rank.
Let's build a new facility in this open spot! It's run by <var>! It's <var>, <var>.
