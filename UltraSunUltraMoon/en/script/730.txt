Let me show you the top-secret document I've managed to acquire. It's regarding Ultra Warp Ride. Don't tell anyone I have it, though!
TOP SECRET There are two ways to control your movement during Ultra Warp Ride: motion controls or the Circle Pad!
Do you think you could tell me which one you prefer using?
Motion controls
Circle Pad
It's fun to tilt with the motion sensor, isn't it?
It's fun to slide around with the Circle Pad, isn't it?
