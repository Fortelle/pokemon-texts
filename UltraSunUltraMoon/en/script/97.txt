Howzit, <var>! If you're looking for good eats, you've found 'em!
Plus, malasadas make your Pokémon like you. And affectionate Pokémon are better in battle!
Who could resist giving their Pokémon a few malasadas, eh? They're just so cute!
Yo, yo, yo, check it! Whenever, wherever we meet you, Team Skull don't even greet you!
Yo, you wanna throw us a bone and hand over those island challenge amulets to us now?
Ohhh. So you're part of that Team Skull, huh? All you guys ever do is steal Totem Stickers and people's Pokémon and get in the way of other people's island challenges!
You know it! We hate the island challenge, yo! And every kid fool enough to try it!
Yo, let's check these fools.
<var>! Come on! Let's teach these Team Skull jerks not to get in the way of anybody's island challenge!
Where you think you're stepping off to, li'l mansister? You ain't even fought me yet!
Yo, check how I change the game with my mad Pokémon skills!
No fair! I was playing a different game!
Stupid kahuna's grandson or whatever! We're not a fan of you!
Let's get up out this port, B! Nobody has to know about this! We don't need your wack little amulets anyway! Wouldn't even take 'em if you gave 'em to us!
Those Team Skull jerks really must have too much time on their hands, yeah? But keeping other people from doing their island challenges isn't gonna just make it like they managed to finish theirs, you know?
I already went down to the Marina and screamed out over the ocean, "Watch out, world! Someday I'm gonna beat even my old gramps in an all-out serious battle!" So maybe I'll go try to find some more Totem Stickers next. See you around!
