Wow, <var>, you're strong, huh! You were really able to draw out the flavor of your Pokémon in that battle! The Totem Pokémon bowed right down to you!
Yes, even back at Wela Volcano Park my vaunted Salazzle didn't stand a chance.
Nor did the Wishiwashi that I had trained so carefully...
All right, you've cleared all three of Akala's trials! You even managed to get through my trial, and I'd say it's a real doozy! Here! A gift for such an inspiring young Trainer!
You received a Z-Crystal from Mallow!
You obtained a Grass-type Z-Crystal! The Grassium Z is yours!
Let me show you how to use Grass-type Z-Moves! You go like "Graaassss," 'K?
Since you've cleared my trial, <var>, I want you to help me train some Pokémon from here in Lush Jungle. Here, have some Nest Balls!
Hm? Looks like Lurantis didn't finish all the food. Oooh, I really want you guys to try some! Have a bite, Kiawe! You, too, Lana!
If you insist.
*lick*
The flavor from the Rare Bone seems to fill my whole mouth...
It tastes so good you might melt... No, wait. Is that my tongue that's melting...?
Uhhn!
It's...it's so...
S-SPICY!!!
What? What's wrong with you guys? Don't you have any taste?! Are you headed off to Olivia's for the grand trial?!
