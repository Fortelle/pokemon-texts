Here I thought it was that obnoxious Faba, coming to pester me again, but...
All this ruckus was caused by a child?
I am Team Magma's Maxie.
I had finally realized my grand design, only to be swallowed by a great fissure that appeared beneath me... When I awoke, I was in this world.
I'm enjoying this experience so far, though. The knowledge in this world is...fascinating.
I do intend to return to my own world eventually, but first...
I have decided to bring my grand design to this world, as well!
I will use the magma-controlling power of the Continent Pokémon Groudon to shrink the oceans and create more glorious landmass!
With more dry land to live on, the creatures of the land will no longer have to fight for territory!
This is the ideal world for people and Pokémon! A world without conflict! Don't you agree?
Do you mean to interfere with my plans? You are just like that fool from Team Aqua.
I can't allow an ignorant child like you to get in our way. I, Maxie, will show you the consequences of meddling!
So you defeated the master of the land— the great Maxie! Still, I wonder... What makes you so adept at handling Pokémon?
There has to be some reason I was defeated... That's what you're trying to say, aren't you? ... ... ... ... ... ... Hmph... You think I didn't know that? This isn't my own world, after all.
If you truly wish to continue farther into Team Rocket's Castle, there are two paintings that you will need to examine. One red, and the other blue.
I have my noble cause! To expand the landmass, for the advancement of humankind and Pokémon! This is where we part!
A switch behind the painting!? Should you push it?
Let's push it!
The switch has already been pressed!
