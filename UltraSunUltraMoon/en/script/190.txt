You want to know what happened three months ago? Well, I'd wanted to learn more about Nebby... I mean, about Cosmog. So I decided to come speak to Professor Burnet. But I got lost along the way...and ended up wandering about until I collapsed on the shore...
She listened to my story, staying up all night to hear it all. And then she even got her husband, Professor Kukui, to lend me his loft to stay in... And she told him to help me investigate Nebby's origins, too. Professor Burnet has been so kind, and she's still helping me try to find a way to get Nebby back to its own home...
She's been like...like a real mother to me.
