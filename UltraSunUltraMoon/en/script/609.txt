Greetings, trial-goer! I'm afraid this is a captain's barricade. Only those who pass the Ghost-type trial can come through here.
Ho! That's Ghostium Z right there! Then let me just get this thing out of the way for you! One second...
I've even got a special gift for a Trainer like you, who managed to clear Acerola's trial! Which would you like to take?
Fresh Water
Normal water
Here's a Fresh Water for you!
Fresh Water gets expensive because it has to be shipped here to Alola over the ocean. The Fresh Water from Mt. Silver is really great.
Oh! Sorry... The normal water is actually mine! But I'll give you this Fresh Water instead!
I store up this normal water by catching my Poliwhirl's Water Gun and filtering it through cloth into a cup. Water is precious in the desert!
Oh, and take an Adrenaline Orb, too! If you use one, it'll make wild Pokémon more likely to call allies in battle. And the Pokémon they call are sometimes extra strong or even different-colored Shiny Pokémon!
Beyond this gate stretches the great expanse of Haina Desert. It's a bit different every day, due to the wind... Or maybe it's the snorting breath of Tapu Bulu!
Alola, Champion! Beyond this gate stretches the great expanse of Haina Desert. It's a bit different every day, due to the wind... Or maybe it's the snorting breath of Tapu Bulu!
Whirrrrrrlll!!!
