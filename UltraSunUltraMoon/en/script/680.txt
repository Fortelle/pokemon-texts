You should really see this place during the day.
Oh! You're a trial-goer? I did my own island challenge once, long ago! Hey... Why don't you come here with me a moment?
When you see a rainbow like this, it's a good idea to pray that your journey will go well. It will bring you good fortune.
This isn't the typical sort of rainbow, like the ones you see when the rain lifts, but I think it'll still be effective. I'll be sure to offer up a prayer on this rainbow for your success on the island challenge.
I'll be praying on that rainbow that your journey is full of good things.
