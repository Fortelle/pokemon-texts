How...surprising. It's more beautiful than I would have expected... but the air is so thick here... It...almost hurts to breathe...
You're right...
Are you scared?
Do you think the Ultra Beasts really are Pok√©mon? I don't know what to call them anymore...
I'm not sure... Nebby evolved, and I'm in a different world, and there's just too much that has happened...
We should go...
La-a-a liona-a-a!!
Mahina-a-a pe-a-a-a!!
What is it?
Are you telling us that you have to stay there?
La liona!
Mahina pea!
I'm...I'm so grateful to you for bringing me here, Nebby. Thank you! I guess I have to go the rest of the way myself.
La-lionaaa!
Mahina-peeeaaa!
Will you return to your own world?
Will you go to Ultra Space?
