You can have up to six Pokémon with you on your team when you're walking around. Catch any more than that, and you should have 'em sent to your PC Boxes.
Any Pokémon Trainer in the world can have their Pokémon healed or use the PC here for free.
You can buy things and sell things at the Poké Mart. I feel better with a Bag full of plenty of Potions and Poké Balls. What about you?

If you use communication features to trade Pokémon with a friend, you'll both be happy. It basically doubles your happiness!
