The Pokémon Center is practically right next to your house, isn't it, <var>?
Ah...
Everything has fallen into darkness...
Pew...
Nebby... Don't worry—it's OK.
This must be what they call a solar eclipse. It happens when the sun gets covered up.
This must be what they call a lunar eclipse. It happens when the moon gets covered up.
Was a solar eclipse forecast for today? Ah, well. It must be some kind of good omen, yeah!
Was a lunar eclipse forecast for today? Ah, well. It must be some kind of good omen, yeah!
An omen? You think something good will happen?
Sure! A long, long time ago, Alola was cloaked in darkness, yeah... But people say that's when Alola's people and Pokémon blasted all that darkness away with light! And they also say that was why people started gathering Z-Crystals, and that custom turned into the island challenge.
<var>! Now that you've got that Z-Power Ring, I hope you'll collect tons of Z-Crystals! Woo! That's exactly what a move researcher like me needs to uncover new secrets!
Professor, that's not why she's supposed to be doing it... Come on, <var>. I'll show you to the Pokémon Center.
Visiting every last part of Alola, yeah... That will be your island challenge!
