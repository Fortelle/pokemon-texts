It has been some time since we last met, trial-going Trainer. I do not know if you have learned anything more about the Blinding One, but it seems we might now have the means to do what we came to do. If a Pokémon caught in a Poké Ball can be made to obey the orders of the one who catches it, then we should be able to control Necrozma!
Pokémon caught in Poké Balls are loyal to the Trainers who hold them. It should be the same for Necrozma... So we will need you to leave us in peace so that we may do our job.
Captain Phyco, they only seem worried for Cosmog's safety...
And they are able to use Z-Moves. The power of the Blinding One.
Are you suggesting that we rely on children? To stand against the wild fury of Necrozma?
Is it not kinder to them to stop them here, rather than send them against that thing?!
I will battle you... I will battle you with our Pokémon. The Ultra Beast Poipole.
How infuriating. It is most unsatisfying to find something that our technology cannot overcome!
It seems that we might yet be able to resolve this somehow if we could use Z-Power. And yet... Our expertise when it comes to battling with Pokémon is so terribly insufficient...
We will find a way to deal with Necrozma. You children should pursue your own dreams.
Don't end up with the same kinds of regrets that we have...
