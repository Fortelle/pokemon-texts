This may be a bit sudden, coming from me, but I'd like you to have these.
They are all items related to Pokémon that Madam Lusamine hoped to meet someday...
If you like, I can tell you what any of them does.
DNA Splicers
Prison Bottle
Soul Dew
No need
Ah, the DNA Splicers... They are said to be able to fuse a Pokémon called Kyurem with either Reshiram or Zekrom.
Yes, the Prison Bottle... Apparently it allows a Pokémon called Hoopa to change its appearance.
Yes, Soul Dew... If the Pokémon Latios or Latias holds it, the power of their Psychic- and Dragon-type moves will both go up by 20%.
You can also view the explanations for any of the items by checking them out in your Bag.
But you know... even if it comes from the desire to keep all of your beloved Pokémon beside you always... using Pokémon moves to put them into a cryogenic sleep is too much.
The Pokémon who sleep now... I will keep them safe so that they can someday return to their previous state...
