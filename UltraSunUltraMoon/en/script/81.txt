<var>... I can't believe that you...
beat all of my students! Fantastic!
After seeing such a performance, I think I'd like to battle you myself! What do you say? Are you ready to take me on?
Good. I heard about you from Professor Kukui. I'll be challenging you with a Pokémon that has a type advantage against that <var> you chose for your partner!
You must be joking! You do know how much experience you could gain from battling me, right?
Nice! Maybe you'd like to take over as teacher here for me!
All joking aside, though, I do want you to take these from me... It's a little reward for beating me.
They're Great Balls. Great Balls are better at catching Pokémon than normal Poké Balls.
Know your Pokémon and know their moves. Those are the basics of being a Trainer!
How about it?
