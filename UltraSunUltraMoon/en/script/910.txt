So you've completed all four of your grand trials. Then go forth to the Pokémon League.
Welcome to the Pokémon League, Champion!
Tapu Village... The village was named that because the tapu appeared here to protect Mount Lanakila, which reaches up so close to both the sun and moon. But all that's left of it now is the name...

Oh... That abandoned site? Yeah. It was overrun by Ghost-type Pokémon. If you went in there, you'd never come out again.
People like to say that Tapu Bulu destroyed the supermarket in its rage, but that's not right. It's the people themselves who were to blame! What did they think would happen when they built a shop on land that's sacred to the tapu?
Maybe that old shop wouldn't have been destroyed if they'd built it in a way that pleased Tapu Bulu and the other Pokémon. Looking at what they've achieved up on Mount Lanakila, that's what I've begun to think.
It's Your Thrifty Megamart! An Oasis of Savings! So Spacious and Gracious!
Raf! Raf!
I bet if you could find a way to store all your treasures in an Araquanid's bubble, they would be safer there than in any safe in the world...
