I know that many of you must have heard of the dark clouds covering Poni Island on the news... You may be feeling concerned now about what is going on, but let me put your fears to rest.
This phenomenon was caused by a previously unknown Pokémon called Necrozma.
Necrozma passed through an Ultra Wormhole, a wormhole that connects different worlds, and came here to steal Alola's light.
*chatter chatter*... Necrozma...? What does she mean, steal our light...?
There is nothing to be worried about, though. Thanks to the actions of one brave Trainer, the threat has already been dealt with. Alola will not be swallowed by darkness.
*flash flash*
The Aether Foundation will conduct extensive research into the Ultra Wormholes, so that we can prevent any such events in the future.
To be specific, we will begin by—
Wha—?! That hole... How is that possible...?
An Ultra Wormhole? But why now?!
Eek!
Who...exactly are you, sir?
The technology of the Aether Foundation...the knowledge of other worlds—
it will be very useful to Team Rocket... or rather...
Team Rainbow Rocket!
Did he mean to suggest that his people created this Ultra Wormhole intentionally...? We will not allow this to go unchecked!
P-President! Please, come back!
Hello? Are you seeing this? The sudden turn of events has left the scene in chaos!
Team Rainbow Rocket...? Is this some kind of prank?
