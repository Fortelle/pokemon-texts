Looks like you slept well, <var>.
A-lo-la!
The salty breeze sang to me and brought me here to you!
Oooh! And there's that Kantonian Meowth! Look at that shiny coin on your head, kitty-kitty!
Mrowr?
I finally got my gramps to go all out and be serious in a battle against me! I got some sweet rewards, so take this one, <var>! Good luck is best shared!
You obtained a Z-Crystal for Decidueye. The Decidium Z is yours!
You obtained a Z-Crystal for Incineroar. The Incinium Z is yours!
You obtained a Z-Crystal for Primarina. The Primarium Z is yours!
Now you can power up, too, <var>!
That's so nice of you, Hau. Thank you!
Naw! No problem, auntie! Say. Is Kanto, like, really far way?
It's pretty close
It's pretty far
Yes, I'd say it's pretty close. Close enough to visit whenever you want to!
Well... it's true that it's not the next island or anything. But it's still close enough to visit whenever you want to!
All right! Then it's decided! I'm gonna get stronger and stronger, and then I'm gonna travel the world with my Pokémon! I'm gonna go find Lillie! And my dad, too!
Your father?
Oh, yeah, him. Heh... He's a strong Trainer—real strong, I think. But I guess he really hated being the son of a kahuna and everything, yeah? So he works far away from Alola these days.
I think I'm gonna go train myself up at the Battle Tree, then beat you, <var>... and I'll be a Champion next time I see him! Seems like a nice little present, eh? Hehe!
What is a Battle Tree, Hau?
Oh, it's this thing way deep on Poni Island! Anybody who has passed the island challenge— or who is strong enough to, anyway—can battle it out with their Pokémon! Or so they say.
<var>! Let's have the best ever battle at that Pokémon League sometime. No backing out!
That's right... Now that you're the current Champion, everyone is going to want to challenge you!
Mrowr!
