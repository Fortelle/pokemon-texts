Oh, hello! Hello! Alola!
Did you know that Alolan Grimer are in fact not native to the region at all, but instead are what we would call naturalized Pokémon? There is not so much sludge and pollution for Grimer to feed on here in Alola, though, so they have grown to feed on garbage instead. They do not give off a foul stench, thanks to the way they contain any poisons within their bodies, but their crystals are terribly poisonous!
Here! I've got something good for you!
I hope you'll try to complete your Pokédex. For Rotom's sake as well!
The sea washes away everything... Even your muddy feelings and emotions. Just like a good Haze will clear away any stat levels that have been changed in a battle.
