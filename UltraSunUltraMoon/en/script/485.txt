Greetings. Captain Ilima here. It seems you've collected a great number of Z-Crystals, <var>. You are positively shining!
Yes, it's important to always shine. You know, I've traveled the world since I was young with my mother. She's an actress on the stage, you see.
In doing so, I came to realize something. I realized how beautiful my mother was when she dedicated herself completely to the role she was performing onstage... Yes, it is moving to see such complete dedication—to anything!
The brilliance of the Z-Crystals! The gleam of Totem Stickers! In my role as captain, I just want to do my part to make everyone shine!
But...let's set all that aside. You're here for Mina's trial? Then allow me to check just how strong you have become!
Yes please!
No thanks!
In a sense, this is a trial for me as well. A trial to see if the strategy I've thought up will work!
Understood. I'll take a bit more time to develop my own strategies as well.
You— No, you and your Pokémon have become quite a delightful team!
Please take this Orange Petal. It has a definite warmth to it, just like me.
So now it seems you have two petals. Wouldn't you like to see what happens when you have collected all seven?
You know, Hau has been out on Mahalo Trail doing nothing but training and has improved a good deal!
For now, though... Should I see you to the next captain?
Please do
I'm good
Shall we, then? To Lush Jungle! It's been a while since I last visited Akala.
Please do let me know when you'd like to go to Lush Jungle.
