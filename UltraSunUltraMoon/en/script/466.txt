Thanks for stopping by!
Lemme check the ingredients you got for me!
Let's see that Mago Berry first!
Cuh-cuh!
Oops! You went and took the Mago Berry that Fomantis had its eye on, didn't you!
All right, then. Let's put this Mago Berry into the pot, and... There! We pour in the Fresh Water that Lana brought us!
Next up is the Honey!
Cuh-cuh!
Com com com!
Well, Fomantis sure does love its Honey!
You brought the Honey that Comfey was hoping to sip up, didn't you?
Now we mix the Honey in using the Thick Club that Kiawe brought along...
And last but not least, the Big Root!
Woooooo!
Those Sudowoodo! They like to put Big Roots around their feet to look more like real trees. I guess this one wanted its Big Root back!
And finally, it's finished...with one last pinch of my super-special secret spice!
Ta-da! The Super Mallow Special! It's all done and it smells delicious!
