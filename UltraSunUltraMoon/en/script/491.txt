Welcome back, <var>! Was everyone doing OK?
We captains love getting to see how kids like you and your teams grow. Trial-goers and those of us who watch over the trial-goers, we all get to share that joy with our Pokémon, you know?
All right, then. Lend me the seven petals you collected for a second, would you?
Here you go. One Rainbow Flower! I made it from the petals you got from everybody.
So then, where's that Totem Pokémon?
This is the final Totem Pokémon for the final trial of your island challenge. ♪ I hope you're ready for your toughest totem yet!
Bom-beeeeee! ♪
Come on, Rainbow Flower! Do your magic! You're made up of everybody's petals, so call that Totem Ribombee here to us!
