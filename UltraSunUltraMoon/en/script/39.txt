Why don't you go ahead and choose the one you'd like to keep as your partner, cousin?
Rowlet can fly up on its enemies real quiet like, yeah, and catch 'em by surprise!
Litten may use Fire-type moves, but it's one cool cat!
Popplio works hard and makes some pretty awesome balloons!
Hoo?
Mrawr?
Bwark!
So, you wanna go with the Grass-type Pokémon <var>?
So, you wanna go with the Fire-type Pokémon <var>?
So, you wanna go with the Water-type Pokémon <var>?
You chose <var>!

I know the feeling, cousin... I had a real hard time choosing once, too.

Rowlet
Litten
Popplio
