Are you curious about why there is a huge ranch instead of a big city right slap in the middle of Akala Island?
Oh. Sorry I asked.
This area, which is called Paniola, is a very old place in the history of pioneer Alola.
When our ancestors drifted to the islands in Alola and decided to live here, the land was not habitable.
So our ancestors developed the land with their Tauros just as they did before they came to Alola.
They kept the most fertile land as a ranch, so they wouldn't forget their gratitude for Tauros.
The history of pioneering in Alola... Since the very beginning, humans have lived with Pok√©mon.
