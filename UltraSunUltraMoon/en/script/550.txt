This place here is a haven where children and Pokémon can rest and be at peace. But I'm in the middle of cleaning right now, so I'll have to ask you to leave.
I know you. Thanks to your efforts, both the president and the foundation were saved. That's what I've heard.
I would like to entrust you with a very precious Pokémon, as a show of gratitude from myself. Will you take this Porygon from me?
It looks like your Boxes are full, though. Please make some space and come back again.
Porygon is a miracle born of science. A Pokémon with a digital brain.
Science exists to lead us to a brighter future. And I am here to protect those who will inherit that future.
The Aether Foundation funds this facility. People and Pokémon can all live here, as equals and as family.
You're <var>, aren't you? I heard about you from Ms. Wicke. As a member of the foundation, I'm grateful to you...so please take this.
I believe that the foundation will change after... well...all that ruckus that happened. We will reflect on our errors and remake the foundation as something even more than it was. We will work hard to update and improve.
I can admit that I did wonder for a time about whether I should quit the foundation. But I want to keep protecting the smiles of the children and the Pokémon here.
