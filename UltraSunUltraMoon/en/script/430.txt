It will take more than a hodgepodge party like that to defeat Team Rocket! Muahahahahahahahahaha! Muaaaaahahahahahahaha!
Don't give up, <var>! I know you can do this... Keep trying until you defeat them!
Impossible! This kid...defeated me?!
That's unfair! You shouldn't be able to battle so effectively with other people's Pok√©mon!
Bah... Get 'em, guys!
We can't let you take back Team Rocket's Castle. The boss's plans depend on it!
Just in time... Full system restore!
Target set to Team Rocket... Executing kick from Festival Plaza!
Whew... That was close. ...Thanks for your help, <var>!
You kept them busy just long enough for me to get back full admin access...
I've used that access to lock out Team Rocket from Festival Plaza forever!
I also restored all the features and everything to normal, too.
What about the castle?
What about the design?
I...kinda like what they did with the castle. Even though they were our enemies... I'll add it as one of the themes.
And I'll set up some boss data that'd be perfect for this kind of castle.
Also... This is for you. You helped me out a lot...
I'm really glad you came with me, <var>.
Let's go home...
If you want to change the look of the castle, try raising your Festival Plaza Rank!
