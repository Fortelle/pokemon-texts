Wow, <var>, you're even stronger than I thought! You really drew the best out of your team! You even quieted down that Lurantis—the Totem Pokémon of Lush Jungle!
And you got all the ingredients without even battling any Pokémon! As the captain, I really appreciate your looking out for the Pokémon living here in the jungle!
You battled your way through the Pokémon living here in the jungle to get me the ingredients I need. You and your <var> there make a fabulous team!
Yes, even back at Wela Volcano Park, my Marowak didn't stand a chance.
Nor did the Araquanid that I had trained so carefully...
Well, looks like you've cleared all three of Akala's trials! An amazing Trainer like you, who even cleared my super-hard trial, definitely deserves this!
You received a Z-Crystal from Mallow!
You obtained a Grass-type Z-Crystal! The Grassium Z is yours!
Let me show you how to use Grass-type Z-Moves! You go, like, "Graaassss!" OK? Here, watch me!
Since you've cleared my trial, <var>, why don't you try raising some Pokémon from Lush Jungle? Here, have some Nest Balls!
Huh? Hey, Lurantis didn't finish its food! Well, can't let it go to waste. Lana, Kiawe—you guys should have some!
Huh? Umm... I'm pretty full right now... I, uhh... I just ate a Berry. Yeah.
And that food you cooked is suited to Pokémon's taste buds, right? I think it's probably best to save it for when Lurantis wants some more...
Y'think? Olivia always says she thinks it's delicious. I think people would enjoy food cooked for a Totem Pokémon, too. Your guys' loss!
Well, I guess I'll just go take this to Olivia! See ya around, <var>!
