I came all the way from this faraway region called Johto to visit Alola. Is it true you can't use Fly to fly around here?
I don't know. Is it?
Yes, it is
Seems like! I got told off for trying it! They said it was some kind of law or something! But then how do folks in Alola fly around?
Wow... So it's really a thing? This really is a whole different region. But then how do folks in Alola fly around?
On Charizard
With a Ride Pager
Wow... So everyone just rides around on special Charizard that've been raised for the job? Sounds weird, if you ask me, but I've gotta admit that riding on a Charizard would be a blast!
Ho, so that's how it works, huh? Special gear that can call Pok√©mon? I'd heard that Alola had a great transportation system, but it's really true, huh?
Thanks for teaching me about how things are here in Alola. Here, I'll give you this lovely TM for your help!
Back where I'm from, in Johto, this kind of TM is a real big deal. They're called Hidden Machines, or HMs, because they're so hard to get your hands on. But here I guess it's just another TM. Maybe you can use it in battle or something!
The way people live can be different depending on where they live. The value of things also depends on where you happen to be. One of the best things about traveling is getting to feel and understand that up close.
