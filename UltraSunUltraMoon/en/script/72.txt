Ahh... There they go again...
The Pokémon Research Lab has its own unique charm, as I think you might agree. I've actually been, um, imposing on the professor here for the past three months. I'm not much of an assistant, but it's the least I can do to pay him back for letting me stay.
Maybe I'd be more help if I were a real Pokémon Trainer, too...
Raaaa-oooooohhh! Raff ruff!
Oh yeah, Rockruff! Let's go! Give it everything you've got! My body is ready. Woo!
The professor... He never stops researching moves. Not even...inside the lab itself.
Looks like we'll have to patch the roof again...
And I had just washed his lab coat and finally gotten it clean, too. Now it'll be in shreds... and I'm no good at mending clothes... so he'll just have to buy another new one...
We should probably go in before he does any more damage...
Please don't wander off!
