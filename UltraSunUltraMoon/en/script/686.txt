I...should... I...should...burn...
You hear a voice from somewhere...
I should burn...such things... Yes, I should burn...all of them...
*shriek shriek* Wh-who are you?
You told her the rumor about the seven mysteries...
Wha—? Am I one of the seven mysteries? Are you kidding?! No way!
I just... I just wanted to burn some letters... I was just burning them secretly. Did the flames make people think that it was some kind of spirit or something?
I wrote love letters for the person I like and wanted to give them to him.
But he already... So...
So you burned them?
Are you really OK with that?
You don't understand how I feel! Take this! The heartbroken power of a girl with a fragile heart!
*sob sob* I lost the Pokémon battle and also the battle of the heart...
You still have hope
Don't give up!
Eh? That's the nicest thing anyone has ever said to me...
... ... ... ... ... ...
That's right! My love won't burn out. Thanks to you, I feel much better now. Thank you!
All right! My island challenge to look for love will start now!
All you find in the incinerator...is ashes!
