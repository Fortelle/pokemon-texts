This time I've made two machines to summon the Totem Pokémon!
I call this one the Pinger. It's the machine that actually summons the Totem Pokémon.
And this one, the Roller, is designed to provide electricity to the Pinger.
We'll use both the Roller and the Pinger during my trial.
But we'll need the help of Charjabug to use the Roller...
