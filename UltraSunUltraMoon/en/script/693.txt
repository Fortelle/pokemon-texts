The abandoned site of Thrifty Megamart...
They say it was destroyed because it angered Tapu Bulu, but is that really the truth?!
If only I could interview Tapu Bulu in person, maybe I could find out what really happened.
What's this? In your party... Is that Tapu Bulu?!
Please, let me have an interview!
Please! This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.
Really?! Oh, thank you so much!
Right, then let's get started.
So, Tapu Bulu! Is it true you're responsible for destroying the Thrifty Megamart here?!
Bulu-lu.
Bulu-lu... I see... You're being evasive about this...
Very well, we'll leave that topic for now. But I do have another question for you! How do you feel about the people living here?
Bu-lu-lu!
Hmm, bu-lu-lu... Interesting... I assume that means it's hard to describe your feelings.
Bu-lu-lu!
What?! Bu-lu-lu?! What exactly do you mean by that, Tapu Bulu?!
Bulu...
Tapu Bulu returned to its Pok√© Ball, trembling with frustration!
Aww, what a drag! I had more questions to ask!
But still, thanks! I should be able to write an interesting article!
Here's your payment for the interview. Go on, take it! You've earned it!
Let's see, what would be a good headline... A Truth Obscured?! Is Tapu Bulu's Nature Actually Careful?!
How does that sound?! Ooh, I wish I could ask more questions!
Now! I need to get back to the office and start writing!
