Ngh! So I'm still not strong enough.
All the days that I struggled alone and lonely... it was all for nothing? Is that it?
The hated boss who beats you down and beats you down and never lets up... Yeah. Big bad Guzma is here!
I did that spoiled little brat a favor and crushed him. Yeah, that was me. Y'know, I kinda liked you, kid. Leaving home like that and wanting to get stronger and stronger. You had some real guts. Going so far as coming over to Team Skull. And rejecting your own mother?! That was impressive.
And now it's your turn! You little misfits keep getting up in my grill, like a cloud of smoke that I can't brush away. It's time I put out your fire at the source!
Guzma! What is wrong with you?!
Tch. Looks like I got no choice. Go on...go through.
If I want to beat you down... I've gotta get at least as strong as you! I can't believe you beat me down like that!
Please...help Lillie... and save Cosmog! I'll be right behind you...
