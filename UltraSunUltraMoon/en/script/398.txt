Hey!
Kukui asked me to, so I decided to be in the Elite Four. I'm looking forward to battling against you and Sophocles in the Pokémon League.
Kukui made Trainers who he thought were strong into members of the Elite Four, but he didn't choose any challengers. He's waiting for a fresh breeze to blow through Alola.
The Pokémon League is fantastic! It's a place that conveys the awesomeness of Alola to the world. And in that case, I guess that what's important is what kind of Trainer the Champion is.
Just as I'd expect from the Champion! In every situation, you pick the best moves and items. So I too have to rack my brain in the battle...
<var>! You're gonna be a Trainer who everyone admires.
In the battle with you, I realized the areas in which Sophocles needs to improve.
Battling with you is interesting! I think you outdo even Kukui. You're second to none!
Just what I'd expect of a Pokémon Trainer discovered by the Masked Royal.
