Honey, I'm home!
Mrawr!
Oh, <var>! You're back already? I thought you'd want to stay in Iki Town longer...
Especially right after that great Pok√©mon battle! Ooh, I was just captivated to see my own boygirl fighting in such perfect sync with hiser partner!
Maybe it would be a good idea for you to try that island challenge thing... It's something you can only do in Alola, right?
But right now I've got a date with my bed. I danced my feet off at that festival! Night-night, sweetie. You get some sleep, too!
