Now we're ready to power up the Pinger!
It's actually working... The Pinger is getting a good dose of power!
Tekyu!
Yes! We're getting much more power than on our last try!
Buzzzzzap!
Hm... Electabuzz. It seems like the more power we pump into the Pinger, the bigger Pokémon it attracts. This is amazing, Soffy!
If that's the case, let's give it some more power! That'll definitely summon the Totem Pokémon!
The more Charjabug we connect in a direct line, the greater the electrical current that is generated, and the longer it flows...
So that means—
I've got it, <var>! Actually, I think you've got it already, too. So, my trial will continue to continue!
