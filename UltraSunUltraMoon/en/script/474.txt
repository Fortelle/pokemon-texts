There you are! The Charjabug are all fed and happy!
Zap zap!
Hm? Let's see... I'm only counting six! They're not all here yet.
I'm sorry, <var>, but do you think you could go find the remaining Charjabug? We're only missing three. They should still be eating in that empty lot by the bus station.
You only have <var> Charjabug left, <var>! ItThey should still be eating in the area in front of the bus stop. If you could find itthem, that would be great!
Bzzzzzzrt.
How's it going, <var>? Didja find all those Charjabug?
Oh, seems like Sevenjabug is missing... It always wanders off to strange places. Hm? Oh, we call the nine Charjabug by their nicknames! Onejabug all the way to Ninejabug.
Only Sevenjabug is missing. It always wanders off to strange places.
Jabugabug!
Oh, Sevenjabug, there you are! Thanks for the help in finding it, <var>! Now, we should get back to Sophocles. No doubt he's been craning his neck like an Exeggutor waiting for us!


There's...a Pok√©mon buried here...?
*rustle rustle* *rummage rummage*
You found Molayne's Charjabug!
It looks like something was eating here...
