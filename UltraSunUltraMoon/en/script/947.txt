We've been collecting every last shard of Buginium Z in Alola for Mr. Guzma. All so that Mr. Guzma could be sure to be the strongest bug Pokémon user around!
I hear that Mr. Guzma never got a Z-Power Ring as a sort of handicap, 'cause he's too strong already.
It's an unused fireplace. Pokémon use it as a passage very infrequently.
