This old place is actually a trial site. I can't let you in unless the captain says it's OK.
This old place is actually a trial site. I'd heard you might be coming. Good luck!
Congratulations on clearing your trial! Being able to use Z-Powers has got to be one of the best things a Trainer can achieve!
Congratulations on becoming Alola's first-ever Champion! Use those Z-Powers to reach ever newer heights as a Trainer!
You want to hear something funny? I heard that there's a Pikachu that knows the move Surf! Maybe if you were, like, the best Mantine Surfer ever, you might someday get to meet it!
The Boss was a legend among Mantine Surfers. His partner Pikachu used to ride atop Mantine with him, and that's how it learned to use Surf!
Kraw!
Raw!
Rahaha!
