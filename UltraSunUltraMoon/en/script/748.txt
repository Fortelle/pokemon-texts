Alola is famous for Mantine Surfing! You can enjoy some epic waves here!
What's with that odd-looking duo? Are they some kind of local celebrities or something?
You're not allowed to ride the Mantine until your legs are big and strong, so you can stand up on them. I bet your legs get super strong from all the walking you do on the island challenge!
Hey, they're from Team Skull, that bunch of bullies! I'm not scared of the Grunts, but their boss is supposed to be really scary!
How 'bout you have a ride with Mantine Surf? You can just flow with the wave, but it's important to challenge yourself, too!
The Mantine are all really chill. They don't care if someone's riding them, or even if Pok√©mon called Remoraid cling to them!
Weeeeeeh!
Grbrbrb!
My straw hat got blown away by the wind, and... Well, I chased after it and wound up here.
Everyone seems able to pull off killer moves the moment they climb atop a Mantine... Why do they even keep me as an instructor?
Hey, thanks for always playing with Pyunch! That's the nickname of Pyukumuku. Since nobody needs lessons on Mantine Surf moves, I've started teaching Pyunch instead!
If you fall off during Mantine Surf, don't worry! The Pyukumuku help you float, and I'll fish you up eventually! Oh, I'm kidding! The Mantine will always help you get back up on the wave!
You can Mantine Surf at special Surf Spots! Enjoy surfing with... You guessed it! Mantine!
