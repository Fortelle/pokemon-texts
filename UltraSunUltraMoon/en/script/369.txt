<var>! Alola, alola!
I got curious because I saw the altar go all dark. But I guess you took care of all that, huh?
But I'm not going to let you take all the good parts! I'm a captain, too, you know? So why don't you see if you can beat my trial?
If you're ready to try, just come by my house. It's in Seafolk Village. Or, yeah, I guess you could just come with me... Let me know if you wanna go together.
Hey! So what do you think? You wanna go back home with me?
I do!
Maybe later
Then let's get this show on the road!
Just don't forget, then. Come by my house in Seafolk Village!
