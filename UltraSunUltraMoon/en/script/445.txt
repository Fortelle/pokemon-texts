Who are you...?
It seems you are not a member of Team RR.
...My name is Cyrus.
I would like to ask you one question.
Is this world the new world?
Maybe?
I don't know
I can sense in you the strong desire to protect... something. You have a powerful spirit.
...That must mean this isn't the world I desired.
I used the power of the Pokémon that control time and space to create a perfect world, where the human spirit does not exist.
That was when a great shadow appeared and engulfed me... And brought me to this world.
Is that a Pokédex...? May I have a look?
Zzzt?
Interesting... In this world, even the Pokédex is...
The Rotom Dex wazzz made to help Trainerzzz!
... ... ... ... ... ...
...I see. So you have a spirit, as well.
But it's too late... All too late. I cannot stop now.
I must remove the weak, incomplete human spirit from this world and bring it perfection!
How foolish...
I will not let anyone get in my way...
...Why are you able to create such strong bonds with your Pokémon?
And how are you able to turn those bonds into strength?
Don't you get it? <var> izz kind to all Pokémon!
...I see.
...You need not worry, Rotom. I will not do anything to this world. I believe I shall return to the perfect world I created.
But before that...take this key.
Use it to activate the machine on the wall behind me. That should open the mirror door.
Had I met you sooner...would things have been different for me...?
Do you want to use the Galactic Key?
Let's use it!
The machine has already been activated!
The Galactic Key broke...
