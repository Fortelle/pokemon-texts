Hey there, the Bewear costume show is starting soon! Do you want to watch, too?
Oh dear, that's too bad... Well, maybe when you have more time!
Great! One more customer, coming through! Go on, take a seat! The show's about to begin!
Hello, hello! Welcome to the Bewear costume show!
As I'm sure you know, Bewear may look cute, but they're actually very, very dangerous!
So, in this show, there will be no real Bewear making an appearance! Please relax, and enjoy!
Now, without further delay... Here are our lovely Bewear!
Wow! They look so real!
Alola!
Wear Bewear wear!
Just look at them, ladies and gentlemen! They're more active than usual!
...Huh?
... ... ... ... ... ...
Now, who could be in that third Bewear costume?
Are you a helper Bewear? The more Bewear the merrier!
... ... ... ... ... ...
The new Bewear is motionless...
Ooh, could it be...a real one?
... ... ... ... ... ...
Bewear!!
Eeeeek! It's real!
Everyone beware the Bewear!
We gotta get out of here!
Everyone has ran off in a panic!
Wear, bewear, wear...?
Bewear has its gaze fixed on you...
Wear? Bewear?
Run
Wear!
Bewear!
... ... ... ... ... ... You can't escape!
Weeeaaarrrr!
The menace of Bewear has passed...
*pant pant*... Huh? Where did the Bewear go...?!
Did... Did you...?
Oh, thank you, brave Trainer! Thanks to you, nobody was hurt...
Oh, I'm so relieved now I could cry! How can I ever show my gratitude? Please, would you kindly accept this small token of our thanks to you?
Still, I can't help but wonder what the real Bewear wanted... Maybe it wanted to show us how to properly be a Bewear...?
