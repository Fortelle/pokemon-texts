The hated boss who beats you down and beats you down and never lets up... Yeah. Big bad Guzma is here!
I don't really get you, kid, but at least this is a change of pace. It's not every day someone comes straight to me for a beating!
I'm not here for you
I'm here for the Pokémon
No bone to pick with me, huh? Then it's for Yungoos, I guess. How sweet of you to help out a sad little girl. Tch!
Oh, Yungoos? How sweet of you to help out a sad little girl. Tch!
And you came all the way here just for that, huh? Can't you just watch out for your own Pokémon and stay out of other people's business?!
You're one messed up kid!
You wanna know what I do when some machine messes up? The first thing I do is give it a nice hard smack!
I mean, most of the time I smash it to pieces, but hey, what can you do? Now let's see if I can't fix you!
Guzma! What is wrong with you?!
Yo! Give the Pokémon back to the kid. NOW!
Kew...
Tch!
Eek!
I'm gonna beat you down one of these days! No matter whose help I need to do it...
