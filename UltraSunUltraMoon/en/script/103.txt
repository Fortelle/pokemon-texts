Yes, I see... So this way lies Verdant Cavern... It is one of the places in this land filled with the Blinding One's power... Most certainly worth our investigating!
Yup! The aura levels are really high!
Calm yourself, Zossie. It will be difficult for us to investigate it, though, since we do not use Pokémon of our own... We will have to think of some other way. Perhaps we could use our technology to find a way to control Pokémon...
Maybe I could go in as a trial-goer? Take on the trial and everything? Though I don't have one of those island challenge amulet thingies...
Verdant Cavern... It's showing very high numbers.
It would. In the heart of this cave lies an item that has an undeniable connection to the Blinding One. I certainly would like to investigate this place.
Shall we go in then?
No... It seems that people are not allowed within this Verdant Cavern without specific reason. We should ask the president to arrange for some special accommodations on our behalf. We don't yet have the means to capture Pokémon on our own, after all.
Perhaps we will have to think of some new methods, such as asking some trial-goer to cooperate with our investigations...
