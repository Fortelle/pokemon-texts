Hey! You found the prez yet?
Not yet
You all right there?
Ugh! C'mon, you Grunts! Tell me where the prez is, or else!
Oh, you're still wandering around here?
You better hurry, little tyke, or what you're lookin' for will be gone forever!
Who are you two weirdos? And whaddya mean, gone forever?!
Well, if it isn't the big buffoon himself, Archie!
Hey, careful who you call names, Maxie! I seem to recall you cowering in defeat in front of me!
Hmph, such nonsense. No matter what world we're in, I would never lose to the likes of you.
Ooh, you want me to prove it to you then? C'mon, let's settle this, right here, right now!
As you wish! Let the victor take Alola, and do with it as he pleases!
Agreed!
H-hey! What're y'all talkin' about? This isn't your turf!
Hm...?!
Wh-what's this?!
Huh?! What's goin' on here...
Yo, I got these goons! You head upstairs!
*pant pant* We're not going to...tell you anything!
Even if we did, you wouldn't be able to reach her, anyway! *gasp gasp* I...I can't breathe if you cover my face like that!
*wheeze wheeze* He's right! If you want to get past the mirror, you'll need to get to the second floor, find the card key, and activate the switch! You'll never be able to do it!
Hahahahahahahahaha! Muahahahahahahahahahaha...hah...hah... *gasp gasp* I...I still can't breathe...
...I might not be one to talk, but these dudes are stupid!
*pant pant* I...can't see... can't...throw...my Poké Balls...
Please... Please just... *gasp gasp* Let us have a...Pokémon battle...
If you got time to just stand there chillin', hurry up and get to the prez! Don't worry—anyone who comes through here is gettin' a beatdown!
*gasp gasp wheeze* Please...let me...just... Let me throw my Poké Ball...
*gasp choke* Can't...take...much more... Have mercy...please...
