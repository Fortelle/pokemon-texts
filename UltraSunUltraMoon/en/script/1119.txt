I hope President Lusamine is not in any danger...
It feels so dark and twisted here... I can't imagine this is a good place for the Pokémon!
That "R" symbol... It makes me very uneasy...
Hyyyyyp...
I saw it— Saw it with my own eyes! The mansion transformed into that evil castle in an instant! What technology could cause such a thing?! I want to research it! I MUST research it!
Team Rocket came in and took over everything so quickly. They were like...well, like a rocket.
I need to be the first to get an interview with the leader of Team Rocket! Better start training my Pokémon!
My camcorder got busted in all the excitement! It's all Team Rocket's fault! I'm gonna report on every dirty little secret they have!
At least it seems Team Rocket aren't in the underground lab or the conservation area...
Prrf...
I thought a Janitor might be let into the mansion, but they chased me away—just like that!
Ms. Wicke has been requesting aid from all the islands. Is that how you found out, Champion?
Some more Ultra Wormholes opened up after the press conference... Some new evil presence has come to Alola! I can feel it!
