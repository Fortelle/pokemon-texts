Oh, <var>! Thank you very much for your assistance in saving Aether Paradise!
Mother is in the medical room now... They're running some checks, but it seems she is going to be fine.
Oh, and about Mr. Faba...
Come on, Faba! Put your back into it!
Urrrrgh! Why must I be the one doing such menial, mundane chores?!
Come on, Intern Faba! We don't have all day!
I-Intern?! Please, don't call me by that title!
I don't think he will return to the position of branch chief anytime soon...
Hey! Ms. Wicke! Please, help me just a little!
Oh, right away!
I will see you later!
Aether Paradise is back to business as usual.
And it's all thanks to you, <var>!
I was worried about Mother, and just terrified of those Team Rocket people...
But to be honest, having another adventure with you, <var>... it was a lot of fun.
I really, really am grateful!
When I do my own island challenge, it would be great if I could do it with you, <var>...
... ... ... ... ... ...
But I guess now it's time for me to go! I'll see you again soon!
Oh, and before I forget! Here, take these.

I imagine Team Rainbow Rocket planned to use those as funding. They hid a whole bunch in the president's room. They're all yours!
Hah... That boygirl had quite some talent...
Now...what new world shall I unleash my evil schemes upon...?
