You met the chief, didn't you? He likes it here and decided to live here for a while. Do you want to know why?
Hohoho. Then I'll keep his story secret.
We seafolk have traveled the seas around the world with our houseboats. But the chief had lived on the land just once.
He met a girl in a port town. She was physically very weak. So he would collect rare things all over the world and show them to her.
One year before her passing... he got off his boat, built a hut near her house, and lived there.
The house she lived in was a cute white house right under a big tree. A tree that looked just like the one you can see over there.
He must pine for her whenever he sees that tree. That's what I think...
Well, thank you for listening to this old woman's mumbling...
I'm old now. It may not be a bad idea to give up the boat life and settle down in Poni Island.
