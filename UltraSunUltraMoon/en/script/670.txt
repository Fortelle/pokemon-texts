Boo-hoo-hoo-hoo! Oh-what-oh-what am I to do?!
What's wrong?
Don't cry
My precious widdle Meowth is lost!
It's so very timid and shy, so I'm sure that it must be hiding someplace...
Ohhhh, my poor, poor Meowth! My heart breaks just thinking about you! I want to find you and hug you and love you!
Please! Will you help me find my Meowth?!
Sure
Could I do it later?
I guess... But when you have the time, please come back to help my precious Meowth in its hour of need!
You will help?! Oh, thank you! You're my hero!
Hssss! Mrawrrr!
Meowth is crouched beneath the car and trying to scare you off!
Look it in the eye
Look away from it
Hsss!
Meowth ran away! Now you've got to track it down again...
Hsss! Rwrrr! Hsss!
Meowth is cowering beneath the tree!
Meow meow!
Purr purr!
Mraw...?
Meowth crept out toward you!
Oh! My precious Meowth! Thank goodness you weren't hurt!
Mrawwwrrrrrr!
Oh, Meowth! I'll never let you go again!
Awww, I just love to rub your cheek with mine... You're so soft, and my beard is so scratchy...
Mrawr?! Khssssss!
Meowth looks exhausted after all that loving from its Trainer...
This little rascal is always running off and making me worry! Thank you for helping me find it, though, young trial-goer!
Since you were so speedy and skillful in helping me, I'll be just as quick to reward you! Use this special set of mine to pick up your pace and boost your power in battle!
Shall we head home, Meowth? Once we get there, we can cuddle even more!
Mrawr?! Hsssssssss!!!
Oh, look how happy you are! Ha ha ha! You adorable little rascal!
Mraaawwwwwwrrrrrr!!!
My Meowth loves the shadowy spaces under tires and beneath trees... Oh, where could it have gone...
You're looking for a Meowth? I saw one go dashing toward that car a little while ago...
A Meowth went running right past me just now!
I've never seen a Meowth running like that! What could have got it so worked up?
Is that a Meowth's tail I see over that fence? No, it's probably my imagination, right?
