Wow! A Z-Crystal!
So that is what they call a Z-Crystal! It appears that Alola's mysterious Z-Crystals are received for overcoming trials, is that right?
I suppose it may be admirable to overcome such trials using your own strength and skill... rather than relying on technology, as we do.
I'm Zossie! You're kind of awesome, you know?
Ah. This is when you are supposed to say "Alola" to one another, is it not? I am Dulse.
And we're part of the Ultra Recon Squad, yup! That ball thing you used there... That is some amazing bit of tech! We might just have to borrow that idea!
We're investigating all about Z-Crystals and auras and all kinds of stuff. So I guess we'll probably see you around!
Ho! So she claimed the light of the Z-Crystal as hiser own, with the aid of hiser Pokémon...
The people of Alola overcome these trials willingly to obtain this mysterious power... to gain access to Z-Power. Is that it?
Depending on no one and nothing but yourself... That is a fine aspiration. Quite different from our tendency to use our technology to solve all of our problems.
It is a pleasure to meet you. My name is Soliera.
I am Phyco. Ah, yes! I believe we are expected to greet you with an "Alola." Is that right?
We are investigating the Z-Crystals found here in Alola for our own particular reasons. And I also find those Poké Balls that you use to be most intriguing...
Perhaps we will find reason to work together sometime in the future.
