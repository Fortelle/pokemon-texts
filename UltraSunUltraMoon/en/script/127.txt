Ho!
I have been expecting you. Allow me to properly greet the young adventurers embarking on their island challenge. I am Hala, the kahuna of Melemele Island.
Shall we begin? The final trial here on Melemele Island will be a Pokémon battle against me, the kahuna! It is known as the grand trial!
Your spirit appears to be ready! However, your Pokémon must also be healthy if they are to unleash their full power in battle!
Yes! It seems that both you and your Pokémon are prepared to combine your mental and physical strengths to unleash your full power!
Well, <var>! You have been entrusted with the Sparkling Stone by Tapu Koko! Now show me you and your partner <var>'s full power!
Well, <var>! You have been entrusted with the Sparkling Stone by Tapu Koko! Now show me you and your partner <var> and your team's full power!
Old Hala here will also be going all out! Let the grand trial begin!
...Hmmph!
The results come as no surprise to me. What a fine Trainer...and what fine Pokémon, too!
Tapu Ko-ko-ko!
Ho! And our mighty Tapu Koko agrees!
Hmmph! Perhaps Tapu Koko is hoping that a day may come when you will grow strong enough to battle it as well...
Accept this Z-Crystal! It allows Trainers to share their power with their partner Pokémon!
Observe, <var>. If you wish to use the Fighting-type Z-Power, move your arm like this... then bend your hips like this and pose!
Now then, <var>! With this victory... you have cleared all of the trials of Melemele Island, the first of Alola's islands! The Melemele stamp is proof of your accomplishments. With it, Pokémon up to Lv. 35, even those you received in a trade, will obey you!
The moon in the daytime... The sun at night... Now to see if you can pour your heart into something that cannot be seen but is very much real. As you continue on your island challenge, consider what makes up the people and Pokémon that you meet: both what you can see and what you cannot. You will surely meet Tapu Koko again someday.
