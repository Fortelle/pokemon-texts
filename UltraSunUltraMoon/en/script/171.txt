Great! Now that we've got all the ingredients, we just need...
Sorry to keep you waiting.
How are you, Mallow?
I've brought a Thick Club and a Rare Bone.
And I brought you some Fresh Water and the usual Rocky Helmet.
Thanks, Lana! Thanks, Kiawe! Now we've got everything we need! You're up next, <var>! We're going to cook up a storm and lure out the Totem Pokémon of Lush Jungle!
Let me see what you've got for me...
