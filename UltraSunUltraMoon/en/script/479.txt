Now we're ready to power up the Pinger!
Tekyu!
Yes... It's working... The electricity from the linked Charjabug is moving along the cable...
It's actually working... The Pinger is getting a good dose of power!
Now...the Totem Pokémon should be here any minute!
Bzap!
Ah, of course. Elekid love electricity, too. It must have been tempted out by the Pinger.
We didn't call the Pokémon we wanted, but it seems like the Pinger works just fine. So, what now, Soffy?
Hmm, I think one row of Charjabug isn't giving it enough electricity...
If that's the case, all we need to do is add another circuit!
If my theory is correct, this should let us pump more power into the Pinger! So, my trial will continue, <var>!
