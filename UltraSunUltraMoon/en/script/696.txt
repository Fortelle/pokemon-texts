I really would love to see that Pokémon with my own two eyes, you know...
You know! It's that rare Electric type one. The one that looks like three Pokémon stuck together. Oh, what's its name again...?
It's that one that can even poison Steel-type Pokémon. And only females can evolve into it... Oh, what's its name again?
I've heard it's not even a Dragon type in other regions! You must know the one I mean!
Oooh, but the name... It's on the tip of my tongue, but I can't recall it!
You know the one, though, don't you? I'd love it if you could show me a specimen.
Th-that Pokémon you have there!
That's it... Magneton! That's the name!
That's it... Salazzle! That's the name!
That's it... Exeggutor! That's the name!
This is my first time seeing one in the flesh. Goodness, it really is stuck together, isn't it?
This is my first time seeing one in the flesh. Goodness, that curvaceous form is really rather artistic, wouldn't you say?
This is my first time seeing one in the flesh. Goodness, it's much longer than I expected!
Here's a little thank-you gift!
It was so frustrating to not be able to remember the name. But that's all better thanks to you! I'll remember you the next time I'm stumped!
I feel like my memory has really improved a lot thanks to your help. I appreciate it!
