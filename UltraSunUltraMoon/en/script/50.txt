The kahuna is back! Kahuna Hala has returned!
Our guardian's chosen one is back!
Only one of the strongest Pokémon users in all Alola, yeah!
Have I missed something?
There you are, Kahuna Hala! Was there some kind of trouble?
Ahaha! Just got caught up in the middle of some brawling Rockruff, that's all!
Sorry, Lillie. What were you saying before? For some reason I thought I saw Tapu Koko flying about...
Oh, um... Yes, Kahuna Hala... Nebby got attacked by some Spearow on the Plank Bridge. And <var> here helped protect it.
But the bridge collapsed, and I thought both of them might fall to the bottom of the ravine... And that was when the island's guardian deity swooped in to save them!
Woo! That's something you don't hear every day!
Ho! Although it is said to protect us, our Tapu Koko is a rather fickle creature. Yet our guardian was moved to save you.
Kukui, my boy, I think we have cause to celebrate! Looks like we have a brave and kind new Pokémon Trainer in our midst!

I'm glad to meet you, child. I am Hala, the kahuna of Melemele Island. Welcome to Alola! Young Kukui had told me of your coming. I'm glad we got the chance to meet today.
