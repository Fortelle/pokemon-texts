Necrozma has fallen to the ground, weak and drained of power...
Will you share the light of your Z-Power Ring with Necrozma?
Yes
No
Linooo!
Necrozma disappeared off somewhere...
You found a Z-Crystal that fell from Necrozma...
You obtained the Ultranecrozium Z!
Splendid!
It's been a while, <var>. You must be a formidable Trainer indeed if you are able to get Necrozma as one of your allies.
Good! And this is from me! The Ultra Recon Squad asked me to develop a device that would be able to control Necrozma. But I improved it to my own liking! And now it is a device that makes it possible to draw out even more power from Necrozma!

Yes, in short, it makes it possible for Necrozma to fuse with the Legendary Pokémon Solgaleo! This is the Colress Machine No. 1198, officially dubbed the N-Solarizer!
In addition, this is the Colress Machine No. 1199, officially dubbed the N-Lunarizer! It makes it possible for Necrozma to fuse with the Legendary Pokémon, Lunala!
Ah yes. I have heard in fact that you first met Solgaleo—no, its pre-evolved Cosmog—upon Mahalo Trail.

I believe that a Trainer like you will be able to use both Alola's Legendary Pokémon and the fearsome power of Necrozma properly!
I happen to know quite a bit about Pokémon fusion myself... But that is a different tale. Good luck in your battles!
