Moo-aaarrr!
<var>! You stand back. Old kahuna Hala will take care of this ornery Tauros! Why don't you take a stroll through Hau'oli?
Hah!
There! <var>, I've got this ornery creature calmed again, for now. Want to try giving him a little pat again? That's the only way he'll get used to you.
Come on, <var>! Try showing Tauros a bit of affection!
Poke it on the nose
Touch its forelegs
Grab it by the horns
Hrmmm. Tauros didn't seem to care for that.
Moo-oo-oo. ♪
Maybe old Tauros here can feel your love for Pokémon. He sure seems happy to know you. And yet... It still seems to me like Tauros wants to stretch his legs on his own island challenge! Ha!
What! You want to play tag, now? The Melemele kahuna never loses, friend!
