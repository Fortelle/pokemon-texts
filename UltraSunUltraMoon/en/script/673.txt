There is a bottle on the ground with a faded- looking letter inside of it... Will you open the bottle?
To the person who finds this letter, If you are reading this letter, please find a way to deliver it to my little sister. She lives in Iki Town on Melemele Island.
This place where I am now is really weird and looks unbelievable, but all of the people here have been really nice, so I'm OK. I hope I'll see you again someday! Be safe!                            â€”Your big brother
Ah... On lovely calm days like this one, I always think of my brother... When we were young, he always worked so hard to collect sand from the beach. Where could he be now? What must he be doing?
Oh? Yes? Do you need this old woman for something?
You told the old woman about the letter that you found on the beach...
But that can't be... It was from my older brother? Truly?
... ... ... ... ... ...
It's been so many years since he disappeared, but...but... At least now I know that he was all right. Even if he was far away from me, knowing that he was happy is enough for me...
Thank you for telling me what you found...
I hope this may repay you in some small way. It was my most precious treasure as a child. The sand I gathered with my brother...
And if I could ask just one more favor... If you do happen to find anything else like that letter again, please do deliver it. It might just be an irreplaceable treasure for that person, you see. It has been for me.
Do you want to read the letter in the bottle one more time?
