It just hit me! You...
You're not using Battle Boxes, are you?
Good grief!
If you want to use Battle Boxes, check your Boxes in your PC.
Add Pokémon to a Battle Box, and create a Battle Team. Then you can select a Battle Team instantly whenever you want to battle your friends!
You can set up to six Battle Teams to be used in different situations. That way you can distinguish the team you use for your journey from the special team that you might use just for Battle Royals, for example!
Also, you can have the same Pokémon in different Battle Teams! Please, please use Battle Boxes from your Boxes in your PC.
You use Battle Boxes! Great! I can happily call you my friend. I'll give you something good because you're my friend!
Battle Boxes are great. Let's make the most of them, and make a lot of Pokémon shine!
