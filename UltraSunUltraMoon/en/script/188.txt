Go, Nebby! Use...use Splash!
Pew?
Heh... I was just acting like I was <var>.
You...you always seemed to end up getting hurt, Nebby. Seeing that pained me just as much as if I was the one being hurt. But if I could become as strong as Hau and <var> are... then maybe things would be different...
Pew?
Oh!
Um, oh, <var>. Hello. I feel like it's been a while since we last met. Th-there's a laboratory here that studies the dimensions, did you know? And the professor is waiting to meet you!
How...how were your trials? It must be quite trying to do three in a row.
It was no problem
It was really tough
Goodness, really? It wasn't any trouble for you to tackle all three of Akala Island's trials? I suppose that explains it. The reason you look so content and understood by <var> there, I mean.
I would think so... But still! You made it through all three! I think that explains it. The reason you look so content and understood by <var> there, I mean.
