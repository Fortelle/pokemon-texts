That's a pretty great picture. You and your <var>!
You didn't just beat the captains to get all their petals. You even beat the Totem Pokémon that came to check out the Rainbow Flower we made!
You are just too great, <var>. You're a great Pokémon Trainer! So here you go! A piece of Fairium Z for you!
Watch this real close!
You go like this...and then this. And end up like this! ♪
You've finished all your trials, so the only thing left for you is your grand trial! It'll be little Hapu's first grand trial. That's pretty exciting.
Phew. You have to be one seriously astounding Trainer to outdo little Hapu.
That's amazing how you've made it this far! Pokémon League Champion! Wow... Maybe I should just start making pressed flowers for anyone who manages to become a Champion, rather than all this captaining, huh?
