You sense some kind of presence...
Solgaleo suddenly roared toward the sky!
Lunala suddenly cried toward the sky!
La-liooonaaaa!!!
Mahina-peeeaaa!!!
Another Pok√©mon appeared from somewhere.
It's Cosmog!
Would you like to take Cosmog with you?
Pepew!
You obtained the Lunalium Z that Cosmog was holding!
You obtained the Solganium Z that Cosmog was holding!
It seems you can't take Cosmog with you. Make some space in your party or a Box and speak to it again.
