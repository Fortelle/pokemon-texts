There you are.
Mother, if you disappear, tooâ€”!
Now you worry for me? Fine, Gladion. I will do what I must to put your worries to rest... by demonstrating my strength in battle.
Let's see... Yes, you. <var>. You will battle me. If I can defeat even you, then that should silence Lillie's last objections as well.
Heh heh heh... Oh, <var>, you are strong. You should carry on with your island challenge.
Perhaps I've made you feel uneasy about my ability to handle this task? I will be fine. I won't be alone.
Guzma. With me.
Yes, ma'am...
I am off to defeat Necrozma.
I am off to capture Necrozma.
Wait! Let me go! My partner Null was born to be a beast killer! I've trained it all this time to be able to battle on the other side of that Ultra Wormhole!
You are a sweet boy...
But do not worry. You can leave it all in my hands! Children really would all be much happier... if they'd only listen to the adults around them.
Mother!
Why?!
Nebby... Are you...all right?
N-Nebby...
What is it?
It changed forms... and it's not moving...
Come on. Let's get out of here. Nothing good can happen here.
