Moo-aaarrr!
Whoa there, Tauros!
I've got an idea! How about I set you up so you can ride my Tauros whenever you'd like? No reason why he shouldn't get to enjoy the island challenge, too!
Moo-raaarrr!
I'll take care of all the little things you'll need in order to ride a Pokémon, <var>!
You obtained a Ride Pager!
Why don't you hop on there?
The world looks a bit different from atop a mighty Tauros, eh?
See, <var>. Here in Alola our Pokémon lend us their strength and let us ride about on them!
Let me explain some of the gear I gave you... Your Ride Pager is a tool that lets you summon a Ride Pokémon. According to the instructions, you need only "press the Y Button to turn on your Ride Pager! Use the B Button to dash!"
And your Riding Wear will be the special outfit you wear when riding Pokémon.
Have a little romp around Alola with Tauros here. I'm sure you'll be charmed by him!
When you use your Ride Pager, Ride Pokémon will kindly come running to help you wherever you may be!
