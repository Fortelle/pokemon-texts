This is Aether Paradise. It's actually a VLFS or a "very large floating structure" to you, I suppose. It's all made up of huge blocks stuck together. I guess you could call it a new island, which we created and set to float here in Alola's waves!
We use the motion of the waves to generate electricity to power the whole building.
We get more than just ferry boats in here. We also have things brought in by cargo boat.
There are some things in life you just can't do anything about. You'll be happier if you don't think about them.
Whenever we try to help some Pokémon or another, that Team Skull gets in our way! I've got a real bone to pick with them!
I was working in Driftveil for a while, helping Pokémon that got separated from their Trainers. But I left once things settled down there.
Can't you see I'm in the middle of work here! Get outta here! It's not safe for kids!
We're checking to make sure that no Pokémon have slipped in and come along for the ride. Can't be too sure, when we've got non-native Pokémon like Grimer taking over here in Alola! Invasive species are not to be taken lightly.
Mrrr!
Cha-ahhh!
