Yo, yo, <var>! Gimme that <var>!
Kryuuuu...
Please, stop!
Whatchu lookin' at?! What's this Pokémon need a nice <var> for? I'm just gonna put it to better use, that's all!
You there... Do you think you could help?
You want a piece of me?! I'll show you what happens when you mess with Team Skull!
It's all your fault—just 'cause you wouldn't hand over that <var>!
Kew...
Yo, you got lucky, <var>! Don't count on people to help you next time!
Oh thank goodness... Everything's going to be all right, now.
Kruu!
Oh dear... What's wrong?
It'd make this old lady happy if you'd come back tomorrow, too.
When I woke up this morning, I found a <var> left at my door.
Must be from that Pokémon you saved. Trying to say thank you, I'd suppose. You should keep it. I'm sure it's meant for you.
That Vulpix... Those Team Skull bullies scared it off, and I haven't seen it since... But well, it should know that there are people like you, too. I hope it comes around here again soon.
