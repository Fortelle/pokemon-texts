Yes, <var>? You've found me again. Would you like to attempt my trial once more?
Definitely!
Not yet
Oh, really? I will be waiting, in that case.
Good. Then to review my trial's requirements... I want you to drive the Wishiwashi found in the pools of Brooklet Hill downstream, in order to draw out the Totem Pok√©mon.
Good. Then we should head downstream to meet the totem!
If you're ready, please follow me this way.
