Hi. There's this Pokémon that I'm looking for. I want <var>. Do you have one? Would you trade it for my <var>?
Thank you! I'll be good to your <var>, so please be nice to my <var>!
Wait! That Pokémon isn't <var>. I guess you don't want to trade with me.
Oh, OK. If you change your mind, please come see me. I'll be waiting!
Thank you for trading with me! I really wanted this Pokémon, so I promise to take good care of it!
Sorry! I can't trade with a person who has only one Pokémon.
Hello! You're a Pokémon Trainer, aren't you? Have you caught Spearow? Will you trade it for my Hawlucha?
Thank you, thank you! I'll take good care of your Spearow, so please take good care of my Hawlucha!
Hmm... That is not Spearow... When you can trade, let me know.
I see. If you change your mind, please let me know!
Yay! I'm so happy! I'll take very good care of your Pokémon!
Uh-oh. Sorry. I can't trade with a Trainer who has only one Pokémon.
I have Noibat in case I get in trouble in Brooklet Hill, but if you'd like, please trade it for your Lillipup.
Let's trade!
Huh? That's not Lillipup. If you want to trade with me, speak to me again!
Wha—? You don't want to trade? Let me know when you want to trade with me!
Wow! Lillipup is so cute! Noibat is indescribably cute, too! So please take good care of my Pokémon!
Huh? You have only one Pokémon? I can't trade with you unless you have two.
Do you want my Barboach? It did a great job at Wela Volcano. I don't mind trading it for Tentacool.
I'm so happy! I'll take good care of your Tentacool, so please take good care of my Barboach!
Ten, ten, ten, ten, Tentacool. ♪ What I want is Tentacool!
See you!
Barboach's types are Water and Ground! Grass is its only weakness!
I heard that you can't trade unless you have two Pokémon!
Please trade my Arbok for your Trumbeak!
Bye-bye, Arbok. Come on, Trumbeak.
Argh! I told you that I want Trumbeak!
OK. Maybe next time.
Please give lots of love to my Arbok! I'll take good care of your Trumbeak and make it evolve into Toucannon!
Wherever you are, the rule is the same. You can't trade unless you have at least two Pokémon!
Hey. Do you have Phantump? Trade it for my Phantump if you have one. I know. You must be wondering why I want to trade the same species of Pokémon. I want to see if the rumor about it is true.
Phantump... I heard they were created when spirits possessed rotten tree stumps...
No, no, no! I have something I want to find out by trading Phantump for Phantump!
I'll be waiting!
Whoa! Phantump evolved! So the rumor was true!
Wahaha! Don't be ridiculous! You can't trade when you have only one Pokémon in your party!
Do you wan' a Shellos? I wan' a Granbull.
Thanks. I'll be good to your Granbull, so be nice to my Shellos.
Didn't I tell you that I want Granbull?
It's not that easy to say good-bye to your Pokémon... If you change your mind, come see me.
Shellos look different based on their forms— West Sea and East Sea. But where's the border?
Oh? If you want to trade, at least two Pokémon should be with you.
My Tauros intimidates its opponent with its Intimidate Ability! Let's trade Pokémon! Let's see. I want Bewear!
Both your Bewear and my Tauros will have a new journey!
Hey! What I want is Bewear!
Oh well, if you change your mind, trade Pokémon with me, all right?
I'll conquer the Battle Tree with this Bewear! You, too, get ahead with that Tauros!
Seriously? You can't trade Pokémon unless you have at least two Pokémon!
