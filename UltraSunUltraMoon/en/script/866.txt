We welcome you gladly to the grandiose Hano Grand Hotel!
We welcome you gladly, our great Champion! This is the grandiose Hano Grand Hotel!
I'm one of the Bellhops. Ring the bell and I'll hop up to serve you!
I'm the hotel detective for this establishment. There hasn't been a single incident that I haven't been able to solve! Because there hasn't been a single incident ever reported, in fact...
Salandit's poisonous gas smells as sweet as any flower, but breathe it in and you're done for. I've tried watering it down to use it in perfume, but I'm not having any luck...
Whether it's your golf swing or your battle skills, it's hard to improve without a bit of guidance.

Mowr?
Alola is how we say hello. Alola is how we say farewell. May the love of sun and moon shine upon you!
The touch of the Alola breeze feels like being wrapped in kindness. Wait, and feel it blow over you...
Alola is the land where I was born. Alola is the home I was born into. Welcome, and please feel at home as well!
A good Pokémon will listen to what others think around it and then discover its own mind. The same goes for a good woman, too.
Listen, kid: If you don't throw common sense out the window sometimes, you'll never be able to discover anything new. Try everything out: different Abilities, moves, items... That's how you make a breakthrough!
I can't make any recommendations on behalf of the hotel, but I can tell you this... Whatever type of Pokémon that your Pokémon are weak to, you should have other Pokémon on your team that are effective against that type!
The owner of the Hano Grand Resort is a great golf fan. And his daughter, Miss Kahili, is a world-class Golfer herself! And a real strong Trainer, too.
Would you look at this thing? It totally looks like an Oddish, right?
