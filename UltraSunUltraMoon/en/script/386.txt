You did an admirable job completing Mina's trial.
Meaning...
Meaning?
Grand trial time?
Yes, it is time for your grand trial! I'll await your arrival on Exeggutor Island.
So the time has come for you to wrap up your island challenge.
I even had an all-out battle against Hau, holding nothing at all back... and I was defeated in spectacular fashion!
The island challenge helps you all grow, and you in turn will help Alola keep changing... I can't imagine anything more delightful!
