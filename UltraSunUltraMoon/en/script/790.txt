I'm busy thinking about what kind of city we should make our Hau'oli into. It's got to be convenient for the people living here. And for the Pokémon living here, too!
It's one of the jobs of City Hall to maintain the roads and make sure there is space for any Ride Pokémon to travel along them, too.
Bzz bzz!
Keeping our city clean and supporting the folks who work at the Pokémon Center... Those are all things that City Hall handles, too.
Here. This is medicine for Pokémon. Take it with you for your travels.
Children and Pokémon should always be full of energy. That's the way they're meant to be!
Pu pu pu...
Getting documents from City Hall is such a convoluted process that it feels rather like you're playing some kind of elaborate game.
Yes, yes, I'll need some identification, please. Do you have a Trainer Passport? Oh! So you're <var>! Yes, I remember preparing your Trainer Passport for you, of course. Professor Kukui asked me to. You came from Kanto, didn't you? Is it true that Meowth from Kanto are different from the Meowth here in Alola?
Welcome, Champion! You've become a true Alolan now!
We're going to get married! We're here to apply for our marriage license!
We're going to have a lively home, together with our Gastly, too!
