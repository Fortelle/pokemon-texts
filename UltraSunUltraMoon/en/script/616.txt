Oooh, that sounds lovely!
I'm going to take a break, too!
My usual, please!
Comin' right up.
Thank you!
Ahhhh!
Oh, excuse me... But hey, I think I should get to take a little break sometimes, too. Right?
You should!
Should you?
Right! I get just as tired as the Pokémon do!
Look, I know the Pokémon get tired... But I do, too!
The longer you keep on walking, the farther you'll get, right? And the better you rest up, the longer you'll be able to keep on walking.
I have to say... Seeing injured Pokémon all the time does slowly wear me down, bit by bit...
But it's precisely because I want to make them all feel better that I take the time to properly relax and recharge my batteries.
Here. A little secret between you and me.
And once I duck back around behind my counter, I will be all business again. You'll see!
You got some Poké Beans!
