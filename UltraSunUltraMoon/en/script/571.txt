You there! Do you know of the Pokémon called Genesect?
I do!
I don't
Then I have no choice but to admit that you are all I would expect you to be!
Then allow me to inform you!
Genesect is a Pokémon that lived 300 million years ago. Then an organization called Team Plasma modified it, attaching a cannon to its back.
The cannon's abilities could be activated using certain drives created by the scientists in the P2 Laboratory. I think that you might be able to use them as they should be used.
Simply believing in your Pokémon will not guarantee that you can do everything you want. But there are many things that are guaranteed to fail if you do not believe in them. It is the trust between a Trainer and a Pokémon alone that can overcome those hurdles!
You there! You should know that there is a battle facility on Poni Island called the Battle Tree. I look forward to seeing what kinds of Trainers and Pokémon I can encounter there!
You there! You know that there is a battle facility on Poni Island called the Battle Tree, don't you? I look forward to seeing what kinds of battles you might have there!
