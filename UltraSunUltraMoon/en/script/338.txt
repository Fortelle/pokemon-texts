Hah... Here we are at Exeggutor Island! I heard that this place used to be a trial site, though that was a long time ago now.
Hm? Looks like the fellows are even more worked up than usual. Eh. But they're always a noisy bunch. It's probably fine.
You go on. Good luck!
You want to go back to Poni Island?
Fair enough. Let's be going.
I'll wait around for you then.
Let's go find that flute! Right? Trainers really can go anywhere as long as they have their Pok√©mon, can't they? I think I'm beginning to understand the appeal.
You want to head back to Exeggutor Island?
You wanna go to Exeggutor Island, that perfect paradise for Exeggutor?
Well, all right then. Let's be going!
Fair enough. Maybe next time!
