A trial-goer, huh? And why would you be coming to a lonely odd place like this?
I've gotta get Team Skull
I need a Ride Pokémon
Uh-huh... I see you've got your reasons.
Then...I'll take you on. Tell me. Uncle Grimsley is going to flip a coin. Will it be heads or tails?
Heads
Tails
Neither
...Astonishing. You just took a stab, like some kind of prophet. Right now, you and your Pokémon are shining brilliantly.
...Astonishing. I had indeed been planning to have Skarmory snatch it out of the air as it spun in the sky.
A loss is a loss. I'll give you Sharpedo's info for your Ride Pager then. Ride it to victory.
Sharpedo was registered to your Ride Pager!
Maybe you don't need to hear this from me, but I'm going to tell you anyway. If you press [0xE001] while riding on Sharpedo there, it'll jet forward and smash through rocks like those ones there.
And here's a bit more unwanted advice. Po Town lies at the other end of Route 16 here. But it's thoroughly occupied by Team Skull. You shouldn't go there unless you want trouble.
If somebody wins a battle, then without doubt, someone else has lost the battle. That's the way of battle. I hope I might battle you someday.
Sometimes you have to lay everything on the line in life, and risk it all... When I did that, though, I'm afraid I lost. I took to walking along the shore in my despair. And before I even noticed what I was doing, I ended up riding Alola's waves together with Sharpedo and Mantine... That's right... The role I'm meant to play now is to teach others what it means to ride...
Champion, huh... That's a title I haven't heard in a while. Allow me to offer my congratulations as a former member of the Unova region's own Elite Four... when we meet at Poni Island's Battle Tree!
