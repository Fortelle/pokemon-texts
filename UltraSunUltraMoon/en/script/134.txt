Um... I was hoping to ask a favor of you, <var>. If that's all right?
Sure!
What is it?
You see... Nebby is... Its real home is far away from here. And I want to help it get home.
It's like I told you before... Nebby saved my life once when I was in trouble. Now I want to save it!
I feel like there's not much I can do on my own, since I'm not a Pok√©mon Trainer... But if I had a real Trainer like you helping me, <var>, then maybe...
But I probably shouldn't ask a near stranger to help, right? I know it's just my own wish and it has nothing to do with you...
Of course I'll help!
Yeah, I don't know...
Oh, thank you so much. I'm so glad! I really didn't know what else to do!
Then, I suppose... The two of us will get to see one another on Akala Island next, too!
Pew!
I...I understand. Um, but if you ever do learn anything that you think might help Nebby get home... I'd really appreciate it if you could tell me. I'll do my best to look for clues on Akala Island on my own. And maybe I'll see you there.
Pew...
