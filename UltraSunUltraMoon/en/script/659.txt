A wedding is about to start! I want you to celebrate with us!
Oh. That's too bad!
Thank you. It starts now!
Here they come, the bride and the groom.
Here comes the bride, all dressed in white! â™ª
Pika pika!
Pikanchi!
*squeak* So beautiful! Right, honey?
Pikamie... *sob*
Always be nice to each other... Ah...well...you may kiss the bride.
Pika!
Pika!
Chu!
Congratulations!
Yay! That was perfect!
Hehehe. That was our play wedding! It was fun, right?!
Here's your wedding favor...or whatever you call it! Thanks for celebrating with us!
I wonder if I'll be happily married someday...
