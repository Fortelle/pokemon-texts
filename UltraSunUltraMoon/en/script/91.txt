Yo, Trainer. Look what you've got!
You lucky kid. If you've got a Poké Finder, then I guess I'll give you a little tip.
See that spot where the wall is cracked? That's a photo spot right there.
Look at that! Your Rotom there is trying to tell you, too! Give him a tap!
You can't just let a chance like this go by! Come on, fire up that Poké Finder!
I hear it's best to try to photograph Pokémon head on and zoomed in as close as possible!
If you want to know more about the Poké Finder, well, just keep on taking tons of pictures!
