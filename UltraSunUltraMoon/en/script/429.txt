Do you have any ideas on how to get Team Rocket out of here, <var>?
The Battle Agency!
Other people's Pokémon!
The Battle Agency...? Oh, of course!
Other people's Pokémon...? Oh, right, of course!
If we use the Battle Agency rules, we can use other people's Pokémon to battle! It doesn't matter if we can't use our own!
Just a sec...
Using my admin rights to access the debug features... Rebooting the reception program...
I've made it so we can use the Battle Agency now, too...
I wish there was more I could do...but I can't even access my full admin rights...
I need you to defeat Team Rocket using the Battle Agency, <var>! I'll try and get back complete admin access while you keep them busy!
