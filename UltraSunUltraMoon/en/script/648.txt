N-no, I knew I couldn't do this...
Are you OK?!
What's wrong?
Huh? Oh... Well, you see, my dad gave me a Dewpider the other day... But well, y'see... I really, really can't stand Dewpider!



I know this isn't good, but...
De-dew...
Dewpider is looking dejectedly at the girl...
Well, 'cause! It's exactly like my dad!
My dad's always drenched in sweat, no matter where he goes or what he does...
And so is Dewpider! I am so done with sweat being splattered everywhere!
Dew-dew-dew!
Dewpider shook its body, and water droplets glistened in the light...
See? See?! When it shakes its head, it splashes sweat around, just like Dad! How am I supposed to cope with this?!
Have a battle with it
Join forces
What? Me and Dewpider...together...? No way... That could be a great idea!
If we join forces and have a battle together, I bet it'll help create a bond between us!
I'll do my best!
Hey, since you're already here, do you think you could be my opponent?
Sure!
Maybe later!
Thanks! Well then...c'mon, Dewpider! Let's do this!
OK! But you promise you'll come back, right? I'll be waiting!
Oh man... I'm about to cry... Thanks so much for putting up with me. I know I must have sounded real selfish! Here, this is for you!
All I wanted was to be able to battle like you and your Pokémon did, like a great team. I wanted to become an awesome team with Dewpider. I honestly felt that!
Dew-dew!
Dewpider... You were really beautiful while you were fighting!
I'm just so touched!!
My daughter! And Dewpider! Getting along so wonderfully! It makes a man want to cry! *sob sob*
Every time the Hiker moves, water droplets splatter the area.
But they're definitely not tears...
Wh-why are you here, Dad?! Come on—we gotta run, Dewpider!
Haaahahahahaha! No need to be embarrassed, my dear daughter!
But if it's a game of tag that you want, you'll find out I'm no Slowpoke! Here I come!
