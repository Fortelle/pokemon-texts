What do you want?
Hey hey, what's your deal? I was literally about to buy that! If you got a problem, you're gonna have to battle me!
Yeah, I got a problem!
Nah, no problem
All right, see ya.
All right, here I come!
Hey, what's your deal? If I give you my pocket money, how am I supposed to buy what I want?! You should buy this Strange Souvenir. I'll literally sell it to you for $100!
I'll literally buy it!
Literally not interested
Wow, what a letdown!
Wow, you literally can't even afford it!
Wow, thanks a lot! Just $100 is all I need to get whatever my heart desires!
Hey, y'know that Strange Souvenir? I hear that it's modeled after a guardian deity that lives deep in the desert on Ula'ula Island.
