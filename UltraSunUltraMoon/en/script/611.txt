An old photo dropped out from between the pages...
You picked up an old photograph!
The old photograph shows a girl, a Mudsdale, and a garden.
Oh...a photo. Maybe I can find out who it belongs to by checking who borrowed the book. Here, I'll hold on to the photo for you.
You handed over the old photograph.
Mu-hiiiiiin!
Mudsdale is looking at you intently...
Oh, you're the one who found the photo at Malie Library, right? One of the staff there let me know about it, and about you finding it.
Do you see, Mudsdale? That's the two of us in the photo, back when I was young.
Ni-hiiiiiiiin!
Oh, this brings back memories...
Mu-hiiiiiin!
Mudsdale, calm down!
Muhiin...
It must be so frustrating to keep losing... I know it makes you furious. But don't worry, I'll always be with you, OK? We'll always be together...
Let's train hard and do our best to beat the young kahuna's grand trial.
Mudsdale and I have been together since then... And before I knew it, Hapu came along as well.
Although, it seems Hapu has made friends other than Mudsdale, too.
I am very grateful for that... This Heart Scale is a symbol of my thanks.
