<var>... I'm sorry... I ended up getting lost, yet again...
I wandered around completely lost until I ducked into the apparel shop... And then I saw this outfit, and they said it was the last one they had in stock, so I bought it... Even though I don't think I'd ever have the guts to wear an outfit like it... Hah...
Pew...
But the woman working at the store did tell me where to find the library! So I guess you could say it was all for the best. ...Though the library was actually right past the apparel store, if I'd just kept going.
Ne-e-eh!
Yeek?!
<var>. Been a while, friend.
Looks like your island challenge is coming along favorably. That must be pleasing to the tapu.

So, <var>, who might this be?
Oh! Hello... My name is Lillie.
My apologies if Mudsdale spooked you just now. Doesn't seem like you're a trial-goer. What are you up to?
Oh. I'm actually, um, studying the tapu's ruins. For...various reasons of my own.

Well, that's some fine initiative. I'd be happy to show you the way whenever you'd like to go. My Mudsdale here is as sturdy as all get-out. She can easily carry two.
Thank you for your offer.
Shall we check out Malie Library first though, since we're here?
