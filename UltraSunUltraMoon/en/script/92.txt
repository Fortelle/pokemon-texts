<var>, Hau... Did you visit the tourist bureau? How was it?
We got hiser Rotom Dex upgraded! Now it can take pictures, too!
What a wonderful helper you are, Rotom!
*flash*
Huh?
Ahahaha! What was that for, Rotom? Go and put that little trickster back in your Bag, <var>, and follow me! Enough feasting for the eyes... It's time we take care of our stomachs!
Maybe Rotom wanted to get your attention, because it wants to take photos with you. I think I'll go stop by the apparel shop to do some shopping of my own...
