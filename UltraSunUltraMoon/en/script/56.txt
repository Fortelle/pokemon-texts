Yeah, over here!
So you know that wild Pokémon will sometimes jump out at you in the tall grass, yeah?
Now that you've got <var> there, you can not only fight wild Pokémon, yeah... you can also try to catch 'em. Woo!
I'm going to show you how to catch a wild Pokémon, all right? Keep your eyes on the prize!

Wild Pokémon do sometimes attack people if they get close, but catch 'em and they'll join your team and be a great help to you, yeah!
And if your Pokémon get all tuckered out, you can always head home and rest up a bit, yeah?
Here're some Poké Balls and Potions to get you started out.
Why don't you have a little adventure of your own on the way to Iki Town, yeah? Take good care of <var>, <var>!
