Hey, hi there! You look like a traveling Trainer! Alola is so nice and warm. It's totally the best, isn't it?
Kaw!
I'm a traveling songwriter, you see. Being here with my cute bird Pokémon at a resort like this one is just what I needed to relax and come up with some new tunes. ♪
*sigh* I really don't want to go home.
Kaw...
Just kidding! Hahahah! I was totally messing with you! Oh, I know! Since you stopped by to talk to me and all, why don't you battle me and my bird Pokémon before you go?
Have a battle against me and my bird Pokémon!
For sure!
Maybe later
Oh, what a shame! I'll be here for a while, so come back if you change your mind!
Thanks! Then let's do this! No need to hold back when facing me!
Phew! You are STRONG! That was surprising! Maybe I was a bit hasty challenging you like that. I don't think you're any old Trainer! Don't you think, Kaw?
Kaw!
Oh! Hey, if you'd like, why don't you have your Pokémon hold on to this Metronome? It could make your moves even stronger!
Thanks for the fun battle! It'll be a great memento of my journey!
Musical melodies and natural sounds are good for health, too, you know? It's even nicer to listen to them while jogging along the beach!
Kiaw! ♪
