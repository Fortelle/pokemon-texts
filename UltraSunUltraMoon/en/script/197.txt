Oh?! A trial-going Trainer, you are?
Looker is my name. I travel the world, and many lands do I visit for... my own private reasons.
Alola is a nice place and so very peaceful. Most ideal for a vacancy. I was just in Konikoni City, where I got a most unusual stone at Ms. Olivia's shop!
No one here is so terrible as to try to create a new world...or liberate all Pokémon from their Trainers. Yes, peaceful indeed...
Though concerns I have about those reported sightings of the infamous Pokémon mafia...
Ah! Forgive me for keeping you. I will give you this Thunder Stone if you forgive my rudeness. I bought three without thinking!
Do have a good adventure, my trial-going young Trainer friend!
