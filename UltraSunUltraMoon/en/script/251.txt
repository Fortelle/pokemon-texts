Congratulations on clearing your trial! And you, Sophocles. You did well as captain.
I was really nervous...
Don't you worry. I'm sure that I made the right choice in naming you captain. Even if you are my cousin.
Usually it's the island kahuna who appoints the captains. But there are some, er, unusual circumstances here on Ula'ula.
So somehow I ended up captain...
But you were really great, <var>.
Maybe you should invite himer to check out the Battle Agency in that case!
Big Mo! You're a genius! That's a marvelous idea!
<var>! Come with me to one of Festival Plaza's most unique facilities: the Battle Agency!
You kids have a good time!

I see... Then let me reward you!
This is one of the Z-Crystals that I collected long ago during my own island challenge to prove my strength and that of my Pok√©mon. So it seems fitting that it go from me to you. Take it, and use it well.
And if we're done here, <var>... Could I ask you to do a favor for me? Professor Kukui forgot this.
He said he would be going back to Malie Garden. Could you take it to him?
Maybe next time we can battle...
