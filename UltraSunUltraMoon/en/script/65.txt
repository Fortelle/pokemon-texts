The island challenge Kukui spoke of... It is a journey to overcome your own limitations, as you travel the far corners of Alola and meet with others along the path.
It is the great adventure that children in the Alola region embark upon, along with their Pok√©mon, once they reach 11 years of age!
Allow me to give you both the island challenge amulets you will need.
Awesome! Thanks, Tutu!
I'm gonna make it through the island challenge to try to become an island challenge champion!
There is one for you as well, <var>. Please do give the island challenge a try.
Yeah, doing the island challenge is the best way to really get to know Alola!
