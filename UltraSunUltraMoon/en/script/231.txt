<var>!
What's going on? Some Team Skull punks just ran past me going in the other direction, yeah? I sure wish they'd challenge the League instead of getting up to no good all the time...
The League?
Challenge what?
Ho-ho! You'll find out soon enough! Just you wait, cousin.
But first things first. If you want to head up Mount Hokulani, we should take the bus. It'll blast us up there to the top, yeah, as quick as a Sky Uppercut!
Do me a favor and go check out the bus stop to see when the next one is coming, would you?
