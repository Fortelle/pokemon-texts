What do you think you're doing?! Stop it! Stop it right now!
For real, girl?! Your bag was moving! Right in front of my eyes! And I'm just supposed to ignore that?!
If you've got some rare Pokémon in there, I'm gonna have to take it and make some cash! Even if it's not that rare of a Pokémon, I bet I could still get paid, yo.
<var>!
Oh, so we're following that script, are we? A Trainer dashes forward to save the girl, huh? I'm not gonna let you be the hero in this scene!
When I saw that adorable Drowzee, that was enough for me! Later!

Phew... Thank you, <var>...
I just wanted to go for a stroll on my own, to see what it must feel like to be a Trainer... So Hapu and I went our separate ways... but then Nebby tried to get out of my bag...
Didn't you! Go on, you little troublemaker... You'd better thank <var>, too!
Pew!
Oh, and...um. When I was out shopping, I kept thinking about how I wanted to be some help to you during your island challenge...and then I saw these.
I bought them without even thinking!
