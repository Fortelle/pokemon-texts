Moo! Moo! I'm talkin' to you! Moomoo Milk, 'cause I'm too busy to chew! Yo! Yo! I wanna drink it down! I want Moomoo Milk, and I want it now!
Hey look now—what we got here? I'm gonna make this kid run away in fear! No more drinks at the café for you! They'll all be gone when Team Skull rolls through!
You wanna come to the café, you better come correct! My Pokémon skills, you have to respect!
Let's do this, yo!
No way, yo!
Yo! Yo! Old café dude! Bring the Moomoo Milk, or I'll hafta get rude! Bring me all the milk you have in the store! Then go to Paniola Ranch and get me some more!
*gluuuuurrrgh*
Ugh... My belly...sounds like it's using Rumble...
Hey, yo, kid, my payback will be vicious! But at least for now, this Moomoo Milk is delicious!
*grrrrrrmmmmmgh*
Drink too much of anything, even Moomoo Milk, and this is what happens... You may be feeling a bit put off after all that, but here's some Moomoo Milk for you, too.
Even Pokémon know better than to guzzle milk like that when they're already healthy.
