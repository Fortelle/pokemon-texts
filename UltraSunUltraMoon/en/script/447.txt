You must be the intruder I keep hearing about.
I am Lysandre.
I had triggered my ultimate weapon to wipe out all the foolsâ€”everyone except Team Flare... But at that moment, a bright light swallowed me and I wandered into this world.
No matter. My purpose remains the same. Which world I'm in is not important. The only way to create a world where people live in beauty, a world without conflict or theft...
Behind me, you see two buttons.
One will open the path for you, and help you move forward...
The other will trigger my ultimate weapon, and destroy all that there is in this world!
...So, make your choice. I believe being a chosen one means you have the potential to change the future! Whether we activate the ultimate weapon or leave it safely underground will rest upon if you actually have this potential or not.
Do you want to press the blue button?
You pressed the blue button!
Do you want to press the red button?
You pressed the red button!
The button has already been pressed.
... ... ... ... ... ...
Unfortunately... You are not a chosen one!
You will destroy the world you tried to protect, by your own hand!
However... There is still time before my ultimate weapon is fully activated.
Press the other button before it fires, and you will be able to stop it.
...Of course, I refuse to allow that. So, I will keep you busy for a moment.
The future you want, or the future I want...
Let us see which one is more deserving, shall we?
The strength to protect, huh? ...Very well. Go on, press the button.
You have stopped my ultimate weapon, and also you have taken one step more toward your goal.
Maybe...if my world had a Trainer like you, the path I chose could have been different... No! Nothing can change me now! If there is a path to creating a beautiful world, then that is the path I must take! Even if it means I can only save a handful of the old world!
