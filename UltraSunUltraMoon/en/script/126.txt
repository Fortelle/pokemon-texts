I'm lookin' forward to seeing what moves you and your Pokémon will pour your soul into... now that you've gone and cleared your first trial, <var>!
It's true... I'm not a Trainer, so I'm sure I don't really understand how hard it must have been... but even I think it's a great achievement.
Pew!
Yes, yes... We all know how you feel! But stay inside your bag, please!
The Melemele kahuna is strong, cousin! He's a Trainer who can use Fighting-type Pokémon to the fullest, yeah. Might not be a bad idea to work on those Flying- or Psychic-type moves!
