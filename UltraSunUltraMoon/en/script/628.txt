So this is Aether Paradise... A fine facility you have here, Madam President!
I... ... ...
Is something...the matter?
N-no, nothing... You're here for...a tour today?
Yes! Please call me Mohn. I operate a series of islands known as Poké Pelago, where we take care of Pokémon. But nothing comes close to the care offered at Aether Paradise, after all!
Hey there, <var>! Your Pokémon enjoy Poké Pelago, don't they?
Sure do!
Well, uh...
Ha! OK! Sorry about that! I suppose I put you on the spot there.
Oops! I guess I shouldn't put you on the spot when we're right in front of the president! I don't expect you to pick sides or anything!
This is fascinating, though... I let the Pokémon mostly do as they please back at Poké Pelago, so I'm not sure how much I can apply of what you do here at Aether Paradise... But it's a fine facility indeed!
Heh heh... Is that so? Well, Aether Paradise is primarily designed for Pokémon conservation efforts, after all.
Though...
Though...?
No matter how hard we might work to heal a Pokémon, in the end, it may simply end up stuck in some PC Box somewhere, depending on the whims of its Trainer. Sometimes I can't help but think on that...
I see... It's true that each Trainer does end up deciding what to do with the Pokémon they catch... I suppose I'll just have to find more islands, so I can expand Poké Pelago and care for even more boxed Pokémon there!
When that time comes, I do hope that we might be able to work together, ma'am.
Well, this has been a stimulating visit indeed! Thank you very much for your time, ma'am.
Just...one last question...
Is this... Is this your first time to visit Aether Paradise?
Indeed it is. Why do you ask?
No, no reason... Don't let me keep you any longer. And thank you for coming.
Until we meet again, then!
Are you sure? About leaving things like that?
Yes.
After all, the way he smiles now... It's quite lovely, don't you think?
