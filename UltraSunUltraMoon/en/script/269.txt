Oh no! The Pokémon spotted you!
Let'zzz see here... Lookzzz like you're supposed to try to find a Pokémon and snap a shot of 'em with that Poké Finder, right? Zz-zz-zzt!
Catching the right shot can be tough, huh? Try to catch a shot of your subject zzzoomed in and right in the center of the viewfinder!
Looks like some of the Pokémon in thizzz place like to play hide-and-seek, zzz-zzt! Try to catch sight of 'em with your Poké Finder, then snap a shot when you've got them all zzzoomed in and centered in the frame!
...Who are you?
Acerola?
I'm <var>?
Oh... Never mind that.
Looks like you're done with the trial, right? We should hurry up and leave this place.
I'm not done yet
