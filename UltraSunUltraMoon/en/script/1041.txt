There are all kinds of art collections lined up, and all the paintings in them are by Mina.
The floor is covered with art supplies!
Once that daughter of ours starts focusing on painting, there's no telling how much food she'll stuff her face with! She's like a bottomless pit!
Hah hah! Did you enjoy Mina's trial, young boygirl? At first, all she wanted to make people do was draw a sketch of Ribombee, you know!
It was this Snubbull here that first set our girl down the path to becoming a serious artist. When she showed Snubbull a picture she'd drawn of it, this little fellow chewed that drawing to shreds in its delight! But Mina misunderstood and thought that Snubbull had torn it up because it was bad...
Come to think of it, our dear Mina still has that flower Snubbull brought her. She's made it into a pressed flower and keeps it as her treasure!
Buuu...
