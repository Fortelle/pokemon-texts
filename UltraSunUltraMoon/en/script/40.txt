So you went with <var>! Woo, what a fine-looking team you two are!
Now that you can have Pokémon battles, you're what we call a Pokémon Trainer! Here's a Poké Ball for <var>, too. It should feel nice and cozy in there.



All right! Then let's get going up to Iki Town, <var>. Woo! Time to meet the Island Kahuna!
Island Kahuna?!
But why?!
Truth is, that partner <var> of yours is a gift from the kahuna, not me. So let's go show it off and say a proper thank- you, cousin. It may not be the only gift you get!
In case you hadn't heard, the kahunas are all crazy-strong Pokémon Trainers. Be careful about getting into a battle with one!
Iki Town is right up here!
Get <var> there in that Poké Ball I gave you!
Watch it, cuz! It's dangerous to get too close to a Pokémon while it's using one of its moves!
Ruff!
We can win this! We can win this! Just a little bit more!
Meowth, use Scratch!
Snarrrr!
Nyahhh!
You win a Pokémon battle when the other Pokémon is all outta energy... When its HP hits zero, in other words!
If you happen to pick up a Potion anywhere, use it on your Pokémon when it's low on HP... and it'll be feeling better before you know it!
