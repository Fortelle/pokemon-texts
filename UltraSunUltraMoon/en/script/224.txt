I heard that they serve tea somewhere here in Malie Garden... I'll start my search from the bridge here. Why don't you start around the edge of the garden?
Ho! Professor Kukui!
Hey there! What's going on with you two? Your eyes are shining extra bright today. Did something big happen?
It sure did!
Only something AMAZING!
Professor! Professor! You gotta hear this! An Ultra Wormhole opened up, like, right in front of us, and there really are Ultra Beasts in there! And aliens from other worlds, too! You've gotta tell Professor Burnet, too!
Woo! You got to see the Ultra Wormhole and an Ultra Beast? And folks from another world?! That IS amazing, oh yeah! Sounds like an even better reason to train hard, yeah, on your island challenge!
Maybe someday we'll all be able to go through the Ultra Wormhole!
All right! Your next trial is up on Mount Hokulani! You can catch the bus to get there. Just head to the bus stop on Route 10, yeah?
You guys can go ahead without me, Professor. I've got a hot date with a malasada shop! I'm gonna get my Pok√©mon some treats so they'll really start to like me!
Roger that, good buddy! I'll be waiting at the bus stop, <var>, whenever you're ready to go!
Hey, <var>, did you know?
Of course
Know what?
I haven't even finished the question yet.
There's an observatory up on Mount Hokulani! And you do know what it is they do at an observatory, right? Hope you do, 'cause I sure as heck don't.
Now I'm out!
