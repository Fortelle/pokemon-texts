Aether Paradise is a safe haven for all Pokémon. For this reason, the use of Poké Balls is strictly forbidden within the conservation area.
Wow!
We keep Pokémon that have been targeted by Team Skull here...
And we also try to support Pokémon that need a little extra protection. Like Corsola, for example. They are quite terribly overhunted by a Pokémon called Mareanie.
I hope you don't mind if I read a passage from my old Pokédex. I traveled through Kanto before, when I was younger, you see.
"Corsola. "In Alola, where their natural enemies Mareanie are plentiful, many Corsola have stubby branches on their heads."
Yeah. My gramps is always saying that nature's got its cruel side, sure as it gives us blessings.
But can the Aether Foundation really protect all the Pokémon that're out there?
Nature does have its own balance, of course. It can be difficult to judge just how much we humans should try to affect that, can't it?
That's pretty amazing! The Aether Foundation seems awesome. But why'd you bother setting up a branch in a place like Alola?!
I couldn't say... It's hard to know for sure what our president is thinking sometimes.
If you'd like to meet President Lusamine, she should be here in the conservation area now.
