Yo, yo, yo, check it! Whenever, wherever we meet you, Team Skull don't even greet you!
So, Cap, just give up the Pokémon, yo.
So we meet again. Yes, that's right. It's me, Captain Ilima.
Have you been searching out my Totem Stickers?
What, what?! Why you trying to act hard when we're already hard as bone out here, homie?
Yo, let's check these fools.
Oh my... How terrifying...
Only thieves steal people's Pokémon. I won't stand for it. <var>, wasn't it? I'll ask you to take care of that one. I'll get rid of this one.


Yo, check how I change the game with my mad Pokémon skills!
No fair! I was playing a different game!
Let's get up out this port, B! Nobody has to know about this! We don't need your wack Pokémon anyway, Ilima!
Again? Oh my... How terrifying...
