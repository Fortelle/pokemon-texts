The space here suddenly became all twisted, and then the programming of the Plaza was rewritten! That's why the castle looks so...
Creepy...
Cool!
You think? It looks so menacing, like where a final boss would live... I think it looks kinda cool!
Oh, you get it, <var>! Yeah, the way it's so dark and menacing... Whoever did this certainly has cool tastes in architecture!
Still, they broke through my impenetrable security system, even if they did take advantage of a system malfunction. And they've taken complete control of Festival Plaza... Be carefulâ€”these guys know what they're doing!
Please, <var>! You've got to help me take back Festival Plaza!
Thanks! I knew I could count on you!
P-please, don't say that... I really need your help right now, <var>...
I'm glad that you're with me, <var>. You're the Champion, after all!
W-well... Let's go then... *gulp*
