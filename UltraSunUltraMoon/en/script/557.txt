Ho! You and <var> are doing the island challenge! Great! Allow me to give you a Berry, then.
Oran Berries can restore some of a Pokémon's HP for them. You can feed a Berry to a Pokémon, or let one hold a Berry and they'll eat it when they need it.
By the way, young one. Are you interested in becoming a Berry master?
You look quite promising. All right. First of all, get a Persim Berry!
Oho? Are you being shy? If you want to become a Berry master, don't be shy. Just talk to me.


Let me see. Did you get a Persim Berry?
Whoa! You have a Persim Berry! I don't know if you picked it from a Berry tree or your Pokémon had it, but that's a great start to becoming a Berry master! I'll offer this as a reward.
A Persim Berry heals confusion! A Pecha Berry heals poison status! And a Sitrus Berry restores more HP than an Oran Berry!
Alola is great! You can get plenty of Berries without planting Berries in a Berry field! But some Pokémon gather around trees trying to get Berries as well!
Mufufu! If you get a Persim Berry, please show it to me.
If you're ever looking for more Berries, you won't have to look Berry hard! Wa ha ha ha! Berries grow like...well, like weeds here in Alola, so feel free to pick up any you find!
