You'd better be ready for the mischief masters of Team Skull to do some Mantine Surfing, too!
Oh. Team Skull. You know you guys can't ride here.
What's up with that?! We look like kids to you or somethin'?!
No. The real reason is...
Yeah, the real reason is?
Every time you try, you keep up those ridiculous dance moves even on Mantine's back. And then you end up in the water.
You want us to stop dancing?! That's our identity, yo! It's all we've got!
Man, forget her, B!
We're Team Skull! No one can stop us from acting hardheaded!
Somebody! Please help keep these numskulls away from Mantine!
What're you looking at, short stuff? Huh? Huh... Wait, huh?! You're that kid!
You wanna scrap, tiny Trainer? A battle, yo? You might've beat us in Hau'oli City, but we'll put our heads together to beat you this time!
Seriously, home slice?! You're too strong for a kid, yo! Argh! I've gotta go make someone else miserable to feel better! Let's go mess with Ilima again, B!
I'm down with that. Verdant Cavern's pretty close by anyway. Hey, you! You better listen to what my homie says and drill it into that thick skull of yours! Seriously! You'd better not forget, numskull!
Nice one, kid! Mantine won't be subjected to their terrible surfing skills thanks to you! You're a decent Trainer. Just like I'd expect from a trial-goer on the island challenge! Why don't you take this from me?
I bet you could take on Captain Ilima's trial with how well you handled that battle. Even Kahuna Hala would probably say you're ready to take on all of Alola! If he says that you're ready, come back here and we'll get you up on Mantine in no time!
Meet lots of different Pok√©mon on your journey! That's how I became friends with Mantine here, back in the days of my own island challenge.
