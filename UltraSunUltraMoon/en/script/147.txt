Ha ha ha! Man, I lost again!
Are you even taking this seriously?
I am! So seriously! I'm seriously enjoying it!
...Enjoying it?
You can enjoy Pokémon battling when you put everything you have into it... which clearly you haven't.
Whoa! Hey, <var>!
This guy is plenny scary!
You're <var>?
Yeah, that's me
Nope, not me
Who?
Hmph. Not very cautious. Even some Pokémon have a better sense of self-preservation than you apparently do.
Hmm. So you have enough sense to be wary. Not bad...
I'm Gladion. Me and my partner, Type: Null, are training to get stronger... We have to get stronger! Though most of our time these days goes to working for Team Skull as their muscle.
Battle me. I won't take no for an answer.
Hmph... It's not like me to slip up like that.
I've got to keep fighting stronger opponents. Looks like I'm still not ready...
What?
Strong opponents?
That kid there. His Pokémon aren't weak.
And sure, it's fine to enjoy battling...
But this brat... he's just using that as an excuse not to try hard because he can't beat the kahuna. Because he can't beat Hala when he's serious!
You know my gramps? Wait. So you think I'm strong?
Awww, look at you, little Gladion! Aren't you just a real cool guy? Heh heh heh...
I guess it's no surprise a homeless kid would turn out spineless, too, huh? No worries! We've got enough backbone to cover for you!
Just give it up already.
Huh?
You know you can't beat me. You'll just get your Pokémon hurt for no reason.
They're good Pokémon.
We came all this way, and for what? For a big fat waste of our time, thanks to you. If you hadn't gotten in our way, we could've stolen the Totem Pokémon from Brooklet Hill!
Let's get out of here. Look, the Murkrow are crying, and it's time we should be flying.
Listen up good, Gladion... The boss does like you. That's true. But you're just some hired help we keep around for when we need you. You aren't part of Team Skull, not really. And you never will be. Got it? You better get it.
Thanks, <var>. And <var>, too. You both gave it your all!
Phew... Looks like I've gotta train up my team if I'm gonna take on the trial at Brooklet Hill next! Here, <var>, take these with you. We're gonna beat this island challenge!
Doing squats really uses all your muscles! My legs are shaking so hard, I can't move!
I'm not doing Alolan sumo! I'm not! I'm definitely not trying to be like Kahuna Hala!
