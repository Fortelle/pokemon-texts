Ah! We built such a wonderful Pokémon League! I'm one of the builders of this Pokémon League. Is it OK to tell you a story rather passionately?
...Sorry, you're about to challenge very crucial battles... You must be very nervous.
When it was decided to build the Pokémon League, we trembled with excitement as we were going to build a big stage for battle in the Alola region for the first time!
And...we also trembled in awe as we were going to develop the sacred Mount Lanakila.
Professor Kukui said that building the league on the sacred ground would show respect to the tapu because we will dedicate our battles to the tapu.
The professor also said that the building shouldn't spoil the scenery of Mount Lanakila and asked us to build a Pokémon League that respects tradition and history but, at the same time, that has the feel of the future—a league that can be built only in Alola. That is how this amazing Pokémon League was built.
I'm very honored that I was able to be involved in the construction of the Pokémon League!
