How are you, <var>?
I heard that you became the Alola Champion. Congratulations!

While you were getting stronger, doing the island challenge...
we were looking into the Z-Power Ring.
It's so mysterious... to be talking about Mega Evolution here, in a region so far away from Kalos...
But we are Trainers. Rather than explaining it all in words, why don't we just show you what Mega Evolution is!
The Trainer holds the Key Stone! The Pokémon holds the Mega Stone! And that's how you can make your Pokémon Mega Evolve during battle!
You can use the Z-Power Ring! So you must be able to use a Key Stone that makes Mega Stones resonate!
If you have a Key Stone, you'll be able to make your Pokémon that hold a Mega Stone Mega Evolve!
This is a Mega Stone that makes Alakazam Mega Evolve. It's called an Alakazite! I'll give the Key Stone and an Alakazite to you!
You know, when you think about it, the Z-Power Ring helps the feelings of a Trainer reach their Pokémon so it can use its Z-Move, right? It only follows that it should be able to achieve Mega Evolution, too!
We'll be taking our leave for research now! Bon voyage!
