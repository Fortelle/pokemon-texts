Poni Island... Almost no one lives on it, but you'll find a whole lot of nature to explore here.
Go. Find the kahuna.
The kahuna of Poni Island also protects the altar where Alola's people worship the Legendary Pokémon. Maybe they will know something that might help you.
Gladion... thank you for this.
I'm glad that I finally know why you left. And that you were trying to help Mother and Father. But if you'd just told me that back then...
I'm sorry... All I could think about in those days was how Null and I had to be stronger... But we'll use the strength that we found to protect the foundation in Mother's place. This will be your battle now. I know you can handle it.
<var>. I'm OK. You don't have to worry. I know what I have to do now.
And... I don't know. Maybe it sounds strange, but... I'm kind of excited.
