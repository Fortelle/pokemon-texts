Do you want to try to take me and my Pok√©mon on at our full strength?
Only if you'll take on mine
I need to prepare first
Heh. I will be awaiting you, then.
Then allow me to show you the power of the kahuna chosen by Tapu Fini itself!
I am Kahuna Hapu! And with the Sparkling Stone entrusted to me by the tapu, I have made this Z-Power Ring!
<var>. Having Z-Power Rings as we do means that we battle with the tapu beside us.
This is the first grand trial of Kahuna Hapu! I will battle you with everything that I have got!
Hyah!
Phew... You are undoubtedly a prodigious Trainer, <var>!
You have succeeded in your final grand trial!
In the past, any Trainer who completed the island challenge would make a pilgrimage to Mount Lanakila to battle the kahunas once more. In these battles alone, the kahunas would no longer hold back in any way.
But this year, you will face a different sort of final trial upon Mount Lanakila. That will be your next destination, but first let us return to Poni Island.
