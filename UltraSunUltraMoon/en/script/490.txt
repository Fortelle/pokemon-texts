Oh!
You've gotta at least learn the moves. Someday you'll be able to use Darkinium Z, too.
Rawr! Like that, right? If I can get stronger, maybe Acerola wouldn't have to worry when she leaves Aether House.
Oh, you boygirl... Finishing up your island challenge, is that it?
Acerola's out at the moment. Think this old man'll do in her place? I'll only hit as hard as she would've done.
You want to take me on, boy?
You want to take me on, girl?
Do I ever!
Not really
You think I'm just made of free time, huh?
Hmm. All right, then. Nice and gentle...
You got me good, kid. Hope I don't get in trouble with the girl for this.
Here. Take it. It's the only reward you'll get from me.
I suppose I ought to take you on in Acerola's place, huh? But that boy Hau got me good when I tried to battle at about Acerola's level, so I don't feel much like bothering again.
So here. Just take it. Acerola left me some of these, so have one.
You should go tell that young filly Mina that you're done with what she asked you to do.
Rawr!
Kwar!
