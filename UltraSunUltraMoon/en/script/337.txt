Did you find out anything useful?

Yes! And Hapu was made the new kahuna!
Little Hapu was? We've been having old man Nanu look after our grand trials up until now.
Heh! Now we've got our own little kahuna! That's great!

Yes. Hapu will do her best for her late grandfather... as I must do my best for my mother's sake. And for Nebby, as well. A-and so! There's a place that we need to go.
Exeggutor Island
To find the flute
Exeggutor Island? Oh, where the flute is... Right!
Where the flute is...? Oh! You mean Exeggutor Island, right?
Well, in that case, we'd better get the chief!
Did you call me?!
Oh my goodness!
Nice to meet you. I'm the chief of the seafolk. I couldn't help overhearing what you said. So why don't I get you to Exeggutor Island?
Oh, thank you!
Hold up there, little lady! It's <var> who will go on this trip. HShe is a Trainer, after all. And Exeggutor Island is a pretty crazy place...
Ha, that's true! There are some crazy critters on that island! It's one thing for a Trainer to go, but if you're not a Trainer, you should just trust your friend to take care of this task for you.
But...
<var>...
I've got this!
You just wait here
You're right. I'm sure you and <var> can handle it better than anyone else could. I'll wait here for you to come back!
And while we're waiting for <var>... I'll make you model for a picture, Lillie!
Exeggutor Island...? Oh, you mean where the flute is!
To find the flute? Oh, you must want Exeggutor Island!
Well, you two did meet the kahuna already... and Poni's captain ain't around anyway, so I guess there's no point waiting on any trials...
All right! The S.S. Magikarp will have you there, and you'll think you're sailing in a dream!
