So you made it...
Ah... I'm sorry. What was your name? ... ... ... Of course! <var>! It is a lovely name. Just lovely.
Now, then. Do you see those two splashes over there?
I am thinking that at least one of them might contain a Wishiwashi. In fact, it's likely both might. Don't you agree? Would you try to drive them downstream with a little help from Lapras?
The Wishiwashi fled downstream, heading deeper into Brooklet Hill...
Well, this is a lovely surprise! You're quite the Trainer, <var>! Please carry on driving the Wishiwashi downstream just like that.
That splash there! Please do check that vigorous splashing and keep driving the Pok√©mon downstream for me.
