Is something being dragged around the stairs?
*shhhfffffff* *shloop shloop*
The sound is getting closer and closer. You should hide somewhere!
The sound is coming from the direction of the stairs...
It's locked!

*shhhfffffff* *shloop shloop*
It's too dark to see anything...
*shhhfffffff* *shloop shloop*
The sound is getting closer, slowly but surely!
*rattle rattle*
Is something trying to open the locker...?
Occupied!
Nobody's here!
*rattle rattle* *bang*

The janitor's grandson left with Grimo...
The door is locked.
