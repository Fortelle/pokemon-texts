What a lovely battle you showed us there, against Team Skull. My thanks to you and your Pokémon. Why don't I heal your team to express my gratitude?
I must admit, I've been wondering about you since I saw you at the Trainers' School... Professor Kukui brought you along, and you and your Pokémon seemed to defeat our teacher so effortlessly! Very well then! Allow me to see if you're ready for my trial!
Behold the magnificent Pokémon of the one and only Captain Ilima!
Well then! I'll wait until you are ready to take me on.
You—or should I say you and your Pokémon— make quite the interesting team!
I do hope you'll come to Verdant Cavern and attempt the trial—the trial of Ilima! You can get there from Route 2... That Rotom Dex of yours will show you the way.
I bid you Alola!
