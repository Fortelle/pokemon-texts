So this...is what they call a festival! It does look like the people are having fun... Not that they should! As though this was any time to celebrate...
You don't have to try so hard to act like you're not interested, you know? Maybe a festival isn't so bad sometimes. The aura measurements are pretty high, too!
Are they? It is only thanks to the Blinding One that Alola is overflowing with such brilliance.
Though the Blinding One is left in such a state now, so dark and enfeebled...
We've just gotta make sure the Blinding One can shine like it used to again, right! So let's get started by having a look around!
You...are likewise new to the shores of Alola. A fellow traveler from a distant land...
Measuring the aura readings here... the numbers appear to be a bit high. What do you think, Captain?
Hm?! What was what? Did you say something? I was...well, I was certainly not distracted by this foolish display of festivity! So there are aura readings in this place... Perhaps it may be the effects of that one they call the island kahuna.
But everything is so bright here in Alola... Far brighter than we had been told it would be. I find it loathsome. This awful brightness.
Even though this is the light we have sought for so long?
Y-yes, I suppose you are right. We must carry out our investigations to return the light to our own world as well. Before the Blinding One can awaken...
Youâ€” You are not native to Alola either, are you? You seem to have come from far away...
