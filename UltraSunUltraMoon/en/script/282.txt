Huh? What's this numskull doing here? What, oh what, should we do?
Forget about it! We've got this Barbaracle... I mean, we've got this barricade! Do you really wanna bother moving it out of the way just to take one kid on?
True, true.
Go home! Go! You're not coming in here, got it? Not unless you find some path through here...
Dude, are you hardheaded? Your skull must be rock! You shouldn't have come in here, yo. Now I'm gonna make you regret it!
That barricade made us soft... There's something to regret all right...
Later days, Team Skull... Farewell, my misspent youth...
Hey, yo, barricade or no, we ain't lettin' you go!
We needed that barricade after all! Come on, hold back a little!
We're gonna get strong enough for anything, even if we don't have that old barricade!
I'm not the bad one here. The real bad ones are whatever fools decided that I'm bad!
I can never make Pokémon give it their all in battles. I guess it's my bad...
I've been thinking of how I can get my Pokémon to really bring out their power... It's not like I wanna work my fingers to the bone trying to get strong, though.
Yo! If you wanna pass through here, then how about you hand over $10,000,000? If I had that much, I wouldn't have to do anything anymore! What's that? You don't have it? Then I'll take whatever you do have!
Ahhhh! I've lost it! Ahhh! The battle and my motivation!
Ever since Team Skull broke up, I've been keeping busy not doing anything. What a charmed life I live!
