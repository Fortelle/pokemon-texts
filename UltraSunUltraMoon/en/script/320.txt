You are all unharmed... Oh, thank goodness...
Yeah, maybe. But there is still a ton we have to do...
There's the president and Guzma, who both disappeared into the Ultra Wormhole...
Not to mention Cosmog and why it stopped moving like that...
Even if she is...like that, Lusamine is still our mother. We can't just leave her in some unknown world on her own, even if it is to defeat Necrozma. And if she doesn't come back...

What is this?
That Lusamine! She is not defeating Necrozma for our sake, but for her own satisfaction?!
Miss President... Why would she do this...?
The machine that the scientist Colress helped develop with our technology... The machine that would restrain Necrozma... We were going to send it back to our world with someone strong enough to safely use it, but... she is going to use it for herself?!
The words we just heard... Is that the truth?
Lusamine... What kind of human is she?! She acted so kind and caring, and yet beneath the surface, she thought of none but herself?!
Was this all for her own selfish satisfaction? Or does she simply feel too much responsibility to take everything upon herself to fix? What is she thinking? What an incomprehensible individual... Though that is much as we had heard.
In truth, we are not strong. We have not needed to be. We use technology to resolve any problem that arises in our lives. That is why we had discussed finding some human we could send through to our world to battle with Pokémon on our behalf.
What was that you just said?! You said you were going to send someone back to your world? Do you know some other way to open an Ultra Wormhole?!
The altar on Poni... The Pokémon that appears there is called the beast that devours the sun.
We rode on the back of a Pokémon like that! That's how we got here to Alola!
Lusamine and Guzma... Do they not understand how strong Necrozma truly is? Or do they go to fight it, even knowing that?
Mister Trainer...and all of you... If Necrozma awakens, it will come to steal the light from Alola. You must protect your world's light! Alola is so brilliant and nice!
Miss Trainer...and all of you... If Necrozma awakens, it will come to steal the light from Alola. You must protect your world's light! Alola is so brilliant and nice!
I have a difficult time with such brilliance, but the light of Alola...is a good thing. The aura of your totems... And, yes, even the light of your Z-Powers. But now, if you'll excuse us...
The altar on Poni... The Pokémon that appears there is known as the beast that calls the moon.
We borrowed such a brute's power ourselves to come here to Alola.
But to think that those two hope to capture Necrozma on their own... Do the people of this world truly have so much confidence in their strength in Pokémon battle?
If Necrozma awakens...it will hunger for light. And it will descend upon Alola to take it.
Our world... Ultra Megalopolis is a world without any light left in it, after all.
We know that the darkness that once fell upon Alola was driven back with light... That is what the old legends and myths tell us. But in all our investigations, we still have not learned what that light was exactly.
Of course it is! After all, the beasts are real. I'm sure we can find it. We'll find the Legendary Pokémon!
Everything'll be fine
You're right
I have to thank you both... Both you, <var>, and you, Hau...
But...now it's my turn to do something.
I took Nebby and ran away with it, but running away didn't actually change anything... This time I have to stand up to my mother and face her head on!
I will give it everything I have! I'll find my own kind of Z-Power!
Lillie, you're amazing...
Miss Lillie... if you and your friends would like to get some rest first, I have prepared a few beds in the staff's residential quarters...
We'll take you up on that.
Yeah, I'm beat!
I think...I'll stay here. I want to spend some time trying to understand what it is my mother might have been thinking...
