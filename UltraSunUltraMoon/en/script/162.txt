The what?
Professor?
The Masked Royal!
I'm here to teach you, oh yeah, about the battle format passed down in Alola for generations... The Pokémon Battle Royal. Woo!
"But, Royal, what's the Battle Royal?" you might ask.
Four Trainers!
Four Trainers, yeah, each pick three Pokémon, yeah, for one big Pokémon battle, oh yeah!
When one Trainer's team can't battle anymore, yeah, the Battle Royal ends! Whichever Trainer has taken out the most Pokémon, yeah, and has the most Pokémon left will emerge the winner. Woo!
First, just give it a shot! Pick your Pokémon, and let's do this!
