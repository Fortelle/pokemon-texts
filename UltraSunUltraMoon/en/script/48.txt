Pew!
Oh... Oh, thank goodness!
You tried using your power again...didn't you? Oh, Nebby... You know what happened last time you used it. You couldn't move for ages after that. I don't want to see you like that again!
No... I shouldn't say that. I'm sorry, Nebby... I know you were trying to save me that time... And I couldn't even help you in return...
Pew!
What... What is that?
Pew pew!
A sparkling...stone? It feels almost warm somehow...
Please, forgive me... I am so grateful to you for helping us out of that dangerous spot.
Who are you?
Are you the kahuna?
I'm...I'm Lillie. And I suppose...this stone must belong to you.
Please... Don't tell anyone about this... About seeing Nebby... It's...it's a secret, OK?
Come on. Into the bag, Nebby.
Pew...
Um...
I'm worried we might get attacked again by some wild Pok√©mon or...or something. I know it's too much for me to ask it, but... Do you think you could see us back to town?
