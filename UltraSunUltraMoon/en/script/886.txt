If you just can't contain your affection for Pokémon, then I recommend the Pokémon Fan Club! It's on Royal Avenue, so you might want to stop in and check it out!
You can try to hammer opponents with strong attacks from a Pokémon with a high Attack stat. But then what about when someone uses a move like Protect to avoid your attacks?
Puh-chaaaah!
No one beats the deals at Thrifty Megamart! But...there's got to be a reason why all the stuff is so cheap, don't you think?
What in the—?! Your Pokémon evolved when you sent it to me in that trade just now!
Take good care of it! Pokémon that are traded grow extra quick!
