Muke...
The Pyukumuku is gazing sadly out over the ocean waves.
Don't you think that Pyukumuku there is feeling a bit down in the dumps?
His name is Mukeo. And he's lost his Mukiet...
His beloved Mukiet was flung out to sea one day by a part-time Pyukumuku chucker.
And ever since that time, he's been just like you see there... Always staring at the sea...
Muuuke...
Maybe it's because he reminds me of myself... I really sympathize with how he must feel.
Maybe Mukiet has been washed ashore again somewhere on the beach...
She's easy to recognize because she always cries "O Mukeo, Mukeo!" If you don't mind...I hope you'll help look for her.
O Mukeo, Mukeo!
That cry... Could it be Mukiet? Should you take this one to Mukeo?
Mukiet!!!
*sniffle* Oh, I'm so glad... I'm so happy for you, Mukeo...
Even if there are people in this world who chuck Pyukumuku away, there are also those who will gently lift them up, as well...
I'm just so moved by this whole experience. You have to let me give you this.
Mukeo... Mukiet... Be happy...for me, too...
Woo-hoo! Pyukumuku!
Hyah! Back to the sea with you!
M-Muuuuuuuukiet!!!
Mukeo!!!
