Hiyah! I challenge you to a battle!
I accept!
I decline!
Master! It is as you said—the true art of battle is to triumph without even fighting!
Master, please lend me your strength!
Master, I am sorry... I have failed you...
Grrourrr!
Trainer!
This is Master Bewear, to whom I have become an apprentice...
And who is a master of a mysterious, wild form of martial art... known only as the Pokémon style!
Grrourrr!
Master was generous enough to act as my Pokémon just now, but be warned! Should Master wish it, he could break even the most brawny of men in twain!
Hm, what's this? Do I see in your possession Fightinium Z?! Proof that you have completed Kahuna Hala's grand trial!
Kahuna Hala and my master are rivals of old! Back in the day, they fought for one week straight without pause, before calling it a draw!
Grrourrr!
As you wish, Master!
My master says that you have proven your strength and are worthy of learning one of his many moves!









This holds the essence of my master's teachings! Use it well.
TM66 is for Payback! If you can attack after an opponent, the move becomes twice as powerful! A good move for Pokémon with low Speed. May you be stronger the next time we meet!
Master!
Grrourrr!
