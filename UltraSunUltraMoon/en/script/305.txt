My, my...what naughty children. You should just lay your heavy heads down.
But I knew that you would struggle onward— I could see through every action you would take. So I knew you would try to reach the president.
And that is why! I knew I would be able to ambush you here, just in front of the mansion where the president remains, and remedy my previous failure. The only reason I let you in the lower floor was to buy time to gather more staff to stop you.
Wow, Mr. Faba! You're so nice!
W-well...of course... I am a wonderful branch chief, after all!
We didn't even have to ask you where the president was, and you just confirmed it for us! So the president is up ahead, huh? Thanks! Now we know where to find Cosmog and Lillie!
What?!
E-enough! You lot! Teach these children a lesson!
We don't have time for this. Help me out here, <var>.
H-h-h-how can this be? To be cornered by mere children?!
Maybe helping one another out isn't so bad...
<var>! Hau! I leave Faba to you!
E-enough! I will show you the true power of Branch Chief Faba! The man who is called Aether Paradise's last line of defense! We will settle this at last with a Multi Battle!

Come on, <var>! I know <var> and the rest of our Pokémon feel the same way we do. We can save Lillie and Cosmog for sure!
I wanna help save Lillie, so I'm going ahead! You don't mind, right?!
Thanks for even giving us the key, Mr. Faba! You've been a big help!
This is why... This is why I can't bring myself to like children.
