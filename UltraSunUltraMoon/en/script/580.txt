Hurry! You've got to find it! Oh my precious little Rocky!!!
I've never even heard of a Rockruff getting lost! Everyone says that they're clever enough to sniff out their Trainers and return to them...
That's why I've been saying that he was kidnapped! Pokénapped! Whatever! I was just a little distracted while shopping... and someone must have taken advantage of that moment to steal my little Rocky! It is simply too adorable! That's why! It must have been stolen from me by someone!
Well, I wouldn't say it MUST be that... There could've been an accident... or it could be lost or could have run away...
Ex-CUSE me?! Run away?! My little Rocky?! Never in a million years!!!
Well, it certainly is missing. We don't refute that. So the question is what to do next...
Pardon the intrusion. Captain Ilima here!
Wuff!
Oh! Captain Ilima! How good of up you stop by. Did you need something from Hau'oli's finest?
It seems this adorable little Pokémon is looking for its Trainer.
Is it indeed! I see! Then this must be...
Wuff!
Oh! Oh-oh-oh! ROCKY!!!
Wuuuffffff!!
Allow Captain Ilima to explain. I found this little bundle of fur waiting for someone outside the apparel shop for ages.
...Y-you did? Well, yes, I suppose I did tell Rocky to wait outside the shop so that I could focus on my shopping and trying on outfits... and then four hours passed before I knew it. I'd completely forgotten about poor Rocky...
... Ma'am...
Sounds like you had a tough day, Rockruff.
Wuff!
I-I'm so sorry, Rocky! I did it again, didn't I! I'm a terrible mother!
Wuff!!
I'm so sorry for troubling you all! I made all this fuss and it's all my fault! Please, I want you to accept this. I hope this whole thing can be our little secret.
W-well, that takes care of that! I think I will absent myself now!
Come, Rocky! I'm going to fix you a veritable feast as my apology for forgetting about you yet again.
Wuuuff!
Looks like that Pokémon's got more sense in its head than its Trainer has in hers.
There are all kinds of Trainers, just as there are all kinds of Pokémon. I'll just see myself out now. Good seeing you, <var>.
Most of my work comes down to finding lost kids or Pokémon, or helping lost tourists. The only thing we never seem to lose in Alola is the peace and quiet! Same goes for today!
