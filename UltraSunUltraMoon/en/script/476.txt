So, do you want to begin my trial, <var>?
I've been waiting for it!
Wait a little longer...
OK, when you're ready, just come talk to me...
Wow, you're really into this... OK, let me explain how my trial works.
First, you need to connect the Charjabug that are on the Roller.
We'll use the electricity from the Charjabug to power up the machine... That should let us call the Totem Pokémon.
Use the four buttons on the edges of the Roller to rotate the panels, and connect the Charjabug in a line.
Just as an example, this is what happens when you rotate the panels.
You don't need to worry about which way the Charjabug are facing, so long as they're connected in a line.
Let me summarize. We connect the Charjabug to summon the Totem Pokémon, which you will hopefully defeat.
Also, as a side note, this is the first time we're using the two machines, the Roller and the Pinger.
So let's get this trial going, OK? My trial is about to begin!
Sophocles's trial will tickle your brain, I promise you that!
Tekyu!
