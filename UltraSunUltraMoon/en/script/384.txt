Desiiiiii!
Rawr!
Mariii!
Hey! I know you're happy that we beat Ilima and all, but you've still gotta wait for me, partner!
Oh! Hey, <var>! I heard the news from Gladion, you know. Savior of Alola, huh? Heh heh! I'm glad I got to set out on my island challenge together with such an awesome Trainer.
But I'm not slacking off, either! It's good to have fun in battle, sure... But losing a battle because all you're really doing is having fun is...well... You can't let down your Pokémon when they're fighting their hardest for you, now can you?
Right, <var>?
Desiiiiii!
Rawr!
Mariii!
I know you want to win... And I'm gonna make sure that happens!
And here, <var>. Have a Max Elixir! You should go ahead and use one when battle is dragging on and on!
When we're both done with our island challenges, we should have a serious battle. You and me. Pokémon and their Trainers have gotta have their hearts in the same place if they're gonna win in battle! That's the way to really have a blast together!
