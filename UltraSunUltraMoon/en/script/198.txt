Nopass!
The Pok√©mon is holding a letter... You take the letter and read it.
Olivia here. This is Probopass. It watches the shop whenever I'm away. I know I asked you to meet me here, but there's been a change of plans. Come meet me at the Ruins of Life past Memorial Hill, when you can.
Pass?
Medicine?
That's for me?
Pass-pass!
Will you read the letter that Probopass holds? 
Pass-pass!
