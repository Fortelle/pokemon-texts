A pipe on the big machine has burst, and clean water is pouring out.
Zzzzzt! Thizzz place is completely wrecked! What in the world happened here?
There's too much rubble in the way. You won't be able to pass through here.
Cards labeled "Relocation Notice" are scattered all over the place.
A poster for an apparel shop is stuck sideways. "Every day is a summer sale! Amazing fashion has never been more affordable!"
A poster for the power plant is stuck sideways. "Safe and secure! Let our power light up your lives!"
...oli... ...ity Ha... "Servi... ... ...ity's... ...need..."
The letters were too faded to read clearly.
Blue sea and blue sky! Ahead is the beachfront area!
The screen is playing static-filled messages over and over.
Guzzzzz!






The mysterious creature disappeared...
Guzzlord disappeared off somewhere...
There's a pile of Guzzlord's leftovers! It's metal scrap, mixed up with dirt and cement.
