Mother!
Well, well...
I had been informed of the intruders, but not that they were kids like you!
I had allowed the other bosses to do as they wished, hoping they would be of use... But it seems you have defeated all of them.
I am impressed you got here.
So you... You're Team Rainbow Rocket's—
Indeed!
Team Rocket's goal was to use all the Pokémon and control the world. But now, I have a bigger, better organization. Team Rainbow Rocket!
And I, Giovanni, am its leader!
Mother! Are you OK?! Mother, please answer!
The president will not awaken for some time.
I have used the power of that Ultra Beast to make her sleep...
And when she awakens next, she will be a loyal servant to my will!
What?! How...how could you?
Team Rainbow Rocket will conquer all worlds! We will build an army of UBs!
But in order for this precious dream to be realized, we need the technology of the Aether Foundation—the technology of other worlds!
...But I also appreciate the skill it took you to get this far.
I like those who show strength! Why not put that strength to good use, in my Team Rainbow Rocket?
Hah! You are calm enough to joke, I see.
Ha! Of course that would be your answer.
Having a kid stand in front of me like this... Such a thing should never happen. But for some reason, it also makes me feel nostalgic.
If you insist on disrupting my plans, I will make you feel a world of pain!
...I see you have raised your Pokémon with utmost care.
It would be foolish to fight such a kid with all my might.
Ha, very well. I will leave Aether Paradise in your hands.
But remember, my Team Rainbow Rocket will never fail!
Never forget that!
I shall step aside this time! I hope we meet again...
