You there, boy.
You there, girl.
Seems to me you're trying to get into Po Town. You sure you've thought this through? You'd better be ready if you're thinking of coming in here. Ready to live as Team Skull. Or ready to take on Team Skull.
You really think you're ready for that?
I am!
Maybe?
Run back home, kid.
I guess everyone has their own reasons. I've got my reasons, too, for doing what I do. I'll have them let you in.
If you don't make it, I'll be sure your remains at least get back home.
