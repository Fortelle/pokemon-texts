My sweet Pokémon... I promise I'll keep you safe... I'll protect you with my love...
Ah...
You must be <var> and Hau. Welcome to Aether Paradise. The Aether Foundation's own private island.
You must be <var> and Hau. Welcome to Aether Paradise. The Aether Foundation's own private island.
I am the president of the foundation. But please, just call me Lusamine. I'm so glad that we got to meet.
I'm glad there are people like you, who travel the islands to learn more about Pokémon...
But there are also those unfortunate people who harm Pokémon for their own selfish reasons or even for profit.
And that is why I am here. I will be like a mother to all of those poor Pokémon and shower them with love.
Even Pokémon from distant worlds, far from the Alola region, are worthy of my love.
Wow, Miss Lusamine! I don't know how you do all this! You're, like, not even that much older than us!
Oh, you sweet boy!
I'm already over 40!
You are?
Wait, WHAT?!
Oh, you! The right style does wonders, you know. And, Hau, your style is a bit wanting, hm? I'll have to take you out sometime and help you pick a smashing outfit.
L-like what you wear? I don't think anyone else could pull off that kind of look! Except maybe Lillie...
Oh, don't you worry. You just leave everything up to me. Trust me—children would all be much happier if they'd only listen to the adults around them.
