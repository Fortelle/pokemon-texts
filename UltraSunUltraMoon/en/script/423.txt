<var>! Over here!
If you head into Poni Grove here, there're Ultra Beasts right here in Alola!
My young friend <var>. Congratulations on becoming Champion.
I have heard that your final battle against Master Hau was quite fiery.
And now the two of you will look into the mysteries of the Ultra Beasts, is that right? I will support you however I can. I've brought you both a little something.
My <var> loves malasadas, too! Thanks, Ms. Wicke!
Young Master Gladion also left something with me for you. It is Type: Null.
I'll also entrust you with all of the memory drives needed to change the type of Type: Null's Evolution—the Pokémon Silvally.
You received a whole stack of memory drives!
Type: Null... It was being researched as a possible weapon to be used to fight the Ultra Beasts, but I think a Trainer like you, <var>... Master Gladion thinks you will be able to show Type: Null that there is much more to this wide world than that.
Man, that Gladion... He just doesn't want to let me win, does he? When he gets back from that training of his, I'm definitely asking him for a battle!
But now I'm off to Poni Grove!
The members of the Ultra Recon Squad were also making for Poni Grove, I believe.
But you have so many Pokémon already that you cannot accept Type: Null now. Please come collect it when you're able. I will be at Aether Paradise.
