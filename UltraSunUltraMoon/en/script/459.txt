Thanks for stopping by!
Welcome to Lush Jungle, the trial grounds for me, Mallow!
You ready to get in some hot water? My trial is ready for you, if you're ready for it!
I'm ready!
I'm not ready
Then come back when you think you're ready!
I knew it the first time I saw you and your team... You've chosen only the finest ingredients!
You are the one who got a Sparkling Stone straight from Tapu Koko, aren't you? I totally get it now.
Ah, the breath of the jungle... I can tell just what today's special should be...
Yup! It's gotta be! My secret specialty: the Super Mallow Special!
I'm gonna need you to find three ingredients for me! I'll need a Mago Berry, some Honey, and a Big Root!
Here you go! I brought you a Forage Bag to hold all the ingredients you'll gather for your trial.
If you just tossed all the trial ingredients in your own Bag, it would make something all right... Something like a Mallow Mess, I guess!
Let's go and find the first ingredient right away!
Geez, those Fomantis... I wonder if they could tell how strong you are?
You can find Mago Berries around here. But you'll also find Fomantis living here, 'cause they love Mago Berries, too. If you take a Mago Berry that the Fomantis had their eyes on, they might not take it too kindly!
When you're done gathering ingredients here, just let me know!


OK, then, here in Lush Jungle...
It's time for Mallow's trial to begin!
