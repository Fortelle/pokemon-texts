Slowpoke really has its own tempo, huh? It's never confused by other Pokémon's moves. It's too slow to get confused...or to take a hint. Leave me alone already, would you, Slowpoke?

If you want to study Pokémon moves... I'd have a look at those unbelievable moves that the island kahuna's Pokémon can use! There's gotta be some kinda secret to why they are so amazingly strong.
Look! Catch!
Would you stop?! I know they're squishy, but that's no reason to throw Pyukumuku at me! Throw a Poké Ball if you must throw something!
Enjoy Hau'oli! Enjoy Alola! And most of all, enjoy Pokémon!

Alola! Even if you're a Champion— No, maybe especially if you're a Champion, it's always important to be polite and greet others!
The Wingull fly... And their droppings fall... Ah, the beauty of nature!
Pyu!

I just told my mom that I'm going to Akala Island next! Then she slapped me on the back so hard I'm still feelin' it and sent me on my way!
