B-boyG-girl! Do you have <var> handy? I'll pay you $5,000 for it if you have one!
Will you sell the man your <var>?
Oof, but you don't seem to have one to sell! I guess I shouldn't have sprung that on you so suddenly, huh...
Oh, that's all right. I shouldn't have sprung that on you so suddenly.
Thank you for sharing your time with me! Maybe I'll see you around again!
You sold the man <var>!
Wonderful! This will help round out my Potion collection!
Oh, thank goodness... Now I can save my old man, who accidentally ate a poisonous mushroom!
What a relief! Now I can help my poor old wife keep awake. She always seems to nod off while I'm talking!
Thank you for this! A Lemonade is just what my daughter was needing after scorching her tongue on that spicy five-star curry!
All right! My younger brother was being kept up at nights thinking about the color of an Ultra Ball. Now he'll finally be able to get some sleep!
What a helper! With a Heart Scale like this one, maybe I'll be able to get my little sister to remember Bide. She's so impatient when it comes to getting what she wants!
Ahh, thank you! Now I can finally finish my experiment to test which is bigger, a Big Malasada or a Big Nugget!
This is a huge help! Now my old mum can go safely into the tall grass to look for the glasses she dropped.
Wonderful! My down comforter will feel a bit warmer again with the addition of some Pretty Wings like this one!
I thank you! Now I can finally complete that taste test to see which is the most bitterâ€”Energy Powder, Bitter Malasadas, or Petaya Berries!
