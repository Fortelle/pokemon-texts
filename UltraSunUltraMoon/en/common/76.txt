Nice line of sight!
That's a good angle!
Think you could get a bit closer?
You're just slamming that shutter, huh?
It's super simple, and that's great!
Just going head-on, huh? ¯\_(´ー｀)_/¯
Where'd you take this?
Nice background, though!
Hey... This is actually cute!
Nice! Real nice!
Let me see its eyes, please!
Is that really what this Pokémon looks like?
Maybe try getting it head-on?
I think it's pretty good!
A nice profile shot feels fresh!
Looking at it from this angle isn't bad either.
I guess it's novel, anyway.
Is that how you take photos?
Side profile, huh? Well, aren't you cool.
Really? Sideways? ¯\_(´ー｀)_/¯
I can't see its face...and I'd like to.
Here, lovely! Look over here!
I've never seen this one from the back before.
Nice backside.
I don't know... Do you think this works?
One of my favorite angles.
Are you trying to set me up?
Oooh! Did you stage this?
I'd like to see its face, but this is good, too.
No face?! ¯\_(´ー｀)_/¯
I think it might be too small.
I can't see much of anything. ¯\_(´ー｀)_/¯
I think I need my bifocals...
Where's the Pokémon?
I can't see anything, but I can tell you're trying!
I dunno what you're going for, but nice try.
It'd be better if I could see more! ♪
Don't worry! You're just getting started!
Try to actually take a good shot next time.
I actually kind of like photos like this.
I'd like to see it better. If only. ¯\_(´ー｀)_/¯
If you try a bit harder, you should make it.
That's...a Pokémon, right?
Keep trying! You'll make it!
So you went this direction, huh?
I can't really see it, but it might be good!
I don't really get your aim, but it's interesting.
You're no pro, but it's not THAT bad...
I don't really get it, but I think it's fine! ♪
Well, you're not a pro, right? It's fine!
Not too shabby!
Maybe if I could see more of it... ¯\_(´ー｀)_/¯
Just a bit bigger next time!
It's about average, I guess.
I look forward to your next try! ♪
Oooh, so close! A swing and miss!
Looking good!
Good! Needs more Pokémon!
I'd say it has real flavor.
It's good, but I want to see more Pokémon!
I love the composition!
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. Looking good.
Brilliant! You're really good!
Well, I can see the Pokémon. ¯\_(´ー｀)_/¯
I think it's really nice! ♪
This one is getting pretty good, huh?
I like it—this kind of angle.
Are you a pro?
It's a good shot. Like anyone can take.
I like the overall feel of this one.
Try to focus better.
How about focusing next time? ¯\_(´ー｀)_/¯
Isn't it pretty blurry?
It looks kind of fuzzy to me.
It's got style, but a bit too blurry.
Are you messing with me?
Out of focus! Try harder!
Try to keep it in focus next time! ♪
I know you can do it! Don't give up!
If it were in focus, it would've been perfect!
That is so COOL!
Awesome! I love it!
That is one cool shot.
That's a smashing photo!
I wish you'd photo me like that...
You must be a famous photographer!
I knew it! You really are a pro!
Maybe I should catch one of those...
You're cool. I'll give you that! ¯\_(´ー｀)_/¯
Where'd you take this one, huh?
Super cute! (#^-^#)
That's a cute shot! :)
Very cute! Thumbs-up! ♪
I can't get enough of this form!
My grandkids are cuter than that!
Kawaii! ^^
Whoa! Cuteness overload!
I gotta give it up to you this time. ¯\_(^-^)_/¯
My eyes! They can't take the cuteness!
Awww, it's so cuuuuuute! ♪
It probably has a high IQ, huh?
Very distinguished looking...
Nice! I want one!
I already have one. ¯\_(´ー｀)_/¯
Is it Psychic type?
I bet it's good at calculating things! ♪
I'd never seen this one before! ＼(・ｏ・)／
Doesn't it have good Sp. Atk? IIRC.
I'm trying to catch one of these myself!
I like this kind of Pokémon.
Look at those muscles!
I'd take one. ¯\_(´ー｀)_/¯
What a body...
I'm raising one of these on my team!
I don't know. Not my type.
That body is no joke!
That's a sturdy-looking Pokémon all right...
My boyfriend has one of those!
My Machoke's tougher than that.
Nice muscles! ♪
So beautiful! ♪
Beautiful, eh? ¯\_(´ー｀)_/¯
I want one...
I haven't ever found one of these beauts!
Sometimes you get lucky with a good subject.
I like this photo!
That Pokémon is positively glowing!
Ugh. What are you trying to do to my eyes?
Don't mind me as I wipe away the drool...
Beauty is justice! ♪
So close! Isn't it missing a little something?
I'd love to see more of it.
I think you missed a bit there. Keep trying!
Think about your framing, pal.
Let me guess: You're good at selfies?
Looks pretty steady!
Maybe try not cutting it off? ¯\_(´ー｀)_/¯
Didn't cut off too much this time!
Ooooh, so close! （＞_＜）
The composition isn't too bad.
You cut it off! Try harder!
Close, but you've cut a bit off there.
You missed quite a lot there. So close!
You cut it off so bad that maybe it's good...
You cut off a lot, but I like it.
That's really a lot cut off. Try again!
You cut it off, but it was a good try!
Too cut off. Keep trying! ¯\_(´ー｀)_/¯
Try to actually aim at the Pokémon. ♪
Shoot the whole Pokémon next time.
What were you even aiming at? ¯\_(´ー｀)_/¯
I do the same thing all the time!
I'm sorry, but I don't get it.
Try to follow it as it moves!
Hold your camera carefully!
Well, that's gutsy! It's all cut off!
I think you may have cut off too much.
Keep trying, aspiring photographer!
You missed the mark. Try again!
Too cut off! （＞ｏ＜） Keep trying!
Good on you! Getting such an early start.
Good morning! ♪
Too sleepy... (´ー｀) 
You're up and trying early, huh?
I'm still sleepy... *yawn*
Morning! Good shot!
Is it already morning?
What a nice morning! ＾＾
Bonjour !

Afternoon!
Hungry... When's lunch? (´ー｀)
It's raining over here...
Thanks for sharing a great photo!
I've been asleep till now...
Alola looks magical!
You're full of pep this afternoon!
It's already night over here.
Guten Morgen!
¡Hola! ¿Cómo estás?
There's a lovely sunset.
I must confess that I am weary at this hour.
It's the magic hour!
Is this what they called the golden hour?
Hmm, I'd like to linger here a little longer... ♪
Is it that time already?! I'd better make dinner!
This is the best time of day.
Now! Take as many shots as you can now!
I want to sleep... (´ー｀)
Wow... It's already evening?
Now that's a nice mood...
Good evening! ♪

Good night!
Estou com sono...
It's night! Nighty-night!
Pretty romantic. Mm-hmm.
I'm getting sleepy...
Aren't you sleepy? ¯\_(´ー｀)_/¯
I get sleepy when it's dark out.
Good night! ♪
Buonanotte!
Zzz...
It's not totally black, I guess.
You're up late working hard!
Maybe you'll catch something rare at night?
Oh! Nighttime photography, huh?
Nice shot! d(>_< )
I'd sure like to go to Alola...
Nice. I just want to pet it!
It's a decent photo.
Try harder. ¯\_(´ー｀)_/¯
Even I could take a shot like that.
I guess it's good enough for an amateur.
I'd give it a B-.
I like it.
I hope you can become a real photographer!
Thanks for sharing your photo with us!
I like the atmosphere.
Not bad. ¯\_(´ー｀)_/¯
I think it's lovely!
Grazie!

Looks a bit smug, doesn't it?
I don't know. Looks a bit too calculated.
SO. COOL. ＞＜
You're really trying hard to be cool, huh?
Hmm. Not bad. (´ー｀)
Reminds me of myself when I was young.
Must be a strong one.
I'd like to put that one on a poster!
I didn't know this one was so cool...
Is it trying to act like a hero or something?
No fair. That is just too darn cute!
So cunning! But so cute!
My partner is cuter!
