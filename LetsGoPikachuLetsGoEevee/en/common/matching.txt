You can't have a Link Trade because your previous Link Trade was interrupted due to a communication error or power interruption. Please wait a while and then try again to trade.
You can't trade because you don't have two or more Pokémon. You can't trade your partner Pokémon or the Pokémon you've taken out of a Poké Ball. Please get your Pokémon ready, and then try again.
A Double Battle is not currently possible because neither your party nor your Box has two or more Pokémon. Please get your Pokémon ready and then try again.
