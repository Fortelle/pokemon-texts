Hey! You have Pokémon, right? Come on! Let's battle 'em!
No! Caterpie can't hack it!
Shh! You'll scare the bugs away. Another time, OK?
Yo! You can't punk out on battle if you're a real Pokémon Trainer!
Huh? I've got no other Pokémon to battle with!
This totally stinks! I'm gonna catch some stronger Pokémon!
Hey, wait up! What's the hurry? Why the rush?
I give! You're good at this!
Sometimes, there's something on the ground even if you can't see it. If you've got a Pokémon with you, it may help you find things like that!
Do you want to know the trick for throwing a Poké Ball well?
Your battle was right on target!
Throw a Poké Ball to hit the center! You know! The center of those two rings, right?
Hey, do you have a big Pikachu?
Oh no. Really?
I came here to catch a big Pikachu! You heard me right. Look closely at the Pokémon you encounter, and you'll see what I mean!






Whoa! You surprised me! ...Oh, you're just a kid?
Wow! Surprised again!
Kids like you shouldn't be wandering around here in the dark.
Did you come to explore the cave, too?
Losing stinks! It's so uncool.
I came all the way down here to show the girls how tough I am!
Wow! It's way bigger in here than I thought!
Oh! I lost!
How do you get out of here? It's so big, I may get lost.
What! Don't sneak up on me!
My Pokémon won't do!
I have to find stronger Pokémon. Where might they be?
What? I'm waiting for my friends to find me here.
I lost?
I came because I heard there are some very rare Fossils here.
There are suspicious characters lurking around in the caves. And you are...?
You got me!
But I really saw suspicious characters! I'm sure they're from Team Rocket!
You need to go through this cave to get to Cerulean City.
I lost...
Zubat are pretty tough! But if you can catch one, you'll be able to count on it.

OK! I'll share!






We, Team Rocket, are the Pokémon bandits! We strike fear into others with our strength!
I blew it!
Oh man! My associates won't stand for this!
We're pulling a big job here! Get lost, kid!
So you are good...
If you find a Fossil, give it to me and scram!
Little kids shouldn't be messing around with grown-ups!
Boy, that really makes me steam!
Seems that Pokémon lived here long before people ever came.
Hey, matey! Let's do a little jig!
Impressive! You took the wind right out of my sails!
How many kinds of Pokémon do you think there are in this big world?
Ahoy there! Do you not get seasick on ships?
I was just careless!
My pa told me there're 100 kinds of Pokémon. But I think there are more.
I love Pokémon! Do you?
Wow! You're great!
Listen, listen! Let me be your friend, OK? Then we can trade Pokémon and do stuff.
I collected these Pokémon from all around the world!
Oh no! I went around the world for these!
You hurt my poor Pokémon! I demand you heal them at a Pokémon Center!
You insolent pup! How dare you barge in!
Humph! You rude child! You have no sense of courtesy!
I wish to be left alone! Get out!



Competing against the young keeps me youthful.
Good match! Ah, I feel young again!
Fifteen years ago, I would have won!
Check out what I fished up!
I'm all out!
Party? The cruise ship's party should be over by now.
Which do you find to be more worthy: a strong Pokémon or a rare one?
I must salute you!
Personally, I prefer Pokémon that are both strong and rare!






Hello, stranger! I can't tell if you're from the seas or mountains, but stop and chat. All my Pokémon are from the sea.
Awww! I let that one get away!
I was thinking I might be able to hook you as a fishing buddy, too!
Even sailors have Pokémon!
OK, you're not bad.
We caught all our Pokémon while we were out at sea.
I like feisty kids like you!
Argh! Lost it!
You're all right, kid! You're gonna grow up into an amazing adult!
You know what they say about sailors. We're all itching for a fight after ages at sea!
Right! Good battle, mate!
Hahaha! Want to be a sailor, mate?



I wonder if you are good enough for me...
Apparently you are good enough for me...
I never wanted to lose to anybody, especially to a younger kid...
I can see you're good. Let me see exactly how good!
I was confident I'd win that one, too...
Tsk. I concede—you're better than me!
If you can get through here, you can go meet the Elite Four.
No! Unbelievable!
I'm pretty sure I can still beat you when it comes to knowledge about Pokémon!
This here is Victory Road. It's the final test for Trainers!
Achoo!
This place is full of tricky spots. If you get stuck, try moving some stone blocks around.
Ah, so you wish to challenge the Elite Four?
You got me!
A boy named <var> passed by this way, too, a little while ago.
Come on! I'll whip you!
I got whipped!
You earned the right to be on Victory Road...
Is Victory Road too tough?
Well done!
Many Trainers give up their challenge here and go home.
I heard rumors of a child prodigy.
The rumors were true!
So, it was you who beat Giovanni of Team Rocket?
Trainers live to seek stronger opponents.
Oh! So strong!
True strength comes from taking on tough battles, you know.
I'll show you just how good you are... Just kidding! Time you learned there's always someone better!
Arghhh! This is the worst!
I guess it really is true... There's always someone better...
Only the chosen can pass here!
I don't believe it!
All the Trainers here have their sights set on the Pokémon League. Don't let your guard down.








Who are you? How did you get here?
Oww! We got beat bad!
Blast it... You're dissing Team Rocket, aren't you.
You snuck into Team Rocket's operation? What nerve!
Boom!
You're not going to get away with this, brat!
Intruder alert!
I can't do it!
You're looking for a Cubone? Hmph! I don't know what you're talking about.
What'd you hope to achieve by coming here?
This won't do!
OK, I'll talk... If you wanna find the boss, take the elevator.

Why...?

I heard that you can see ghosts with the Silph Scope.
I surrender!
The Team Rocket Hideout has four underground floors. Think you can reach the boss?
Stop meddling in Team Rocket's affairs, or else!
Oof! Taken down!
Looking for a Cubone, eh? I just saw one of our Grunts come by with one! Um... It's gotta be around here somewhere.
Look who finally showed up, huh? We got word from upstairs that you were coming!
What? I lost? No!
Go wherever you want, then! But the elevator won't budge without a Lift Key!







No!

H-help me! I'm a Silph employee!
How'd you know I was really from Team Rocket?!
To be totally accurate, I work for both Silph and Team Rocket. It's hard to make ends meet!
It's off-limits here! Go home!
You're good.
Can you find your way through the maze here? It's not easy, I tell you!
No kids are allowed in here!
You're tough for a kid!
Those bright blue tiles are teleport panels. That's how you get around in high-tech buildings like this one.
Hey, kid! What are you wandering here for?
I goofed!
Silph Co. is gonna work with Team Rocket, whether they like it or not!
If you get in our way, then you'll...really be in our way!
I give up!
Fine, I guess you earned a hint! You can open locked doors with a Card Key!
I support Team Rocket more than I support Silph Co.!
You really got me!
Hmph... Team Rocket said that if I helped them, they'd let me study Pokémon to my heart's content.
Team Rocket has taken control of Silph Co.!
Arrrgh!
Fwahahaha! Our boss has been after this place for ages!
My Pokémon are my loyal servants!
Oh man! What useless servants!
The doors in this building are all electronically locked. Without a Card Key, they won't open!
Intruder spotted!
Who are you?!
This is not good... I better tell the boss!
I heard a kid was wandering around!
Shucks...
It's not smart to pick a fight with Team Rocket!
We study Poké Ball technology on this floor!
Oh man! Blast it!
We worked on the ultimate Poké Ball—one to catch even Legendary Pokémon without fail.
Whaaat? There shouldn't be any children here!
Oh goodness!
You're only on 5F. This building goes all the way up to 11F. You've got a long way to go still, kid.
Show Team Rocket a little respect!
*cough cough* It's only 'cause I'm coming down with a cold!
*cough* Which reminds me. Koffing evolves into Weezing!
I am one of the four Rocket Sisters!
What?!
No matter! My sisters will avenge me!
That rotten president! Serves him right for transferring a star employee like me off to the boondocks! That's why Team Rocket came after us—I'm sure of it!
Shoot!
Argh! I'll be sent back to the middle of nowhere if I keep battling like this...
You dare betray Team Rocket?
You traitor!
You'll never be on our side! If you stand for justice, you betray us bad guys!
Uh-oh! I found a little troublemaker!
Lights out!
You won't find anything by just scurrying around!
Heheh! You mistook me for a Silph worker?
I'm done for!
You may just be a kid, but...you're pretty good!
I am one of the four Rocket Sisters!
Sorry, Sis! I lost!
Doesn't matter. My sisters will repay the favor! And if that thought scares you, go home already.



This is as far as you'll go!
Not enough grit!
If you don't turn back... I'll call for backup!
You're causing us problems!
Huh? I lost?
So what do you think of the maze that is the Silph building, huh?
I am one of the four Rocket Sisters!
Sis! No! Don't give me a time-out!
My sisters will take care of you! You don't stand a chance.
Your Pokémon seem to adore you, kid!
Gaaah!
If only I had started as a Trainer at your age...
Your Pokémon have weak points! I can nail them!
You hammered me!
Exploiting weak spots does work. Think about type matchups.
I am one of the four Rocket Sisters! And I'm the oldest.
I'm the oldest, yet you beat me!
Argh... You embarrassed me... My sisters will avenge me!
Welcome to 10F! So good of you to join me!
I'm stunned!
Nice try, but the boardroom is up one more floor.
Enough of your silly games!
No continues left!
Are you satisfied with beating me? Then go on home!



Halt! State your purpose for being here!
Gaah! Demolished!
How exactly do you plan on beating us?
Who are you? There shouldn't be anyone here.
Ouch!
A key? I don't know what you're talking about.



I can't get out! This old place is one big puzzle.
Oh no! My bag of loot!
Pressing a secret switch should open and close a door on the same floor.
This place is, like, huge!
Ayah!
I wonder where my partner went.
My mentor once lived here.
Whew! Strong!
It's troubling when you can't get where you want to go... Try climbing down that long ladder.
Uh-oh... Where am I now?
Awoo!
You can find stuff lying around. The residents must've left it.
This place is ideal for a lab. Look at all this space.
What was that for?
I like it here. I can get more research done if I live here...
This tunnel goes a long way, kid!
Doh! You win!
In long tunnels like these, you won't lose your way as long as you follow the darker patches on the ground. They're darker because other people have walked that way, creating a path.
Hmm... Maybe I'm lost in here.
Ease up! What am I doing? Which way is out?
That sleeping Pokémon on Route 12 forced me to take this detour.
Outsiders like you need to show me some respect!
I give!
You have potential! Are you interested in becoming a Hiker?
Pokémon fight! Ready, go!
Game over!
Oh well, I'll get a Zubat as I go!
Eek! Don't get so close just because it's dark!
It was too dark to see...
There are some Pokémon in tunnels, too. I saw a Machop earlier.
I came this far looking for wild Pokémon.
I'm out of Pokémon!
You looked cute and harmless. Was I ever wrong!
You have a Pokémon! Let's start!
You play hard!
Whew! I'm all sweaty now.
Do you know how you can avoid getting lost in the mountains? You can bend twigs as trail markers.
You're stronger than I thought!
You won't get lost in battle.
Hahaha! Can you beat my power?
Oops! Outmuscled!
I go for power because I hate thinking.
You have a Pokédex? I want one, too.
Shoot! I am so jealous!
When you finish your Pokédex, can I have it?
Um... Do you know about Pokémon cosplay?
Well, that's that.
Cosplay is creating a costume, like a Clefairy costume, and dressing up for fun. FYI, I am cosplaying as a Black Belt.
My Pokémon techniques will leave you crying!
I give! You've got more technique than me.
In the mountains, you'll often find Rock-type Pokémon.
Even on a mountain like this, an Ace Trainer like me exists!
Ugh. My pride as an Ace Trainer...
Wherever we battle, Ace Trainers are strong.



Hit me with your best shot!
Fired away!
I'll raise my Pokémon to beat yours, kid.
I draw pictures of Pokémon when I'm at home.
Whew... I'm tired...
I'm an artist, not a fighter. I'll go home to draw.
Urrg... Awaa... Huhu... Graa...
Hwa! I'm saved!
I heard that ghosts can be identified with the Silph Scope.
Kekeke... Kwaaah!
Hmm? What am I doing?
Sorry! I was possessed!
Be gone, malevolent spirit! Agh! Kwaaah!
Whew! The spirit left!
The others above... They must be possessed, too.
Ghost! No! Kwaaah!
Where is the ghost?
I must have been dreaming...
I see...a bone and...crying! Kwaaah!
What!
We can't determine the identity of the ghost...
Huhuhu... Beat me not!
Huh? Who? What?
May the departed Pokémon rest in peace...
Give...me...your...all...
*gasp*
I was under possession.
Join...us...
What a nightmare!
I was possessed. My skills still have a long way to go...
Zombies!
Huh?
I regained my senses.
Urgah... Urff...
Whoo!
I fell to evil spirits, despite my training in the mountains... Frustrating...
Destruction! Despair!
Uuung...
I feel anemic and weak...
Urff... Kwaah!
Something fell out!
My hair didn't fall out! It was a malevolent spirit!
Ke...ke...ke... ke...ke...ke!
Keee!
What's going on here?


























































































































































































































































































































Hey! I saw you in Viridian Forest!
You beat me! Argh!
There are other kinds of Pokémon than the ones you find in forests.
Hi! I like shorts! They're comfy and easy to wear! Wow! You're wearing shorts, too!
I don't believe it!
Shorts are the cutting edge of current fashion!
Excuse me! You looked at me, didn't you?
You're mean!
You shouldn't be staring if you don't want to battle!
Are you a Trainer? Let's get to it right away!
If I'd had new Pokémon, I would've won!
You're using your Pokémon Box, right? When you aren't battling, you can switch the Pokémon in your party with those in your Box most any time!



Hey! My shorts are cool, right? You can stare at them!
Lost! Lost! Lost!
I always wear shorts, even in winter. That's my policy.
I'll battle you with the Pokémon I just caught.
Done like dinner!
Trained Pokémon are stronger than the wild ones.
Eek! Did you push me?
That's it?
Mt. Moon is just ahead. Lots of Pokémon appear there, so be sure to stock up on Poké Balls back at the Pewter City Poké Mart!



Who's there? Quit listening in on us!
I just can't win!
*whisper whisper*
Excuse me! This is a private conversation!
Ugh! I hate losing.
*whisper whisper*



Hahaha. I'll battle you like a gentleman.
Argh! Super annoying and frustrating!
Sorry, I lost my composure. You're strong...
Huh? You want to talk to me?
This stinks... I couldn't beat your challenge...
I should bring more Pokémon with me. I'd feel safer that way.
Me? Well, OK. I'll play!
Things just didn't work out.
I want to get stronger. What's your secret?
I've never seen you around. Are you good?
You're too good!
Is my Pokémon weak? Or am I just bad? Which do you think?
You look good at Pokémon, but how is your chemistry grade?
Ow! Meltdown!
I am better at school than this!
All right! Let's play a game!
Drat! Came up short!
Things didn't work today.
You should be informed. You need strategy to win at this!
It's not logical!
Did I miscalculate...? Did I use a wrong move? Hmmm...



School is fun, but so are Pokémon.
You made it clear to me that I should stick with school.
I was planning on getting some fresh air for a change, but we're stuck here because of the gates at Saffron City.
Meowth is so cute! Meow, meow, meow!
Meeeeyow!
I think Pidgey and Rattata are cute, too! I can't make up my mind!
We're showing off our Pokémon! Do you want to try?
Look what you did to my poor, cute Pokémon!
Saffron City's gatekeeper won't let us through. I know he's doing his job, but I think he's mean.
I'm a rambling, gaming dude!
Missed the big chance!
Whether it's a game or a Pokémon battle— once you start, you just can't stop!
What's a cute, round, and fluffy Pokémon?
Stop! Don't be so mean to my Clefairy!
I read that Clefairy evolves when it's exposed to a Moon Stone. I read that in a Pokémon Journal. I wonder if it's true...














You have a Pokémon with you! You're my easy target!
You're strong.
The tunnel coming up is pitch black inside. You'll need Light Up to get through there.
Who are you? That's a nice Pokémon you're walking with.
Out like a light!
I'm so frustrated, I can't even cry.
I'm taking the Rock Tunnel to go to Lavender Town...
Can't measure up...
Are you off to the Rock Tunnel, too?
Don't you dare patronize me!
No! You're too much.
You're obviously talented. Good luck to you!
Bwahaha! Great! I was bored, eh!
Keep it coming, eh! Oh wait. I'm out of Pokémon!
You sure had guts, standing up to a Hiker like me there, eh?
Hahaha! Aren't you a little toughie!
What's that?
Hahaha! Kids should be tough!



Hahahaha! Bring it on!
Hahahaha! You beat me fair!
Hahahaha! Us hearty Hikers always laugh even when we lose!
Go, my super bug Pokémon!
My bug Pokémon...
If you don't like bug Pokémon, you bug me!
Wow, you came all the way here? Maybe you're a Poké Maniac, too? Want to see my collection?
Humph. I'm not angry!
I have more rare Pokémon at home!
I've been out at a Pokémon Gym a few times... but I always lose.
Ohh! After all my training!
I noticed some Poké Maniacs prowling around. Can you imagine? Them? Up here in the mountains?
We Hikers are naturals at climbing mountains!
Phew... I'm worn out from walking through that tunnel.
*huff huff* We Hikers aren't prepared for cross-country!
Hi, kid! Want to see my Pokémon?
Oh no! My precious Pokémon!
I don't like you. I don't like anyone better than me!
Aaaaaahhh... This mountain air is delicious!
Aaaawww... I lost!
I feel bloated on mountain air!
I'm feeling a bit faint. I haven't hiked in some time.
I'm too tired. I wasn't up for it.
The Pokémon here in the mountains are so chunky... I wish there were pink Pokémon with a floral pattern!
Win, lose, or draw!
Tsk! Didn't go my way!
Pokémon is life! And to live is to play games!



Let's go, but don't cheat!
Huh? That's not right!
I did my best. I have no regrets.
Hello! Do you use electricity safely at home?
You're great. You beat me!
Spread the word to save energy!



Fwahaha! I have never lost!
My first loss!
I try to think victory depends on the luck of the day! Otherwise, I get depressed.
I have never won before...
I saw this coming...
I try to think victory depends on the luck of the day... Otherwise, I get depressed.
I'm the strongest among my friends!
Arghhh! My Pokémon need to be stronger!
There's a fat Pokémon that comes down from the mountains. I bet it'd be strong if you can catch it.
Hey! Do you always turn off lights?
Whoa! Kids nowadays are so strong!
Well, better get back to work.
I raised my Pokémon carefully. They should be ready by now!
Bye-bye! Thank you, and good-bye!
Tch... I better go find stronger ones!
Yeah! I got a bite here!
Tch! Just a small fry...
Hang on! My line's snagged!
Be patient. Fishing is a waiting game.
That one got away!
Even without a fishing rod, there's still a way to catch Pokémon in the water.
I'm searching for a Moon Stone. Have you found one?
Oww!
I could have made my Pokémon evolve with a Moon Stone. I would have won then, I bet.
Electricity is my specialty, so I don't know a thing about Pokémon of the sea.
Unplugged!
Water conducts electricity, so you should zap Pokémon from the sea.
The fishing fool versus Pokémon kid!
A touch too much to handle!
I guess you get to be good at what you like. Well, you beat me at Pokémon, but you can't top me at fishing.
I love fishing—don't get me wrong. But it'd be best if I also had more work.
It's not easy...
It's all right. Losing doesn't bug me.
What's biting? You never know what you could catch!
Lost it!
What—Magikarp? I catch them all the time, sure. But boy are they wimpy.











I'm told I'm good for a kid.
Ohh! I lost!
I want to become a good Trainer. I'll train hard—just watch.
Wow! Your Badges are too cool!
Not enough!
You got those Badges from Gym Leaders. I know!
My cute Pokémon wish to make your acquaintance.
Good going! You totally won!
You have to make Pokémon battle to toughen them up.
I gave my Pokémon a Quick Candy!
Oh, too bad! I just messed up!
If you give a Candy to your Pokémon, it can increase your Pokémon's stats, such as Speed.
I'm not going to lose. Not when the wind's blowing my way!
The wind turned!
I'm beat. I guess I'll go home.
Sure, I'll play with you, sweetie.
You're strong!
I wonder which are stronger, male or female Pokémon...
Do you want to battle some Pokémon with me?
It's over already?
I don't know anything about Pokémon, actually. I picked the ones I use for their looks!
What're you lookin' at?
Oh man! Stripped gears!
Get lost!
I always go with bird Pokémon. I've dedicated myself to them.
Out of power!
I wish I could fly like Pidgey and Pidgeotto...
You need to use TMs to teach good moves to your Pokémon if you want to make them strong.
Not good enough quite yet.
Your Pokémon can use Secret Techniques? That's amazing! Unlike with moves, it will never forget them!



You can buy TMs at the Celadon Department Store, too. Have you used TMs?
Aww, bummer!
Try teaching Pokémon a move that's the same type as it. That apparently boosts the power of the move.



Have you heard the legend of the winged mirages?
Why? Why'd I lose?
Well, the winged mirages are the legendary bird Pokémon. There are three of them: Articuno, Zapdos, and Moltres.
I'm not into it, but OK. Let's go!
I knew it!
Winning, losing... It's insignificant under this huge sky.
C'mon...c'mon. Let's go... Let's go... Let's go!
Argh! Lost! Get lost!
What... What... What? What do you want still?
I need to burn some time. Shut up and battle.
What? You?!
Raising Pokémon is a drag, man.
We come gather out here because of the wide-open spaces.
Wipeout!
It's cool you made your Pokémon so strong. Might is right! And you know it!
Pokémon battle? Cool! Rumble!
Blown away!
You know who'd win, you and me one-on-one!








I'll battle you with my favorite Pokémon that I traded with my friends!
Not good enough!
You can't change the nickname of any Pokémon you get in a trade, even if you don't like it. Only the original Trainer can get the nickname changed.
You look gentle, so I think I can beat you. I'll give it a go!
No... Wrong!
I'm afraid of Bikers. They look so ugly and mean!
When I whistle, I can summon bird Pokémon.
Ow! That's tragic!
Maybe I'm not cut out for battles. I'm not the right type, I guess...



Oh, you're a little cutie! So like a darling Pokémon!
I was caught off guard.
I forgive you. I can take it. I'm a big girl now.
I raise Pokémon for protection because I live alone.
Pokémon aren't about winning or losing for me.
I love having my Pokémon greet me when I get home. It's so reassuring.
Hey, kid! C'mon! I just got these off some loser!
I don't get it.
Life's too short. It's cool to live as an outlaw. Team Rocket rules!
Fork over all your cash when you lose to me, kid!
That can't be true!
I was just joking about the money. Don't take me all serious.
What's cool and happening? Trading Pokémon!
I said trade, not battle!
'Cause Pokémon you get by trade grow faster!
Want to play with my Pokémon?
I was too impatient!
I'll go train with weaker people.








What do you want?
Don't you dare laugh!
Mind your own business! I like hanging out here, OK? It's fun!
Nice Pokémon! Hand it over!
Knockout!
Forget it. Who needs your Pokémon!



Hey, you just bumped me!
Kaboom!
A long time ago, we used to ride bikes all up and down this route... Tch... So lame!



Whoa! You have a great Pokémon! Let me see!
The coat is so shiny...
Ahead is Pokémon Road. You can stroll or enjoy battles there.

















I leveled up my Pokémon, but it won't evolve. Why?
Why, you!
Maybe some Pokémon need certain stones to evolve.
I need a little exercise!
Whew! Good workout!
I'm sure I lost weight there!
Be a rebel!
Aaaargh!
Be ready to fight for your beliefs!



Please, would you have a battle with my babies?
Even if they lost, my babies are still cute...
Thank you for battling with my babies.
Where is a good-looking guy who is with a cute Pokémon?
Oops. Did I just say that aloud?
It makes it easier to talk to people if they have Pokémon with them.
Are you a bad kid or a good kid?
No, you're a great kid!
Pokémon Road used to be the Cycling Road, which wasn't very safe. But it got much safer once it became Pokémon Road.
Let me see your Pokémon! Please!
I'm happy now.
I'm so happy to be able to see different Pokémon of different people.
Do you want to battle my Pokémon?
Aahhh!
I'm looking for Pokémon friends!












I always check every grassy area like this for new Pokémon.
Tch!
I wish I knew how to ride a Pokémon.
Kurukkoo! How do you like my birdcall?
I should have stayed quiet.
The ocean's close by, so I come on the weekends to enjoy the sea breeze with my Pidgeot!
This is my turf! Get out of here!
Bah!
This is my fave area for catching Pokémon.
I have to exercise and warm up before going out for a swim.
All warmed up!
Thanks, kid! I'm ready for a swim.
Wait! Slow down! You'll have a heart attack!
Ooh! That's chilly!
Watch out for Tentacool. They sting so painfully.



What's beyond the horizon?
No land in sight!
I see a couple of islands over yonder!
I tried diving for Pokémon from the sea, but it was a no-go.
Help!
I heard there's a move in another region that lets you dive underneath the water.



Oh, I just love what you're riding! You'll give it to me if I win, right?
Oh! I lost!
It's still a long way to the Seafoam Islands... I want to go back to Fuchsia City...
Swimming's great! Sunburns aren't!
Shocker!
My boyfriend wanted to swim to the Seafoam Islands.
Ahoy there! These waters are treacherous!
Ooh! Dangerous!
M-my legs! They cramped up! Urgh!
I swam here with my friends... I'm tired...
I'm exhausted...
If I were to ride a Pokémon on the sea, I'd like it to be a Lapras. Lapras is so big, I bet it would keep me dry on water.











The Seafoam Islands are a quiet getaway. I'm vacationing here.
Quit it!
There's a huge cavern underneath this island.
I love floating here among the waves. ...I'm a fish Pokémon.
Yowch!
Want to float with me?
Are you on vacation, too?
No mercy at all!
Seafoam used to be a single island in the distant past.
Check out my buff physique!
Wimpy!
I should've been buffing up my Pokémon, not me!
Wow, you're riding on the water! ...Could it be you can't swim?
Ouch! Torpedoed!
Riding on the water like you do instead of swimming sure looks fun!
I rode my bird Pokémon here.
Oh no! Now what am I to do?
My bird Pokémon are exhausted. They can't fly me back!
My boyfriend gave me big pearls.
Oh no! My pearls were in that Pokémon!
Will my pearls grow bigger inside Cloyster?
I swam here from Cinnabar Island. It wasn't easy, I tell you.
I'm so disappointed!
Pokémon have taken over an abandoned mansion on Cinnabar Island. They call it the Pokémon Mansion now.
Cinnabar Island, to the west, has a lab for Pokémon. My daddy works there.
Wait! You're supposed to wait!
Cinnabar Island is volcanic. I heard it rose out of the sea when a volcano erupted.
You want to know if the fish are biting?
Oh man!
I can't catch anything good. Not one good Pokémon to be had!
I got a big haul! Wanna go for it?
Heheh... Magikarp just don't make the grade, do they.
I seem to only catch Magikarp!
The sea cleanses my body and soul!
Ahhh!
The sea is great and all, but I like the mountains, too.
I caught my Pokémon at sea.
Diver! Down!
Where'd you catch your Pokémon?
Right now, I'm in a triathlon meet.
*pant pant pant*
I'm beat! But, I still have the bike race and marathon left!
Ahh! Feel the sun and the wind!
Yow! I lost!
I'm sunburnt to a crisp!
Hey, don't disturb the water!
Sorry! I thought you were disturbing the water.
I can't fish like a Fisherman. Could this place actually be a giant pool or something?
Keep me company till I get a hit.
That burned some time.
Oh wait... I got a bite! Yeah!
What's wrong with me swimming?
Cheap shot!
I look like what? A studded inner tube? Get lost!








I saw your feat from the grass!
I thought not!
I hid because the people on the bridge frightened me.
OK! I'm number five! I'll stomp you!
Whoa! Too much!
I did my best. I have no regrets!
I'm number four! Getting tired?
I lost, too!
I did my best, so I've no regrets!
Here's number three! I won't be easy!
Ow! Stomped flat!
I did my best. I have no regrets!
I'm second! Now it's serious!
How could I lose?
I did my best, so I've got no regrets!
People call this the Nugget Bridge! Beat us five Trainers, and win a fabulous prize! Think you got what it takes?
Woo! Good stuff!
I did my best. I have no regrets!
Local Trainers come here to practice.
You're decent.
All Pokémon have weaknesses. Even the strongest ones. That's why it's best to raise Pokémon of different types.
Dad took me to a great party being held on the S.S. Anne at Vermilion Port. It was fun!
I'm not mad!
On the S.S. Anne, I saw Trainers from around the world.
I'm a Camper. My girlfriend is a Picnicker.
Aww, man...
Oh well. My girlfriend will cheer me up.
I'm a Picnicker. My boyfriend is a Camper.
My conditioning isn't the best...
I wish my boyfriend were as strong as you.
I had this feeling... I knew I had to battle you!
I knew I'd lose, too!
If your Pokémon gets confused, switch it out. That's a good tactic.
My friend has many cute Pokémon. I'm so jealous!
I'm not jealous at all!
You came from Mt. Moon? May I have a Clefairy?
I just got down from Mt. Moon, but I've still got gas in the tank!
You worked hard!
Drat! A Zubat bit me back in that cave.
I'm off to see that Pokémon fanatic guy at the cape!
You done got me—and real good, too!
The Pokémon fanatic sure lives up to his name. Seems he knows about many rare Pokémon.
You're going to see Bill? First, we battle!
You're something.
The trail below is a shortcut to Cerulean City.

Stop! I give up! I'll leave quietly!

































































































































































































































































*pant pant* That was a truly intense fight.





Heh! You must be running out of steam by now!
I ran out of gas!
You'll need power to keep up with our Gym Leader.



Pokémon and I, we make wonderful music together!
You are in perfect harmony!
Do you know the identity of our Gym Leader?



A truly strong Trainer wins with style!
I lost my grip!
The Gym Leader will scold me for losing this way...
I'm the Karate King! Your fate rests with me!
Ayah!
The Pokémon League? You? Don't get cocky!
Your Pokémon will cower at the crack of my whip!
Yowch! Whiplash!
Wait! I only lost because I underestimated you!
The Viridian City Gym was closed for a long time. But now, our Gym Leader is back!
I was beaten?
If you beat the Viridian City Gym Leader, you'll be able to proceed to the Pokémon League.

It seems I underestimated you.





Stop right there, kid! You're ten thousand light-years from facing Brock!
Oops! Light-years isn't time... It measures distance!
You're pretty hot...but not as hot as Brock!
This is the Pewter City Gym! Trainers here are a bit different from those you've faced so far.
You're quite different from the challengers I've faced!
Was it your first Gym battle? You don't look it, but you have a lot of guts.





Wow! You're too much!






Appearing in a glamourous flash! My Pokémon will totally stomp you!
Blub blub...
I used up all my energy with my fantastic dive.
Hm? Me? I'm a beautiful girl who glides on the water!
I'm soaked!
My tears are making the pool water even saltier!
Did you see that dive just now? Don't you think it's deserving of a gold medal?
Your Pokémon totally deserves a gold medal!
This Gym's pool uses water from the ocean.






Now that's a shocker! You're the real deal, kid!
When I was in the army, Lt. Surge was my strict CO. He was a hard taskmaster.
Stop! You're very good!
Are you having trouble reaching Lt. Surge? Why don't you check a trash can next to the blue trash can?
I'm a lightweight, but I'm good with electricity! That's why I joined this Gym.
Fried!
OK, I'll talk! I heard there isn't a switch in any trash cans next to the red trash can!
This is no place for kids! Not even if you're good at Pokémon!
Wow! Surprised me!
Let me give you a hint for the double barriers. After you push the first switch, you need to push the second switch right after. The two switches are adjacent to each other.

Blast!


Oh! I concede defeat. You are remarkably strong.





Ahhhh. You're the one who I saw earlier! I'll show you my cute Pokémon!
You're too rough!
Nyahhh! I hope Erika wipes you out!
Oh, welcome. I was getting bored.
Give me a break.
Grass-type Pokémon are tough against Water-type Pokémon. They also have an edge on Rock- and Ground-type Pokémon.
...Weren't you peeking in here earlier?
I don't want to see myself lose!
Oh, you were looking at Erika... You weren't looking at me...
Look, look! See my Pokémon! I like the Grass type. I like how they're easy to raise.
No!
We only use Grass-type Pokémon at our Gym. Why? We also use them for making flower arrangements!
Oh, hey! We don't like Bug- or Fire-type Pokémon in here!
Oh! You!
Our Gym Leader, Erika, might be quiet, but she's famous around here.
What's your hobby...? ...Yes! Let's battle Pokémon!
Oh! Splendid!
I have a blind date coming up. I have to learn to be graceful, even if I'm asked to have a Pokémon battle.
Welcome to the Celadon City Gym! You'd better not underestimate the nice ladies here.
Oh! Beaten!
I didn't bring my best Pokémon today. Wait until next time!

Hmph! You have proven your worth!





Strength isn't the only key for Pokémon. Do you understand this? Pokémon battles are about strategy! I'll show you how strategy can beat brute strength.
What? Extraordinary!
So, you mix brawn with brains? Good strategy! That's remarkable for a child Trainer.
I was a magician once upon a time. But I dreamed of becoming a ninja, so I joined this Gym.
I'm done for!
Even though I've lost, I will keep training according to the teachings of Koga, my ninja master.
Let's see you beat my special techniques!
You had me fooled!
I like poison and sleep effects, as they linger after battle!
Stop right there! What do you think about the famed invisible walls of the Fuchsia City Gym?
Whoa! You've got it!
You impressed me! Here's a hint! Look very closely for gaps in the invisible walls!
I also study the way of the ninja with Master Koga! Ninja have a long history of using creatures!
Awoo!
I still have much to learn.
Master Koga descended from a family of ninja. A tradition that's lasted for hundreds of years! What did you descend from?
You're more skilled than I'd thought!
Where there is light, there is shadow! Light and shadow! Which do you choose?

I have burned down to nothing! Not even ashes remain!






Combustion occurs when the oxygen in the air— *mumble mumble...grumble grumble*


I surrender!








I heard when Blaine suffered an accident and got lost in the mountains, a fiery bird Pokémon appeared and rescued him by lighting up a dark path.


Yowza! Too hot!





Hwa! Argh! Beaten!


Hyargh! You! Are you a challenger?
I give up!
You wait till you see our master! I'm a small fry compared to him!
I hear you're good! I won't hold back!
Judge! One point!
Our master is a pro fighter. Be prepared to lose!
Hiyah! I have no fear for anything tough! I shatter boulders for training every day!
Yow! Stubbed fingers!
The only thing that frightens us is psychic power! ...Oh, and things that fly around. ...And fairies. But that's it!
Hwaah! You're trespassing in our Fighting Dojo!
Oof! I give up!
The prime fighters across the land train here.

This loss shocks me! But a loss is a loss... I admit I didn't work hard enough to win.





Sabrina is younger than me... but she has earned my respect!
Regrettably, I have lost.
In a battle of equals, the one with the stronger will wins. If you wish to beat Sabrina, focus and will yourself to victory.
Are you scared of psychics that use unseen power?
I never foresaw this!
What are Psychic types afraid of? Well, there are a few things, I guess... Ghost types and Bug types. Oh...and Dark types, too.
You...must be a lost Trainer!
Lost and yet so strong...
You're lost but still trying to reach the Gym Leader, right? Try aiming for higher platforms.



You and I—our Pokémon shall battle!
I lost after all!
I knew that this was going to take place. Yes! This ability is called precognition!
Sabrina is young, but she's also our highly skilled Gym Leader. I won't let you reach her easily!
Ow! Down and out!
There used to be two Gyms in Saffron City. The Fighting Dojo next door lost its Gym status, though. We simply creamed them when we decided to have just one Gym.
The Saffron City Pokémon Gym is famous for training psychics. You want to see Sabrina, don't you? I can tell!
Arrrgh!
That's right! The ability to read people's minds is called telepathy!
What?! Did I lose?
What?! Did I lose?
Whoa, seriously?
Whoa, seriously?
I can't believe it!
A twerp beat us?
Phew... OK, I feel a bit calmer now...
Phew... OK, I feel a bit calmer now...
Wh-whoa! I can't believe it!
Wh-whoa! I can't believe it!
Maybe your Pokémon are doing a little TOO well...
Maybe your Pokémon are doing a little TOO well...
Such a dreadful twerp!
But I was so confident this time!
What a blunder!
What do you want?
You'll regret this!

Exactly what I'd expect from a Pallet Town Trainer!
Gaaah... Again?!
Wha—?!


As always...
Argh! I hate kids!
I've raised my Pokémon up this much... and still I can't beat you, huh?
I've raised my Pokémon up this much... and still I can't beat you, huh?
OK! I admit it! <var>, you're the strongest Trainer in the world!
OK! I admit it! <var>, you're the strongest Trainer in the world!
With my current skills, I was not up to the task after all.
Come on! What's with that...?
I'm shocked at your strength!
I'm shocked at your strength!
How did it end up like this?
It's not fair that you always win!
Argh! You are good!
What?! This can't be!
Argh! I lost again?!
...Things shouldn't be this way!
Why? How could I lose?
Oh my! You're something special, child!
That's it! I hate to admit it, but you are a first-class Pokémon Trainer!
I knew you were strong, but this...
Hmph! How annoying!
Absolutely shocking!
Oh! It appears it is my loss... ... ... ...
I won't encounter a Trainer like you for around another three years.
...If I am not strong enough to defeat you now, there is but one thing to do. I must hone my skills.
Hah! I'm all fired up!
Aw man, what was I doing?


Argh! How?!
I have regrets!
Not bad!
How could I be pushed to such a point?
I knew it! Battling with you is the most fun, <var>!
I knew it! Battling with you is the most fun, <var>!
You are good!
You won't have any trouble going through Mt. Moon!
Am I the one who was coached?!
You're strong!
Way to go, youngster!
*tremble tremble* I tremble at your strength!
It was a great session!
I'm totally defeated!
Fascinating!
You're strong! You're great!
Now I've trained you, too!
Seriously strong. So sick!
Well done!
Both you and I did a great job!
Wow! I'm surprised.
Overwhelming!
That move you used at that point in the battle... I never saw it coming!
Is this the power of the top Trainer?
When it comes down to it, you are still the strongest... Haha, what am I saying...
Trainers' eyes have met! I'll battle you with my favorite Pokémon!
You're really strong!
I'm sure there are lots of other Trainers on routes or in the forest that will want to battle you!
Oh, you have a partner Pokémon! Let me get a better look!
Before I knew it, I lost!
Maybe I should pick up another Weedle...
Hey, do you know if Bulbasaur appear in this forest?
Could you listen to what I have to say, please?
I heard from a friend that they saw Bulbasaur around here. It wasn't registered to their Pokédex, though. I wonder if it was true.
What if the boss hears about this?!

I'm all about swim trunks! You could say they're my identity.
Puah!
Is that Pokémon you're on wearing swim trunks?
Have a battle with me in this hidden place!
I lost...but no one was watching us, right?
Recently I was a coach, but I realized that being an Ace Trainer was best!
Your partner sure is cute! Let's have a battle!
I've got to stop being fooled by cuteness...
All right, time to form a plan to distract other Trainers with cuteness.
I can catch a lot of Pokémon around here, so buzz off!
You didn't buzz off.
When you're trying to catch a Pokémon, using a second Berry will remove the effect of the first Berry you used!
How many Gym Badges do you have?
Uh-oh... You were stronger than I thought.
There's a Gym over in Celadon City! Do you plan on going?
You're going to help me get stronger!
Can this be real?
I couldn't beat Blaine, so I've been training here.
