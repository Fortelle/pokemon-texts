Catch Combo: <var>
OAK: My, my... I surely wouldn't have expected <var> to appear around here! But since the opportunity has presented itself... why don't we practice some Pokémon catching? You just have to throw out your Poké Ball and try to land it on a wild Pokémon for the chance to catch it!
OAK: It can be a bit trickier than it sounds, wouldn't you say? I'll give you some more Poké Balls, so give it another go!
