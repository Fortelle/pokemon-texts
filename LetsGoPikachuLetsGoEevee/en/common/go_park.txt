About Bringing Pokémon
About the GO Park Complex
About the Play Yard
You can bring your Pokémon from Pokémon GO to a GO Park. First, go to Options in the main menu and select Open Pokémon GO Settings. This will allow you to pair your game with a Pokémon GO account. Next, select the Pokémon you want to send. Note that once you bring a Pokémon to a GO Park, it cannot be sent back to Pokémon GO.
You will find the Pokémon brought from Pokémon GO playing in a GO Park. Go and speak to a Pokémon to try to catch it or to move it to a different GO Park. Once you catch a Pokémon in a GO Park, you will not be able to return it to a GO Park. If you want to leave a GO Park, press the X Button.
If you have 25 of the same species of Pokémon in the GO Park complex, you will be able to use the Play Yard. Guide your Pokémon to the goal at the top of the yard! If you are able to guide all your Pokémon to the goal within the time limit, you win! Be careful of the Pokémon that pop up from the ground, though—they can get in your way. If you want to stop playing, press the X Button.
