Hello there! Glad to meet you! Welcome to the world of Pokémon! My name is Oak. People affectionately refer to me as the Pokémon Professor.

This world is inhabited far and wide by creatures called Pokémon.
And if you want to know how people tend to interact with these Pokémon...
Well, some people keep them as companions. Others have them do battle...
As for myself...
I study Pokémon as a profession.
Now, why don't you tell me about yourself!
What do you look like?
And how about a name, hmm?

Right... So your name is <var>?
This boy here is your friend and rival who has grown up right next door to you. What was his name, now?
What is your rival's name?
It was <var>, was it?
Mm-hmm. I see! His name is <var>!
<var>, my boygirl!
Your very own Pokémon tale is about to unfold!
Yes, a world of dreams and adventures with Pokémon awaits!
Let's go!
Yes
