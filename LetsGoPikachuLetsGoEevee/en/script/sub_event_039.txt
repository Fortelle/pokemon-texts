I just caught a Squirtle that was always getting into mischief. I think it needs a good Trainer to set it straight.
Wow, you've caught <var> Pokémon!
You must be a great Trainer! I have a favor to ask you. Would you take care of this troublesome Squirtle?
OK! Please take good care of Squirtle!
How about I talk to you about it when you've caught at least <var> Pokémon...
Oh... What am I to do now?
How is Squirtle doing?
SQUIRTLE: Squirt.
