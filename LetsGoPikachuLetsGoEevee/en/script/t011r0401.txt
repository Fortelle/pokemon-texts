RECEPTIONIST: Oh, welcome! Are you here to meet the president? You'll find him in the boardroom on 11F!
"Silph Co. Head Office 1F"
I heard that the ones who took on Team Rocket were actually some kids! Wait, could it be you...? No, no, couldn't be...
Any kind of tool can be used for good or evil, depending on the person using it. I shudder to think what would have happened if Team Rocket had gotten their hands on Silph technology...
I came back from playing hooky only to find out the company had been taken over! That was quite a surprise, for sure.
A lot of work's piled up, so we need to get cracking!
I was captured by Team Rocket. I wonder if our insurance plan covers that kind of thing...?
