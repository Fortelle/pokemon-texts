OAK: Hey! Where do you think you're going? Back over here, young manlady!

<var>: Professor Oak! Those Poké Balls there—I swear there were only two a second ago, but now there are three!
OAK: A perfectly reasonable reaction, my boy! You see, one of them is <var> that <var> caught just now.
<var>: So, wait, <var>... You caught it yourself?
Wha—?! I've never seen that happen before!
OAK: Hohoho! How interesting!
Well, my boygirl, this is it! Take that Poké Ball— and keep good hold of it this time!
Go on! <var> is yours now!
I think the Pokémon you caught is in the middle Poké Ball, <var>.
<var>: I think it's trying to tell you you're going for the wrong one, pal!
