Pewter City: A Stone Gray City
Pewter Museum of Science
Pewter City Pokémon Gym Gym Leader: Brock The Rock-Solid Pokémon Trainer!
Trainer Tips All the Pokémon in your team can earn Exp. Points, even if they don't fight in a battle. But if you do switch them into a battle, even just for a moment, they'll get more Exp. Points!
There's a notice posted here... "There have been reports recently of thieves stealing valuable Pokémon Fossils on Mt. Moon. "Please call the Pewter Police if you have any information or see anything suspicious."
Have you heard the stories that say Clefairy come from the moon? People started seeing them after Moon Stones fell on Mt. Moon.
There aren't many serious Pokémon Trainers here in Pewter City. They're all Bug Catchers and the like. You know, just hobbyists. But Brock at the Pewter City Gym isn't like that— not one bit.
Did you check out the museum already?
The display of those Fossils found on Mt. Moon was really something, wasn't it?
Really? You absolutely have to go!

Pssssssssst! Do you know what I'm doing?
That's right—anyone can tell just by looking! And it's hard work, too!
I'm spraying Repel around to keep wild Pokémon out of my flower beds!

I'm spraying Lure around to get wild Pokémon to come visit my flower beds!
CATERPIE: Pi?
This is my sweet little Fre! When she walks with me, she sometimes finds items in the field!
FRE: Freee!
Ahhh, it's so refreshing... Pewter City stays lovely and cool since it lies at the base of the mountain.
GEODUDE: Duuude...
You should be careful with your money. Don't go blowing it all in one place. But it's also fun sometimes to buy a whole bunch of Poké Balls at once! Hahaha!
Wow... I wanna do that! I wanna ride on a Pokémon!
