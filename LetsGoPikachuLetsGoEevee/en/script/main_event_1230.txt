BLUE: Congrats, kid! Boy, though, what a shock...
I never thought a criminal would use a Pokémon Gym as their hideout... ... ... ... That's it! I've decided!
I'll look after the Viridian City Gym from now on! I don't really like to get tied down, so I've always said no when they ask about it, but... I'm finally ready. I'll be the Gym Leader from now on.
That's great!
I want to battle you!
Thanks! With an awesome Trainer like me around, I'm pretty sure the Kanto region'll be safe from troublemakers like Team Rocket forever!
Huh? I mean, sure, but I think you've got a bigger challenge to face right now.
So then, <var>... Time for you to take on the Pokémon League! Just keep going along Route 22 to the west of here, and you won't miss it. The Elite Four are tough opponents, but don't you dare lose!
BLUE: The first challenger I'll have here... I'm sure it's gonna be <var>! I'm gonna show that little upstart how it's done!
