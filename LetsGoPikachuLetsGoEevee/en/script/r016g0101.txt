Pokémon Road is a downhill path leading to sea. You should try having a nice little hike along it with your favorite Pokémon!
There are certain Pokémon that will fly while carrying their Trainer on their back. Because Pokémon Road is so wide and safe, it's possible to fly particularly freely there, too.
