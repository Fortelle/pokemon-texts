Sweet! This kid says he'll trade me a Kangaskhan for my Haunter!
Come to me, my new Haunter! I absolutely love Haunter! I collect them! ...Huh? Haunter evolved into a different Pokémon while it was being traded?!
You can tell which Pokémon you got from other people because their IDs are different.
It's a Nintendo Switch!
Oooh, it's a role-playing game! ...Not that you've got any time for that!
A sports game! I bet Dad would like that!
Look, a puzzle game! Seems like the type that would be hard to quit.
A fighting game! It looks pretty difficult!
