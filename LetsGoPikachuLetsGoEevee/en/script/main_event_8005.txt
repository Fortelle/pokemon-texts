Hiya! You're here to challenge the Gym, aren't you? I'm not a Trainer, but I can tell if you're worthy of challenging the Gym Leader. Now, let's get started...
The Pewter City Gym only allows Trainers who know type matchups to enter! There are a few types that have an advantage against the Gym Leader's Rock-type Pokémon. But for Trainers who have never challenged a Gym before, we have them use either Grass- or Water-type Pokémon! You have to show me a Grass- or Water-type Pokémon if you want to face the Gym Leader!
Great! That Pokémon is exactly what I wanted to see. Head on in! And aim to become a Pokémon Champion!
...Do you not have one? You can find Grass-type Pokémon near Pallet Town. Come back once you've caught the Pokémon you need. The Pewter City Gym will be waiting!
