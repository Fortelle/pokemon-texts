Don't touch the posters at the Game Corner! There're no secret switches behind any of them!
That game where the Pokémon fly through the sky is a huge hit! We're positively raking in the cash now! I feel like I'm on cloud nine!
Maybe if we offered Pokémon as prizes to the top scorers, we could make even more money... Huh? What? I wasn't talking to you, kid!
