MR. FUJI: ... ... ...
Oh? And who might you be?
You came to save me from Team Rocket? Thanks, but I didn't even notice they were here. I was too busy trying to calm the spirit of Marowak.
I think Marowak's spirit has finally left us. I must thank you for your kind concern.
Follow me to my home. It's the Pok√©mon House, at the foot of this tower.
