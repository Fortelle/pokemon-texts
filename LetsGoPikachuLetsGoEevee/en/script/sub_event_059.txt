Heh heh heh... I am Madam Celadon. I am the one who can look into your future and see the encounters that are to come...
Shall I foresee the Nature of those fateful allies you have yet to meet? I'll charge you just â‚½10,000. Wouldn't you like to know your fate?
Yes, please!
No, thanks
Heh heh heh... If fate leads you back here, let us meet again.
You don't have enough dough. ...Dough means money, kid.
Well then, let me ask you a few questions.
There are five flowers of different colors in front of you. Which flower do you water?
Red
Yellow
Blue
Green
Pink
I want to quit
Heh. I see, I see... Now, among the five flowers I mentioned earlier, which one will you thin out if you have to?
Understood... Now I will look into your future.
Meeting, greeting, every time so fleeting! Hello, good-bye, every day beneath the sky!
Nay-cha, hey-cha, wouldn't wanna day-cha! Abra! Kadabra! Nature is so fab-wha!
ABRA: ...Synchero!
Fate is guiding your path. The encounters you will have this day are likely to have... Yes! <var> Nature!
And now I'll take your payment. I wish you good fortune.
You want to say good-bye? Heh heh heh... That is also a part of our fate.
ABRA: ...Syn.
