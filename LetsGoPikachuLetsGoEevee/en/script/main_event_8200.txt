<var>: You did it, <var>! Oh man, that's great... I've been waiting!
I beat the Elite Four and became the Champion!
You probably heard from the professor, right? From now on, the Champion will be part of the Pok√©mon League and battle all kinds of Trainers!
I'm really glad my first opponent turned out to be you, <var>!
You're the one Trainer I want to test my best against, after all!
Let's battle, <var>! The Champion's seat is on the line!
<var>: I've been waiting for you... Champion!
I've been training every day to try to beat you, <var>! And I'm not gonna lose today! Let's battle!
