Shh! Listen, I need to share a secret with someone. I think that this chunk of amber contains Pokémon DNA! It would be a shattering scientific breakthrough if Pokémon could be resurrected from it. But my colleagues just ignore what I have to say. So I have a favor to ask! I want you to get this examined at a Pokémon Lab somewhere.

Shh! Get the Old Amber checked!
What's this? Could it be you resurrected that Aerodactyl from the amber?! Oh, thank you! You've proven that my hypothesis was correct!
DNA is so amazing! You should study it, too!
