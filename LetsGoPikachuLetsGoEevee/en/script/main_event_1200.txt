<var>: ...Huh? Why's the door locked?
Open sesame!
Huh. Yeah, I guess that isn't gonna work...
Man...
Oh! Hey, <var>! Sheesh, say something if you're standing there! Watching me act all embarrassing like that...
Well, never mind that! So, how many Gym Badges you got these days?
...S-seven?! Then it looks like we're even! All that's left now is the Viridian City Gym... Same for you, right? But this place is never open...
I guess we've gotta tell someone that we haven't been able to get into the Gym... But who should we talk to?
Professor Oak
<var>
That old man there
OLD MAN: What?! Me?! I don't know anything about a thing like that...
<var>: O-of course you wouldn't! Sorry about that... We'll think it over ourselves!
Yeah, that's what I was thinking, too. Let's go see if he knows anything!
Piiika! Pika pika!
Veeeeee! Eevee!
<var>: Uh-huh... Uh-huh... Makes sense... If I could understand anything you said! This is getting us nowhere...
