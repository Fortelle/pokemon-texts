Hey, <var>! Would you like to know how much your Pokémon like you?
Hey, <var>! Would you like to know how much your Pokémon like you?
Pokémon will grow to love their Trainer if they're treated with love and care, you know!
In that case, let me see how <var> is doing!
<var> really, really, really loves you! I can tell you really trust each other!
I can tell <var> really likes you. It's saying it wants to always be with you!
It seems like <var> likes being with you!
You're really starting to get friendly! I'm sure you'll be best friends in no time.
Seems like it's starting to like you! I'm excited to see how you two grow.
Oh, I guess you just met, huh? Well, I'm looking forward to seeing you become fast friends!
Maybe it gets KO'd a lot in battles...?
Oh no! Why are you talking to me? You should take it to a Pokémon Center right away!
