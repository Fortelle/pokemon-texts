What?! Team Rocket is at Mt. Moon? Huh? I'm on the phone! Scram!
I really want a Pikachu, so I'm trading my Clefairy for one.
I'm trading Pokémon with the girl next to me. I had two Pikachu, so I figured I might as well trade one.
The Pewter City Gym Leader, Brock, is a Rock-type Pokémon user! Rock-type Pokémon are weak to Grass- and Water-type moves. If you don't pay attention to type matchups, you can't defeat the Gym Leader.
There's a flyer titled "Pokémon Center News."
Will you read it?
"Please be careful of a group of people calling themselves Team Rocket. "They have been known to steal people's Pokémon and use Pokémon for evil deeds. "Please stay away from anyone who has a big R on their clothing. "To our readers who are strong Trainers, please do not respond to any attempts they might make to recruit you."
