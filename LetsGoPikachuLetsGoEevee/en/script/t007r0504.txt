I'm getting a present for my girlfriend... Hmm... I could give her a Water Stone, but who knows? It might cause her to evolve!
There are Pok√©mon that evolve when you use an Evolution stone on them!
Grrr...
It looks like your <var> wants to stick with you just the way it is.
They don't sell them here, but I've heard there are these amazing stones called Mega Stones out there somewhere.
