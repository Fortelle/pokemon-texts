OAK: Oh! Just one more thing!
Now that you two are setting out as Trainers, I'd like to ask your help with something. Take this with you on your journeys.
<var>: What is that thing, Professor?
OAK: This is the Pokédex that I've designed! It automatically records data on Pokémon you've seen or caught, and it makes an entry for each. It's an extremely high-tech tool!
<var> and <var>... I want you each to take one with you!
You got a Pokédex from Professor Oak!
OAK: You'll find you can't get very detailed data on Pokémon by just seeing them. You must catch a Pokémon to gather the most complete data!
To make a complete guide to all the Pokémon in the world... That was my dream!
But I'm an old man now! Too old to get the job done myself.
That's why I want you young Trainers to fulfill my dream for me!
Get moving, you two! This is a great undertaking in Pokémon history!
<var>: A Pokédex, huh? We're gonna meet so many Pokémon... This keeps getting better and better!
I'm setting out right now! <var>, you should do the same... If you think you're ready, that is!
OAK: Pokémon are out there waiting for you— the whole world over, <var>!
