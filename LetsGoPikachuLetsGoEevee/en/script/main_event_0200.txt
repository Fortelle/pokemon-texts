Hey, stop!
I found these Fossils!
They're both mine!

Fine, we'll each take a Fossil... It's no good being greedy, right?
Do you want to take the Dome Fossil?
Do you want to take the Helix Fossil?
You got the Helix Fossil!
You got the Dome Fossil!
All right, then the other Fossil is mine!
It's really far away from here, but apparently there's a lab on Cinnabar Island where they're doing research on reviving Fossils.
