A Pokémon is sprawled out in a deep and comfortable slumber.
Do you want to use the Poké Flute?
You played the Poké Flute.
Snorlax woke up!
Snorlax is looking at you... And it looks hungry!
???: Hey, <var>!
MR. FUJI: There's something I forgot to mention when I gave you the Poké Flute...
...Oh! Perfect timing!
You see, this Pokémon is called Snorlax. It's been known to attack the first thing it sees after waking up. It thinks what it sees is food!
Since it can be pretty dangerous, please help it calm down by battling it with your Pokémon.
Once you defeat it, it'll become more docile. You should be able to catch it, just like any other Pokémon!
Snorlax mistook you for food and attacked!
Snorlax calmed down. It gave a huge yawn... and returned to the mountains.
MR. FUJI: Oh my, <var>! That was impressive!
MR. FUJI: Oh, too bad, <var>...
There are other Pokémon out there that will try to attack Trainers, just as Snorlax did. When facing such a Pokémon, the best thing to do is to defeat it, then catch it. Remember—defeat, then catch. In that order!
Well, I'll see you later, then!
