<var>: Hi! Do you like Pokémon? <var>: Uh, no, I just asked you. <var>: Huh? You're strange! COPYCAT: Hmm? Quit mimicking? But that's my favorite hobby!
<var>: Hi. You must like Pokémon. <var>: No, not me. I asked you. <var>: Pardon? You're weird! COPYCAT: Hmm? Quit mimicking? But that's my favorite hobby!
COPYCAT: Oh, it's you! Are you here to let me mimic you again?
COPYCAT: Oh, hey! Do you want me to mimic you again?
You have a Clefairy with you. Do you want to show it to Copycat?
Oh wow! A real-life Clefairy! I've never seen one before! Thank you so much! You know what? I'll give you a TM that lets your Pokémon create a copy of itself!

TM08 contains the move Substitute! It lets your Pokémon create a decoy of itself by spending HP!


<var>: Hi! Thanks for earlier! <var>: Pardon? <var>: Hmph! Is it that fun to mimic everything I say? COPYCAT: You bet! It's a scream!
<var>: Hi! Thanks for what you did for us. <var>: Pardon? <var>: Wha—? Is it really that fun to copy what I say and do? COPYCAT: You bet! It's a scream!
