You're a Trainer, too? Collecting Pokémon, battling with Pokémon... It's a tough life, isn't it?
There's a tree growing in front of the Poké Mart. It's blocking the way to the route to the south! I think there's a long way around, though...

You're making some sort of encyclopedia of Pokémon? That sounds like a fun time!
What a shame... The people here were robbed! Someone even saw the thieves escape, and they say it was none other than Team Rocket! To protect the poor owners of this house from further harm, I won't be letting anyone in! Not even a little Rattata will sneak past me!
OK, Electrode! Use Sonic Boom! Awww, come on, Elec! I wish you'd listen to my orders!
Electrode! Use Tackle! Now! D'aww... Failed again?
Electrode! Use Swift! No, no, not that move! Oooh, Pokémon are so hard to control! They say it's up to your skill as a Trainer whether your Pokémon listen to you or not.
Electrode is taking a snooze...
Electrode is loafing around...
Electrode turned away!
Electrode is ignoring orders...
You know the guy who lives in that house there? He's collected bikes from all over the world!
This is the Cerulean Cave. Frightfully strong Pokémon live inside. You'd have to be a very special Trainer to be allowed in—a Champion recognized by the Pokémon League, in fact!
