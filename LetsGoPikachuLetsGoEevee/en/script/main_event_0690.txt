JESSIE: We came all the way to Lavender Town on the boss's orders, but...
Where in the world is this old man Fuji supposed to be?
JAMES: The only place left is that spooky old Pokémon Tower, right?
JESSIE: That's right... We couldn't get to the top because of that strange ghost getting in the way.
JAMES: Well, we couldn't find that old man, but at least we found this Cubone! Let's get it back to our hideout. At least we'll have something to show for our trouble.
JESSIE: Right! Let's head to the Rocket Game Corner in Celadon City!
CUBONE: Maaa?
JESSIE: Aww, does the wittle Cubone want its mommy? Your mommy's in Celadon City. Come with us. We'll take you there.
CUBONE: Maa! Maa!
Now that that's decided, I think we'd better blast off!
I-I just saw something awful...
Hey, did you see?! Team Rocket abducted that poor Cubone!
It sounded like they were headed to Celadon City, but...
They must be planning on taking the skull bone it wears and selling it at a high price!
You rescued that Cubone from Team Rocket?! Wow, that's pretty amazing!
Take these, as a thank-you!
You got 20 Great Balls!
I bet someone brave like you could go up the Pokémon Tower, no problem!
JESSIE: There! Come on! Almost got it... Aaah, so close!
JAMES: C'mon, Jessie, why don't we head to the hideout now?
JESSIE: Oh come on, we've already handed over the Cubone to another Team Rocket member. What's the harm in taking a little break? How were we supposed to open the hidden entrance to the hideout, anyway?
JAMES: We just need to check the poster with a vehicle on it, remember? It's a poster with a vehicle that's the best way to represent us!
JESSIE: What do you mean? What kind of vehicle is the best way to represent us?
JAMES: You know, those things that blast off into space?
MEOWTH: Mrowr.
