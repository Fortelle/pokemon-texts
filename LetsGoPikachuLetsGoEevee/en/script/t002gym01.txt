Yo! Champ in the making! Even I don't know who the Viridian City Gym Leader is. But one thing's certain: you're qualified to challenge the Gym Leader because you have seven Badges! This Gym Leader will be stronger than any other Trainers you've ever faced. Also, I heard that the Trainers here are users of Ground-type Pokémon.
That just blew my mind! Giovanni was the Gym Leader of Viridian City? It was too dark to tell!
A new Viridian City Gym Leader has arrived!
BLUE: Stopped by to say hello, huh? Don't you worry. Now that I'm a Gym Leader, I'm gonna make sure that all the Trainers in Kanto are up to my standard!
PERSIAN: Grrr...
