Team Rocket will do anything for the sake of money! There is no job too dirty, no deed too heinous, no crime too wicked!
I saw Cubone's mother trying to escape from Team Rocket. But she got caught... I was so scared that I couldn't even go to try to save her.
You know how Cubone wear skulls, right? From what I've heard, it seems people will pay a lot for one of those skulls.

A flyer is stuck between the magazines...
Will you read it?
"A word of gratitude from the Pokémon House! Two of our Pokémon were able to meet new Trainers and be adopted last month. "Our thanks to everyone in the community who helped make this possible! "We apologize for the noise the Pokémon make every day, but we hope you will all continue supporting the Pokémon House."
