BROCK: So, you're here. I'm Brock, Pewter City's Gym Leader.
You can see just by looking at my Pokémon how rock hard my willpower is. My Pokémon are all hard as rock and have true- grit determination!
That's right! My Pokémon are all Rock types!
Fwahaha! You're going to challenge me even knowing that you'll lose? That's what a Trainer's honor demands!
So be it! Show me your best!
BROCK: As proof of your victory, take an official Pokémon League Badge—a Boulder Badge!
You got a Boulder Badge from Brock!
BROCK: With a Boulder Badge, Pokémon up to Lv. 20 from other Trainers will listen to you without question! Oh...and wait! Take this with you, too.
You got <var> <var> from Brock!
BROCK: If you use a TM, or Technical Machine, you can teach your Pokémon the move within it. A TM can be used as many times as you like, so use it on any Pokémon you want. TM01 contains Headbutt. It deals damage to your opponent's Pokémon by ramming them with a head as hard as rock.
There are all kinds of people in this huge world of ours. Some have their Pokémon battle—some just like to raise them... I'm hard at work here to learn how to become a Pokémon Breeder, who helps raise Pokémon. You're aiming to become a strong Trainer, right? Then you should challenge all the other Gyms!
You're a Trainer, right? Brock's looking for new challengers. Follow me!
If you think you've got the right stuff, you should take on Brock!
Oh, wow, that's a Boulder Badge! You got it from Brock, didn't you? When you get new Gym Badges, more items become available to you in the Poké Mart!
By the way, the Poké Mart is that blue building!
Poké Marts are in lots of towns, though, so you probably already knew that, huh?
