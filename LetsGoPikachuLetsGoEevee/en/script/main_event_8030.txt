Hello... Lovely weather, isn't it?
It's so pleasant... ... ... ... ... ... Zzz.
...Oh dear. I must have dozed off.
Welcome. My name is Erika. I am the Gym Leader of the Celadon City Gym.
I am a student of the art of flower arranging. My Pokémon are all of the Grass type.
...Oh, I'm sorry. Did you perhaps wish to challenge me?
Very well... but I shall not lose.

I must confer on you a Rainbow Badge.
You got a Rainbow Badge from Erika!
A Rainbow Badge raises the level of Pokémon willing to listen to you to Lv. <var>, for Pokémon that you have received from other Trainers. And...here. If you'd like, please also take this with you.
You got <var> <var> from Erika!
TM53 contains Mega Drain. Half the damage it inflicts is drained from the target to heal your Pokémon. Wouldn't you agree that it's a wonderful move?
Oh my... So you are cataloging the Pokémon you catch? I must say I'm impressed. I myself would never collect a Pokémon if it were not beautiful.
