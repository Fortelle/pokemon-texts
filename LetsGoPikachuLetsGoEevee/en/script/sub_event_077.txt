LT. SURGE: Hey there, kid! Pretty shocking you made it through the Pokémon League! No doubt some Electric-type Pokémon had a pretty big hand in that, right? All right, then. How about you show me what kind of Pokémon you've raised!
LT. SURGE: No need for introductions this time! Trainers like us have no need for words! Let's go, kid!
LT. SURGE: Looks like there's still a gap between our skill levels I need to close, kid! This is the first time I've felt like this since I first arrived here in Kanto! Come back tomorrow!
