Oh dear. What a cute boygirl!
Are you heading up the Pokémon Tower? What a kind child you are! ...I have an idea! I bet the Pokémon here would be even happier to see you if you had a spiffy outfit on.
You got a Formal Set from the old lady!
You put the Formal Set in your Clothing Trunk!
Hello, dear. How did you like the outfit? I wanted you to wear it because you looked like my grandsondaughter.
