AGATHA: I am Agatha of the Elite Four.
I hear Oak's taken a lot of interest in you, child.
That old duff was once tough and handsome. But that was decades ago. He's a shadow of his former self.
Now he just wants to fiddle with his Pokédex. He's a fool.
Pokémon are for battling!
<var>! I'll show you how a real Trainer battles!

AGATHA: You win! I see what the old duff sees in you now.
I have nothing else to say. Run along now, child!
AGATHA: So, you've come! It's not in my character to lose over and over. Give this battle everything you've got!
AGATHA: Small wonder that old-timer's taken such an interest in you.
Oak and I used to be good rivals, too, you know. Just like you and <var>.
Well, what are you waiting for? Head on to the next room!
