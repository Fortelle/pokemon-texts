You look like someone who wants to try your own strength!
Do you want to have a Pokémon battle with me, a Coach Trainer?
Battle
Not now


OK! Here I come!
You won't battle? OK, maybe next time!
You defeated a Coach Trainer, just like that! In honor of your strength, I have a gift for you.
Revives will heal a Pokémon that's been knocked out—something that a Potion can't do! Be sure to use them wisely!
Hello there! I'm a Coach Trainer, at your service!
Do you want to train a bit before taking on Mt. Moon?

Are you ready?
I guess you didn't need to battle. OK. Next time!
That was a great battle! Take this, as thanks.
TM57 is for the move Pay Day. It's a move that'll scatter money around that you can pick up later for a little extra pocket money!
This area is popular for dates. I'm a proudly independent Coach Trainer at a date spot!
I'll let you know, I'm pretty strong. Want me to battle you?

I'll give you a real workout!
Let me know if you change your mind.
Whew, I haven't had fun like that in a long time! Here, take this!
TM15 is for Seismic Toss. It deals damage equal to the level of the Pokémon that uses the move.
Don't you like Route 11? The double ones in its name are so cool! And guess what! I'm the Coach Trainer on Route "Double One"!
I am a Coach Trainer! Think you can take me on?

I won't hold back! Yaaaah!
You won't battle? OK. Next time.
You're strong! You've got me in a good mood, so take these.
If you use <var> Candy, <var> will get much stronger. If you want to get Candy for a specific Pokémon, try catching that species over and over or send them to the professor!
The Rock Tunnel is a tough place. Why don't you train here before you go?
I'll train you every step of the way, if you want.

OK, kiddo! I'll give you a workout!
Too bad! I'll be waiting for you!
Turns out, you taught me a thing or two! Here, take this. For the lesson.
TM13 can teach your Pokémon Brick Break. This move can break through an opponent's Light Screen or Reflect.
I w-w-want to get to the bottom of this... How did a c-c-coward like me end up in charge of the Pokémon Tower...?
Oh, a b-b-battle? Well, I'm kinda strong...

Here g-g-goes nothing!
Are you quitting...? Are you l-l-leaving...?
That battle took my mind off things a little bit. Here, I found these lying around.
The Candies that make Pokémon stronger... I have a bunch, too! I keep them safe in my Candy Jar...
A small path between towns... Tee-hee. Route 7 is nice, right?
OK. Are you ready?

Now let's play...an ensemble called a battle!
Tee-hee. I get it. Now is not the time.
Thank you for the best battle. Here, take a token of my gratitude.
TM12 has the move Facade. It's a spunky move that deals double damage if the Pokémon using it has a status condition.
Hey! I'm a Coach Trainer! I'm on loan to the Fighting Dojo!
I'm a pretty strong Trainer! Want to have a battle?

Let's have a serious battle! Hiyah!
Acknowledging the difference in power is also a strength!
That was a great match! I want you to have this!
TM23 contains Thunder Punch! Smash your opponents with a fist wreathed in electricity!
Training on a romantic bridge, where you can smell the sea breeze, doubles the effects of the training.
Let's do some coaching! Are you ready?

Let a Pokémon battle begin, yo!
Not interested? Oh, what a shame...
Such a romantic battle! ...Here, a token of my gratitude.
TM59 holds the move Dream Eater. It only works on Pokémon that are asleep, but... I assure you, its effect is devastating.
Pokémon Road is soothing, isn't it?
...Huh? Oh, sorry. I spaced out. I'm a Coach Trainer. Did you want to have a battle?

OK! I'm ready.
You won't battle... That's OK. Take it easy.
It was fun. I think you'll be able to put this to good use.
TM58 is for Drill Run. It's this drilly move that has a higher chance of scoring a critical hit.
The Trainers around here are all very strong! That's right. I've trained every single one of them.
I assume you want to get strong. Shall I be your battle opponent?

Here I come!
I see... That's too bad.
I see the flame of potential in you! Let me give you a TM worthy of your skill.
You can use TM31 to teach your Pokémon the move Fire Punch. It can even give an opponent a burn if you're lucky!
Hey, you! Are you going to Cinnabar Island, by any chance?
I'm bored. Is it OK if I coach you a bit?

My Pokémon will be super serious!
Seriously? My sorrow is deep...
You're pretty good! I'm gonna give you a little present!
TM35 has that move Ice Punch! It's, like, super effective against Dragon-type and Grass-type Pokémon.
Are you surprised to find a Coach Trainer at a place like this? But what is more surprising is that I come here every single day...
There is nothing else to do but battle here. Do you want to battle?

Of course you'll battle me. OK! Here I come.
What's the point of me being here?
Well, you came all the way here... Let me give you something really special.
Don't you feel happy when you have a whole bunch of different Candies in your Candy Jar?
The abandoned Power Plant is the second least desired place for Coach Trainers to be assigned to.
No matter where I am, I'm gonna do my job!

I love my job! Here I come!
Oh? You need time to prepare?
If I did a great job for you, I'm more than happy. Here's a little something extra, too.
You've got to admit, Rare Candies really get the job done!
Oh dear. I thought you were a Burglar, but you're a kid Trainer!
Well? Do you want to have some fun with a Coach Trainer?

OK. Let's have a Pokémon battle!
Not interested?
Battling with you is so much fun! Here's a present, just for you.
TM22 contains the move Rock Slide! It's really impressive, you know? It's such a downpour of rocks! If you're in a Double Battle, you can hit two opponents at once!
I seek a battle...
You... Do you seek a battle?

En garde!
I see...
That was delightful. Allow me to demonstrate my thanks.
I would relish a rematch, should we have the opportunity.
Wow! Your Pokémon isare so cute!
I'm a Coach Trainer! Come on, battle me!

I'm super excited! It'll be a spectacle!
What? That's too bad. Let's do it next time. Promise me!
Ahaha! That was fun! Here, this'll come in handy!
TM39 can be used to teach your Pokémon the move Outrage. You know what they say about cheerful folks like me—you don't want to get us angry!
Hey, Champion! You're allowed to enter this cave! From now on, I'll face you as a Coach Trainer!
Are you ready? Then let's battle!

Are you ready, Champion?!
If you change your mind, battle me.
What a great battle! That's what I expected from a Champion! I didn't stand a chance... Please, accept this from me.
I hear the Pokémon in the Cerulean Cave are terrifyingly strong... Of course, I'm just a guard, so I don't know for sure.
I'm Morimoto. I'm helping out the Coach Trainers. I've got my own reasons.
Do you really want to battle me, the strongest Coach Trainer?

Here I go!
I see. OK, next time.
You're strong. I'll give you this.
I hope you catch a bunch of Pokémon and love each and every one of them!
Oh, you're a new Trainer.
I'm a Coach Trainer. Coach Trainers are the ones who stand in various places to train Trainers. I'm one of them.


We Coach Trainers are strong, if I do say so myself!
If you want to try out your strength, you should definitely battle us.
