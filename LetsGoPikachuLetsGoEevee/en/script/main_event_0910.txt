ARCHER: Youâ€”!
GRUNT: What is it, Mr. Archer? You know that kid?
<var>: Huh? <var>? You know that old guy?


ARCHER: So you're fool enough to get in our way, is that it? What brave little boyschildren.
<var>: ...Wait, aren't they the ones who are getting in our way?
GRUNT: Not even! Mr. Archer's saying you're in his way, all right?! You want to go home in tears or what?
ARCHER: Calm yourself! I'll teach these children a good lesson.


ARCHER: So it wasn't just a stroke of luck that let you beat me last time... I understand now. We'll have to be more careful about you two.
GRUNT: Outta the way!
<var>: Ow!
Hey, look! That Grunt dropped something!
You took the Card Key from <var>!
<var>: We'll just borrow this until all Silph is free!
