<var>: Hey, <var>! Over here!
You see those stairs there? The captain's quarters are up there. He can teach you this cool Secret Technique if you ask him. He's really famous for it!
Though...he looked pretty done in by seasickness when I saw him.
Hey, before you go to meet him, how about I take a look to see how well you've been raising your Pok√©mon, huh?

<var>: Wow, <var>. You... You've gotten pretty strong.
Oh, uh, nothing! That's cool! Anyway, go meet the captain and have him show you his Secret Technique!
