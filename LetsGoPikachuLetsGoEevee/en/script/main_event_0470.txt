ASSISTANT: So you came! Then let's get down to brass tacks. I've got something good to show you.
Believe it or not, I have mastered the Secret Technique Light Up!
Now, let me turn off the lights, and...
There, nice and dark! Now, if you calm your heart... and breathe deeply...you will be able to sense your surroundings, no matter how dark it is!
See? It seems bright, even with the lights off. My keen focus spreads to those around me, you see. Here, I can teach you how to do it, too!
Pika chu!
Veeee!
ASSISTANT: ...Huh? It seems <var> wants to learn it instead, <var>.
What?! And you say it already knows the Secret Technique Chop Down?
I see! Professor Oak had mentioned it, but it really does seem that your <var> is special!
Fascinating! Let me try to teach it! Here, let me turn off the lights again.
Now, <var>! Follow what I do. Calm your heart... breathe deeply and... sense...your surroundings!
<var> learned the Secret Technique Light Up!
Your <var>—it really is quite wonderful!
Now, use Secret Techniques to your heart's content! Since they're not moves, you can use them even if your Pokémon doesn't have the energy to battle!
