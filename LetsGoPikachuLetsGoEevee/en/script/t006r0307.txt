You there, mon petita petite! We're busy here! Out of the way! Shoo! Shoo!
Have you ever wondered about these silver domes we put on top of the food? They're called cloches! They keep hot dishes from cooling.
I'm so busy, I'm getting dizzy! You have to give me room here!
Hum-de-hum-de-ho... I peel spuds every day! Hum-hum...
Have you heard about Snorlax? It's a real glutton. No other Pok√©mon eats and sleeps the way Snorlax can!
*snivel...sniff* I only get to peel onions... *snivel*
Er-hem! Indeed I am le chef! Le main course today is...
my flavorful Whirlpool sushi! Though les guests may complain that it's fish yet again...
le Kantonian flavor of Pewter Crunchies! Les guests will mutiny, I fear.
my juicy Take Down steak! But have I enough pour les guests?
