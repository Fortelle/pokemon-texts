Oh dear, what am I supposed to do with you, Slowpoke?
Oh, hello there. Do you think you could do me a favor?
Oh, of course, you must be busy. Sorry to have bothered you.
I want to go to the Pewter museum, but my dear Slowpoke here is just refusing to budge!
SLOWPOKE: Poooooke...
Do you think you could keep an eye on my dear Slowpoke for a little while?
Why, hello! Do you think you could keep an eye on Slowpoke again?
Sure!
Sorry, but...
Oh, thank you very much! In that case, please keep my dear Slowpoke company for a little while.
... ... ... ... ... ...
Slowpoke is staring blankly ahead...
Slowpoke seems very good at doing nothing...
Slowpoke is just contentedly sitting there...
Slowpoke looks like it's thinking about something...
Slowpoke seems to have only just noticed you...
Slowpoke is looking at you from the corner of its eye...
Slowpoke seems just a little wary of you...
Slowpoke seems to be getting used to you...
Slowpoke seems a little happy...
Slowpoke seems like it's happy to spend time with you!
You spent a relaxing time with Slowpoke!
Thank you for keeping an eye on dear Slowpoke! Here, this is for your trouble.
You got a <var> from the lady!
I would love it if you could keep an eye on Slowpoke again sometime.
