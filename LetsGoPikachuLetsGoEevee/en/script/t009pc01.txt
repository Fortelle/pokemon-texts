I came to visit the Cinnabar Island Gym, but the door is locked tight. There must be a key somewhere, though. Maybe in that old mansion? They say that one of the Gym Leader's friends used to live there...
Do you have lots of friends? People say Pokémon you get by trading with a friend grow faster. I think it would be worth your time to give trading a try.
Pokémon can keep on learning new moves, even if you stop them from evolving. It's a trick that experienced Trainers know! Wait till your Pokémon learns a move it wouldn't otherwise, and only then do you evolve it!
There's a flyer titled "Pokémon Center News."
Will you read it?
"The volcano on Cinnabar Island has been more active than usual lately. "If there should be a big eruption, please leave the island immediately! "The Pokémon Center will keep its doors open to the public for as long as we are able, and we welcome your visit...but please brush off any volcanic ash at the door."
