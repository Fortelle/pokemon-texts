I need to go use the restroom, but here comes another guest! The new guy who's supposed to take over my shift is running late! Hereâ€”take this thing. If I have to skedaddle, maybe it can inspire you to cover for me!

TM03 is Helping Hand! Helping Hand will boost the power of an ally's attacks during a battle.
Are you using Helping Hand? I still need a little help myself...
