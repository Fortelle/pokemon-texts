The screen says something about a teleporter.
Whoa, I should get in there! Don't mess this up, OK?
You started up the Cell Separation System on the teleporter.
BILL: Yee-haw! Thanks, bud! I owe you one! ...Hey, you've got your Pokémon Box right there in your Bag! Good job!
BILL: Yee-haw! Thanks, lady! I owe you one! ...Hey, you've got your Pokémon Box right there in your Bag! Good job!
If you ever catch too many Pokémon and your Box gets full, send some of those Pokémon to Professor Oak! I bet he'd be mighty thankful!


Oh! Look at me—I'd forget my own head if it weren't attached... I should do something to thank you, too! You did save me, after all. Here! Maybe this'll do.
You got some S.S. Tickets from Bill!

That cruise ship, the S.S. Anne, pulls into port in Vermilion City. They invited me to some party on board, but I can't stand fancy gatherings. Why don't you go instead of me? There are a couple of tickets in there, so have some fun with a friend or something!
BILL: If you catch too many Pokémon and your Box is just bursting full of 'em, send a whole bunch to the professor at once! He'll love it!
