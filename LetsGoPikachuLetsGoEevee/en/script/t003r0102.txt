This month, we're running a space exhibit.
Moon Stone, huh? What's so special about it? Looks like an ordinary rock to me.
It has been decades since mankind stood on the moon...and now, we're following the dream of standing on that faraway red planet! News about space always makes me so excited!
I want <var>! It's so cute! Daddy, can you please get one for me?
Yeah, I'll get you <var> soonâ€” I promise!
I think you and <var> are going to become fast friends. I couldn't take that away...
Hey, your <var>... No, it's too attached to you. I could never tear apart such a bond.
It looks like an old space shuttle.
It says it's an object that fell on Mt. Moon, thought to be a Moon Stone.
A 3-D hologram! And it has a title: A Map of the Universe.
They look to be pieces of a meteor.
It seems to show the origin of the universe.
"This way"
You saw a beautiful crystal when you looked into the microscope.
