JESSIE: We'd heard there were loads of rare Pokémon in that GO Park place, so we came to check it out for ourselves...
JAMES: But it was so complicated. App this and connectivity that... It was so creepy, we had to get out of there.
MEOWTH: Mrowr...

JESSIE: Why can't I just trip over a get-rich-quick scheme already?
Hm? Feels like I just kicked something really hard.
JAMES: Could it be some kind of treasure? At last, our big score! Let's see what it is!
JESSIE & JAMES: Heave-ho!


JESSIE: Wow! Just look at that shine! This must be some amazing treasure!
...As if! Yuck! What are these? Some kind of Gold Teeth?
JAMES: T-teeth? No matter how gold they are, some things just aren't worth the effort...

JESSIE: Ah, it's the twerp! What're you doing here? Never mind that—take these off our hands!
You had a pair of Gold Teeth thrust upon you!
JAMES: We're busy, so you take care of whatever those are for us!
JESSIE: That's right! Now's the time for our fantastic getaway!
