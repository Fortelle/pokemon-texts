You gave the Gold Teeth to the warden.
The warden popped in his teeth!
WARDEN: Yuck! They're all sandy and gritty! ...Anyway. Thanks, sonny! You're a real lifesaver! No one could understand a word that I said— not a one! I was too ashamed to show my face around the office, even. Let me give you something for your trouble.

You got a Safari Set from the warden!
You put the Safari Set in your Clothing Trunk!
And here... I'll teach you something neat! A Secret Technique called Strong Push!
What's this, sonny? You'd rather have your Pokémon learn the Secret Technique?
Well I suppose it makes no difference to me! Now come this way and have a look.

You sometimes find big blocks like this one in caves and other such places, right? You can push them around if you take a moment to gather up your strength first!
The trick is this... Hrrrkh! You grit your teeth as hard as you can! ...If you've got 'em... Then all at once, just let 'er rip!
Hyah!

Hooey! Look at that, learning Strong Push in just one go! Your <var> is a clever one, sonny!
