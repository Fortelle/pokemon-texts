<var>: Hey. Nice! I was hoping we'd run into each other!
You know there's a Pok√©mon Gym up this way, right, <var>? You can battle against the Gym Leader there, and he's seriously strong!
If you want to get stronger, you've definitely gotta try to take him on!
<var>: Hah! Jeez, <var>! You're ready for a good battle, too, huh? Who wouldn't be! All right, then. You're making me want to cheer you guys on, too, so take these!
You got 5 Potions from <var>!
I bought some for you with the prize money I've been earning in all my battles. Beat that Gym Leader, <var>, and you can really call yourself a true Trainer! Give it your best!
