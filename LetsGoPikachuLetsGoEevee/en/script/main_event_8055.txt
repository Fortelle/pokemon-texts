Yo! Champ in the making! We have the Safari Zone here in Fuchsia City, where you can meet tons of different Pokémon! And at the Fuchsia City Gym, we welcome Trainers who've met lots of Pokémon, so...
I'll need to see if you've managed to catch at least 50 species of Pokémon! ...
Well done! Looks like you've caught <var> species! That means you are now worthy of challenging my Gym! ...
Fwahahahaha! Startled by my disguise, are you? I shall use my intricate style to confound and destroy you in battle, as well!
I'm amazed every time I see that... He looked just like me, right? Now, head on in! Experience his moves for yourself!
You've caught... <var> species! Unfortunately, you haven't made it to 50 species yet... Go catch some more Pokémon and then come back! The Fuchsia City Gym is always open!
