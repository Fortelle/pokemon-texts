Oh! <var>! You've gotta—! You're not gonna believe this! A P-P-Pokémon... It...it... Gahhh!

<var>: Hah... Deep breaths... OK. Let me try that again... Sorry, it's not like me to lose my cool like that...
There's a house up ahead where this famous Pokémon fanatic is supposed to live... I wanted to stop by, because I thought maybe I'd get to see some rare Pokémon or something.
But what I found... and don't freak out when you hear this...
That Pokémon fanatic Bill wasn't there... Instead there was a Pokémon...that TALKED!
Eeesh, just thinking about it gives me the creeps! Don't go in there, <var>!
