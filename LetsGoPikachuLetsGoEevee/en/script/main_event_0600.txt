BROCK: Hey! I didn't expect to run into you here.
I'm on my way back from visiting the Celadon City Gym. Keeping in touch with other Gym Leaders is part of our duties, after all!
The girls at that Gym all turned me away for some reason, though...
Actually, have some Pewter Crunchies! I'd brought them as a gift to the Gym here.
You got Pewter Crunchies from Brock!
Oh, and you're probably going to want some tea after eating them. Pewter Crunchies can make you thirsty.
You got a cup of Tea from Brock!
Ah! I don't have enough left to give to that thirsty guard now...
Anyway, it looks like you've been visiting the Gyms in other cities! I wish you the best!
