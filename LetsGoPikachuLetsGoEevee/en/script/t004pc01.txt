Oooh, that Bill! I heard that he'll do anything to get his hands on rare Pokémon. Anything at all!
Have you heard about Bill? Everyone calls him a Pokémon fanatic! But with a collection like his, who wouldn't want to brag a little bit? I think people are just jealous!
There are two types of attacking moves: physical moves and special moves. If your Pokémon's Attack stat is high, teach it physical moves.
Why don't you trade Pokémon with your friends? You could get a lot more variety by trading. The Pokémon you get in trades grow quickly, too.
There's a book called Pokémon Journal: Interviews.
Will you read it?
"Future Activities of Pokémon Fanatic Bill "'Well, I'm researching about how to become a Pokémon! "'...It's just a joke! Don't take it seriously! "'Actually, I'm doing research on understanding the minds of Pokémon. "'I want to understand what they are thinking!'"
