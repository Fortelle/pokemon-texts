Hi! Remember me? I'm one of Professor Oak's assistants. The professor told me that if your Pokédex has good data on 30 species of Pokémon, I'm to give you the Judge function. So, <var>, let me ask you... Have you gathered data on at least 30 species of Pokémon?
Great! You have caught <var> species of Pokémon! Congratulations! Now, let me update your Pokémon Box!
Your Pokémon Box gained the Judge function!
View a Pokémon's summary via your Pokémon Box, and you'll be able to see their potential.
Let's see... Uh-oh! You've only caught <var> different species of Pokémon! You've got to reach 30 species if you want the Judge function.
...Oh, I see. When you get 30 species of Pokémon, come back for the Judge function.
