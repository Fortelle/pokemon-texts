Shh! I'm a beautiful spy...on an undercover mission...
...What's a child like you doing here?
I'm here to beat Team Rocket
I'm just here for fun
Heh... You've got attitude! I like that!
Hee hee! You're an interesting child, that's for sure.
Let me give you a present so you remember our little encounter here!
You got a Team Rocket Set from the beautiful spy!
You put the Team Rocket Set in your Clothing Trunk!
Just wear that set, and you'll feel as if you're a Team Rocket Grunt yourself!
...Although you're too short to be a real Grunt. They'd figure out you were in a disguise immediately.
Now, don't go telling everyone I'm a spy, OK? If you do, I'll have to give you a scolding!
