BROCK: ...You sure look different from when we first met! I have a request for you, since you're now the Pokémon League Champion. The truth is, Gym Leaders have the right to challenge the Champion! ...Please allow me the privilege of facing you in battle once again! Allow me to show you the true rock-hard strength of my Pokémon!
BROCK: No matter what kind of opponent you may be, my Rock-type Pokémon will take you on! That's the promise of my rock-hard will!
BROCK: I've chosen to postpone my dream of becoming a Pokémon Breeder just for a little bit longer. Right now I'm more interested in training to grow strong enough to one day face and defeat you! Please, battle me every day so I can grow even stronger!
