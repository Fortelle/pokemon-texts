We nicknamed the warden "Slowpoke." 'Cause, you know, he has that vacant look like a Slowpoke.
Warden Slowpoke is very knowledgeable about Pokémon. He even has some Fossils of Pokémon I've never seen.
Ever since Warden Slowpoke went fishing the other day, it's been hard to understand him. All he does is mumble and moan... Maybe his age is finally getting to him?
I thought I caught a glimpse of something gold and shiny out toward Route 19... Maybe it was some kind of buried treasure?!
"This week's goal at the Safari Zone: wake up even earlier than the Pokémon do!"
