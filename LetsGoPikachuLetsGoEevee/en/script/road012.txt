Route 12 (North to Lavender Town)
Fishing Area
Hey, do you know what Catch Combos are? If you keep catching the same species of Pokémon over and over, you'll have a better chance of meeting a really strong one!
Sometimes Pokémon come to sleep on this path and don't wake up for a long time. When that happens, it's recommended that you take the other route around them.
