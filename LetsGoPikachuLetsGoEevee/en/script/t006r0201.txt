Aim for the center when the ring is small... I hear that's the trick when throwing Poké Balls!
When the ring's color is green, it means that Pokémon is easy to catch, right? And when it's yellow, it's a bit harder. But when it's red, it becomes super hard!
I fed a Nanab Berry to a wild Pokémon, and it seemed to calm the Pokémon down! It stopped jumping around, so I was able to aim with my Poké Balls easily!
You know, you have a better chance of catching a Pokémon with a Great Ball than with a Poké Ball. Even then, it's not a guaranteed catch, of course.
