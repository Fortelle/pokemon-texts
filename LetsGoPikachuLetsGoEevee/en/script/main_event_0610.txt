I'm on guard duty. And I take my duty very seriously. But, gee, am I ever thirsty! I wish I had some tea to drink...
Oh, hold on there, kid. I'm afraid I can't let you pass through here.
Oh, that tea you have... It looks awfully tasty...
What? I can have a drink? Gee, thanks!
*glug glug glug* *glug glug glug* Well... *glug glug* If you really wanna go to Saffron City... *glug* I guess I can let you past... *glug glug* *gulp*
I'll share this tea with the guards working the other gates around the city, too.
Oh, you're that kid... Thanks again for before!
Oh dear, I think I gave that poor guard too many Pewter Crunchies to eat... They're rather dry if you don't have any tea or anything to wash them down...
There really is nothing like a hot cup of tea to go with your Pewter Crunchies!
