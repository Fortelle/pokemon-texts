GIOVANNI: Now, now, Mr. President. I hope you're not thinking of lying to me.
The Master Ball... You successfully created one, didn't you!
PRESIDENT: Do you think it's that easy to make?
And now that I know who you really are, there is no way I want to make a thing like that... Not for someone like you!
GIOVANNI: How dare you?!
PRESIDENT: And give up any thought of forcing us to create lots of powerful Pokémon for you!
Using stolen research to create Pokémon... That's not something Silph should ever do.
GIOVANNI: We had a deal! You agreed to this!
...You're a smart man. I'm sure you can imagine what will happen to your people if you say no to me now.
PRESIDENT: ...
GIOVANNI: Ah. Young <var>. So we meet again! The president of Silph and I are discussing a vital business proposition. Keep your nose out of grown-up matters...
Or experience a world of pain!

GIOVANNI: Blast... I have little choice, it seems. I will relinquish Silph for now.
But Team Rocket will never fall!
<var>! Never forget...
All Pokémon exist for Team Rocket's use!
I may leave you now, but we will meet again!
