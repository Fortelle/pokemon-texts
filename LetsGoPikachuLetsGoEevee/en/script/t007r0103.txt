Me? I'm a programmer!
Did you complete your Pokédex?! Great! It was worth programming it!
I'm a graphic artist! I'm the one who designed you!
Congratulations on completing your Pokédex! You really look like you've grown and matured! Actually your model hasn't changed at all, has it? ...Er, never mind! Don't mind me!
I wrote the story! Hey, tell me... Don't you think Erika is cute? I like Misty a lot, too! Oh, and Sabrina! I like her, too!
You completed your Pokédex? Impressive! But you still have a long way to go... Just kidding!
It's the game code! Messing with it could bug out the game!
Someone's playing a game instead of working!
It's the script! Better not look at the ending!
