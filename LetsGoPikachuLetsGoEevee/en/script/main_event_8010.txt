MISTY: Hi! You're a new face!
What's your policy on Pokémon? What's your approach?
My policy for battle is... an all-out offensive with Water-type Pokémon!
Misty, the world-famous beauty, is your host!
My sweet Pokémon are ready! Are you?


MISTY: All right, you can have a Cascade Badge to show that you beat me.
You got a Cascade Badge from Misty!
MISTY: A Cascade Badge makes Pokémon up to Lv. 30 from other Trainers listen to you. And you can also have my favorite TM!
You got <var> <var> from Misty!
MISTY: TM29 teaches Pokémon the move Scald. Use it on a Pokémon that lives in the water!
