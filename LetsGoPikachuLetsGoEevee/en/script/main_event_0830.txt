MR. FUJI: So, <var>... Your Pokédex quest is one that requires strong dedication. Without deep love for Pokémon, it will be hard to complete such a task. I'm not sure if this will help you, but I'd like you to have it.
You got the Poké Flute from Mr. Fuji!
Upon hearing the Poké Flute, sleeping Pokémon will spring awake. Try using it if you ever find a sleeping Pokémon.

MR. FUJI: Has my Poké Flute helped you?
