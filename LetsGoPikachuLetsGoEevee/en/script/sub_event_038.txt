I'm not good at raising Pokémon. I feel sorry for my Charmander because it's not getting stronger. So I want to give it to a better Trainer than me. Are you interested?
The number of Pokémon you've caught is <var>!
Cool! I want you to have this Charmander. Will you take it?
Take good care of my Charmander!
I've caught <var> Pokémon. You should catch more than that!
Oh... I'd better send it to the professor, then.
How's Charmander doing?
CHARMANDER: Chaaar!
