???: Hey, you there! Newbie!
???: Don't tell me... You've gotta be <var>, right?
I am! That's amazing!
How did you know that?!
Ha, I knew it! I'm always right.
'Cause you look just like my gramps said.
BLUE: I'm Blue! I heard from my gramps that two new kids set out from Pallet Town to become Trainers, just like I did once. So I came to check you out!
I was thinking you might want some advice on how to beat the Gym from an expert Trainer like me, but looks like I showed up too late, huh?
Seems you're not too shabby yourself... So I guess you've earned a reward, newbie!



You got 5 Great Balls from Blue!
BLUE: Those'll be even better for catching Pokémon than plain old Poké Balls. And hey, that thing you've got there... That's a Pokédex, right? So Gramps finally went and made one!
He used to make me just scribble on a map with a pencil about where I encountered Pokémon...
You'd better do a good job helping him out! He may be Professor Oak to you, and sure, he's an old coot, but he's still my gramps! Smell ya later, newbie!
