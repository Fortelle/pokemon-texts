RECEPTIONIST: You there!
I have to tell you that our office is a bit of a disaster right now... A REAL disaster! This is no place for kids—not when there are so many dangerous people around!
BLUE: Aw, don't be such a stick in the mud. You won't even let us have a little look around?
RECEPTIONIST: Oh! Y...you're Blue! THE Blue!
<var>: <var>! I've been looking for you!
What're you doing in a place like this?
Well, Team Rocket...
I heard there was a take-over...
<var>: No surprise! Those Team Rocket goons are causing trouble all over the place!
BLUE: You and me are on the same wavelength, <var>. We can't keep letting Team Rocket do whatever they please!
That's right!
What do we do?
BLUE: Come on! It's time we did a little strategy planning!
BLUE: We do whatever we can do!
BLUE: ...So in short, the plan is this: <var> is gonna drive Team Rocket out of Silph Co., just like she planned. But it'd be crazy to try something like that alone, so <var> is going with himer.
<var>: Right!
BLUE: While you pip-squeaks do that, I'm gonna do a loop around all of Kanto, squashing out Team Rocket wherever I find 'em! One of us is sure to find out where their boss is hiding.
And while I'm at it, I'll swing by the Pokémon League to tell the bigwigs there what's going on.
<var>: Awesome! Do you think the Elite Four might come help us?!
BLUE: Maybe! So that's the battle plan, guys and gal! Time to split up and put it into action!
...Heh. If only it were that simple. Fact is, there's one more thing we've gotta do here first.
<var>! <var>! If you want me to leave this place up to you two newbies, then prove that you're up to the task!
<var>: What?!
BLUE: I don't care who goes first, so show me what you've got!
BLUE: Hey now! You lost or something? I'm standing right here!
RECEPTIONIST: Have you come to save Silph Co. from those criminals? If you're friends with a famous Trainer like Blue, then I'm sure we can rely on you.
<var>: If I can beat Blue, then I can go get revenge for Marowak... That's right! I think maybe I can really do this! <var>, you wanna go first?
