Hello there! I've been watching you walk right past me this whole time, and I was hoping you'd come to visit me someday. I was really lonely... Why did I make a pond right in front of my house...?
Just going for a walk is troublesome. I was so shortsighted when I was young. I was so stupid, stupid, stupid!
I was such an idiot!
...Phew! Sorry for my toxic venting, but I feel better now. So I'll give you a TM!
TM26 contains Poison Jab, a scary toxic move! It's more toxic than my venting. It stabs the opponent with a poisonous arm and may poison the opponent!
