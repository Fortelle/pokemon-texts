Ten-hut! Welcome to the Vermilion City Gym!
Will you look at that—a pint-sized challenger!
Hahaha! You've got big and brassy nerves to take me on with your puny power!
A Pokémon battle is war! I'll show you, civilian!
I'll shock you into surrender!

Fine! Then take a Thunder Badge!
You got a Thunder Badge from Lt. Surge!
And that's not all! You're special, kid! Take this!
You got Lt. Surge's Autograph.
... ... ...
Dahaha! Don't worry! That's not all I'm giving you!
You got <var> <var> from Lt. Surge!
TM36 contains the electrifying Thunderbolt! Teach it to an Electric-type Pokémon for some extra shock value!
And a little word of advice, kid! Electric-type moves are sure powerful! But remember that they'll get sucked right up by Ground-type Pokémon! Those moves are useless against them!
