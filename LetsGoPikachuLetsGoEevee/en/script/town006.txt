Vermilion City: The Port of Exquisite Sunsets
There's a notice posted by the Vermilion Police... "A sleeping Pokémon has been blocking the way on Route 12 lately. Detour through the Rock Tunnel if you need to reach Lavender Town."
Pokémon Fan Club: All Pokémon Fans Welcome!
Vermilion City Pokémon Gym Gym Leader: Lt. Surge The Lightning Lieutenant!
Vermilion Port
I get so sweaty after doing sports that I end up feeling all grimy! Speaking of which...you know Grimer? It's born from ocean sludge. Not sweat, I guess.
Did you see it? The S.S. Anne is in the harbor right now!
So the S.S. Anne has departed? I guess she'll be back in Vermilion Port about this time next year...
This is my land. All of it. I own eeeeverything in this square area here! I'm having my Pokémon use Bulldoze to prepare the site so I can build something here!
MACHOP: Guoh! Gogogoh!
A Machop is stomping the land flat.
If you're new to training Pokémon, you should give my place a little visit. It's an empty house, but I've rented it so people can use it as a place to gather and share tips!
Some Pokémon don't just want to walk with you. Some would rather give their Trainer a ride! I bet it would be pretty great to take a ride with a Pokémon that could swim across the water or fly through the air...
MAGIKARP: Karp karp karp!

This thing here isn't for resting your feet on, you know. It's for tying up your boat!
