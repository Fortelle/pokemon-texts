The president is still in the boardroom on the 11th floor! I'm so worried. I hope he's safe...
Thank you for rescuing the president! I couldn't thank you enough!
Team Rocket must be after the Master Ball, a Poké Ball that's guaranteed to catch any Pokémon! I bet they're going to make us make lots of Master Balls for them to use...
We canceled the Master Ball project because of Team Rocket.
It'll be bad if Team Rocket gets complete control of Silph and our Pokémon...
Wow! You chased off Team Rocket?
You! It's really dangerous here! You came to save me? You can't!
Thank you so much!
