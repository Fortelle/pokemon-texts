<var>: Oh! Hey, <var>!
Seems like we can't pass through the gate there.
But the Underground Path should take us to Vermilion City. It's a bit dark and spooky, though...
Huh?
Hold still for one sec, <var>...
I was wondering what the sparkly thing was. This was stuck in your hair!
You got a Revive from <var>!
Revives can heal Pokémon that have been knocked out in battle. I have a few extra, so... Here, take some of mine, too!
You got 2 Revives from <var>!
Maybe those will help you when you take on the next Gym!
...Huh? Are those S.S. Tickets you have?
Here, take one!
I've got one extra, so...
No way! They're for the S.S. Anne, right? I hear it's a luxury cruise liner that's traveled all over the world! Man, I'd love a chance to see what it's like on the inside, even just once...
... ...
You gave <var> one of your S.S. Tickets.
Hey, are you sure I can have this? You know I'm definitely going, right? Where'd you get this, anyway?
...Eek! You got it from that talking Pokémon?!
What? Oh, it was a person after all? Well, I guess that's good to hear...
Hey, just, uh, forget about that whole thing, OK?
I think I'll press on ahead! See you there!
