I'm getting my Pidgey to fly a letter to Saffron City in the north.
PIDGEY: Krrrkoo!
"Dear Pippi, I hope I can go see you soon. I've heard that Saffron City is having lots of trouble with Team Rocket. Vermilion City seems safe for now..."
Gee, I wish I could take a trip aboard the S.S. Anne someday! I could make new friends all over the world!
NIDORANâ™€: Dooo!
