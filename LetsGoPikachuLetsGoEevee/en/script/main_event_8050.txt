KOGA: Fwahahaha!
A mere child like you dares to challenge me? The very idea makes me shiver with mirth! Very well, I shall show you true terror as a ninja master!
Opponents can't lay a hand on me, as poison brings their steady doom.
Despair as you feel the creeping horror of Poison-type Pokémon!

Here! Take a Soul Badge!
You got a Soul Badge from Koga!
Now that you have a Soul Badge, Pokémon up to Lv. <var> will heed your command if you received them in a trade. Ah! Take this, too.
You got <var> <var> from Koga!
Sealed within that TM27 lies the move Toxic! It is an ancient move, passed down through my family for 400 years.
When hit with Toxic's poisonous effects, a Pokémon will take more and more damage with each turn that passes in battle! It will surely terrorize your opponent!
