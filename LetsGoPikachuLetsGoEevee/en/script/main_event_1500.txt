<var>: Aw man! My reign is over already? That was pretty short!
You're the Champion now, <var>! And as for me... I've got a new goal to work toward!
OAK: <var>!
So, you've done it at last! You've defeated the Pokémon League! My sincerest congratulations!
You've grown a great deal since you first caught <var> and set out with that Pokédex.
Yes, <var>, you've really come into your own as a fine young woman!
And <var>! You showed great resolve, never losing heart as you saw your journey through to the end!
I did see, though, in the way that you do battle... That kind heart of yours might still be causing you to hold yourself back when it comes to your Pokémon and to facing <var>. It's hardly much of a weakness, but it may have cost you the battle this time.
Regardless, the two of you showed us an extraordinary battle!
<var>: Th-thanks, Professor!
OAK: <var>. You understand that your victory was not just your own doing, don't you? It was the marvelous bond you share with your Pokémon that brought you here. Now, <var>! Come with me!
<var>: Man, you truly are something! But that doesn't mean I'm giving up! I'll keep taking on the challenge to be the Champion as many times as it takes!
OAK: <var>!
Congratulations on another victory over the Pokémon League! Defending your seat as Champion is certainly no easy feat. Such an effort should be celebrated! Follow me!
