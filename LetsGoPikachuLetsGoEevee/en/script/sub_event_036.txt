Hi! Remember me? I'm one of Professor Oak's assistants. The professor told me that if your Pokédex has good data on 40 species of Pokémon, I'm to give you this special Ball Set U. So, <var>, let me ask you... Have you gathered data on at least 40 species of Pokémon?
Great! You have caught <var> species of Pokémon! Congratulations! Then here you go!
You got 30 Ultra Balls from the assistant!
It's very easy to catch Pokémon with an Ultra Ball. As for a Poké Ball that makes it even easier to catch Pokémon than an Ultra Ball... Well, I hear Silph Co. may or may not be working on just such a thing.
Let's see... Uh-oh! You've only caught <var> different species of Pokémon! You've got to reach 40 species if you want this Ball Set U from me.

...Oh, I see. When you get 40 species of Pokémon, come back for the Ball Set U.
