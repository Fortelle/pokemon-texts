Just how long are you gonna follow us around? I know I'm beautiful, but what do you want?
To rescue Cubone
To join Team Rocket
JESSIE: What?! That Cubone? Ha! We already gave the poor thing to the boss!
JESSIE: What? Really?! You certainly do show potential. Though you're not nearly as beautiful as me... Wait a minute—you're trying to trick me!
JESSIE: It doesn't matter! There's no way we're letting you through to see the boss!
JAMES: It's payback time for those Fossils from Mt. Moon, you brat!


JESSIE: Hmph! How infuriating! Don't let it go to your head just because your Pokémon were a teeny tiny bit stronger!
JAMES: Exactly! And even if you did defeat us in battle, we're still bigger and stronger than you! We'll just use brute force to—
Pikaaa!!!
Veeeeee!!!
JAMES: Eeek!
JESSIE & JAMES: Looks like Team Rocket's blasting off again!





JESSIE: Hey, twerp, you can't battle the both of us with just one Pokémon! You'd better go get another and come back to take us on!
