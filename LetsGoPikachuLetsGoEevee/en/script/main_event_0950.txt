PRESIDENT: Oh, dear boy! Thank you for saving us here at Silph!
PRESIDENT: Oh, dear girl! Thank you for saving us here at Silph!
Pika pika!
Vee vee!
Wahaha! I suppose that's so. It wasn't just you— it was that wonderful partner of yours, too!
I will never forget how you saved us in our moment of peril.
I have to thank you in some way. And I'm quite magnanimous, so I can give you anything. Here, maybe this will do?
You got the Master Ball from the president!
PRESIDENT: You can't buy that anywhere. It's our secret prototype, the Master Ball.
It will catch any Pokémon without fail! Truthfully, we've only succeeded in making just the one.
So you should probably be quiet about using it.
PRESIDENT: Ah! Our saviors! Thank you again for saving Silph Co. for us!
PRESIDENT: Oh! Wait for a moment! Please let me reward you!

SECRETARY: Thank you for rescuing all of us. We, from the president on down, are indebted to you for what you did.
SECRETARY: A Poké Ball that can catch any Pokémon without fail... It's not something to be given to just any ordinary Trainer. That's why the president entrusted it to you.
