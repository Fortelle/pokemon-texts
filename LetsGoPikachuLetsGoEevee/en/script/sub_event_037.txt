I'm taking care of injured Pokémon here.
Bulbasaur is fully recovered, so I'd like to give this Pokémon to a Trainer who's caught a lot of Pokémon and I can trust.
The number of Pokémon you've caught so far is <var>?!
Incredible! Would you take care of this Bulbasaur?
Please take care of Bulbasaur!
Ah... If you've caught at least <var> Pokémon, will you come back to get Bulbasaur?
Is Bulbasaur doing well?
Oh... That's too bad...
BULBASAUR: Bubba! Zoar!
