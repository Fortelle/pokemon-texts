<var>: Hey, <var>!
Oh! Wait, don't tell me...
You already caught that superstrong Pokémon, didn't you? I knew it! So, it's called Mewtwo, huh?
Man, you got to Mewtwo before me or that girl!
Huh? Oh, I ran into this gutsy girl who said she was looking for a powerful Pokémon. I think she meant Mewtwo.
Well, I guess that's that... Here, take these. I won't need 'em now!
You got 3 Escape Ropes from <var>!
I just saw that girl come in here, too. She must still be looking for Mewtwo. You should go show it to her!
Ow! You were hit by a low-flying Poké Ball!
???: Oh, whoops! You're not a Pokémon!
Sorry, it's so dark in here, I saw you and thought you were some kind of Pokémon.
GREEN: Well, uh... Nice to meet you. I'm Green!
So, hey, I'm just curious... Are you here because you're also looking for... y'know, something special?
R-right! Mewtwo!
...Drat, so you knew about it already, huh.
... ... ...
Whaaaaaaaaaat?! You've already caught it?!
Hey, no fair! I was planning on catching it first!
Wow, you're strong! Well, I guess that's that. Here, you can have these.
You got a Mewtwonite X and a Mewtwonite Y!
Oh, I know! Why don't you become one of my Pokémon, together with Mewtwo?
A Poké Ball came flying at you!
GREEN: Hee hee hee...
Think about it, OK?
GREEN: Drat, I couldn't catch you this time either, huh...
Well, never mind. Just show me how strong you've gotten!
Wow, I think you're plenty strong already! So, what do you say? Don't you think it's time you become one of my Pokémon? Along with Mewtwo, of course!
I'm not going to give up, you know!
