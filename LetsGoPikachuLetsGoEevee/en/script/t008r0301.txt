If you catch a bunch of the same Pokémon species, the chance of you finding an item after catching them increases! I go for Geodude and Onix, myself. Bahaha!
There are ways you can get special bonuses when you catch a Pokémon! Number one! Time your throw to land when the ring is small! Number two! Catch them with your first throw... And so on! You'll get a lot of good things out of it, such as extra Exp. Points.
If you catch the same Pokémon species over and over, you'll get a Catch Combo. If you can keep it going, I hear you'll be more likely to run into Shiny Pokémon!
You're more likely to find an item after catching a Pokémon if you feed it a Pinap Berry first, right? You've noticed that, too, right?
