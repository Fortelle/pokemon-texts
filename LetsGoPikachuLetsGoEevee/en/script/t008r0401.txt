The Safari Zone's warden may be old, but he's still in great health! Though...his teeth are all false, to be fair.
Hmm? You've met Bill? He's my grandson! He always liked rare things, even as a child!
My big brother Bill's job is transferring Pokémon so people can send Pokémon to one another! He's the one who developed the Box system. Oh, and you know the GO Park complex? He made that, too, with some professor from a faraway region.
