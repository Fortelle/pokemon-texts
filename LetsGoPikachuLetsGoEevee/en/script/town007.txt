Rocket Game Corner: A Playground for Grown-Ups and Kids Alike!
My Koffing is the best partner ever! It spews out Poison Gas when it gets angry... but it's usually very sweet—I promise!
Haha! This Gym is great! It's full of strong Trainers!
Celadon City takes pride in its efforts to keep itself clean and beautiful. The area around the Game Corner is a different story, though. It gets a bit rough around there.
Awww... I lost again at the Game Corner! I guess the people who are so good at the games there must be putting in more effort than I do...
This is my trusted pal, Poliwrath. It evolved from a Poliwhirl when I used a Water Stone on it.
POLIWRATH: Ribi ribit!
What're you staring at? Get lost. Either you leave or I'll make you leave!
What d'you think you're doing running around here?! We're Team Rocket, don't you know!
My Jigglypuff has an Adamant Nature! It's easy to raise its Attack stat but not so easy to raise its Sp. Atk. Its Double Slap is a real slap in the face!
JIGGLYPUFF: Fhun fhun!
KOFFING: Gasss...
It's a strange vehicle with a bunch of balloons attached to it!
All right. Let's go to the restaurant, shall we?
Grandma, I'm hungry!
Oh? Shouldn't I be able to reach the Gym from here?
RATTATA: Gnaw gnaw!
GLOOM: Mehhh...
