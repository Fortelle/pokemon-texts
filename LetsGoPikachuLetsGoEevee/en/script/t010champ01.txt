Yo! Champ in the making! At the Pokémon League, you will face the Elite Four all in a row. If you lose, you have to start all over again! This is it! Go for it!
Hey, I hope you show me an amazing match today, too! I'm looking forward to it!
If you go on ahead, you'll face the Elite Four one by one. If you win, a door opens to the next Trainer. Good luck!
Are you done with your shopping? Is your party all healed up? This is the big challenge, so you want to make sure you're fully prepared!
I can't even beat the first member of the Elite Four... So this is the Pokémon League... The most skilled Trainers...
