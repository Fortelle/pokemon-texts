This Lapras is getting on in age, but it's still a real beauty, wouldn't you say?
We used to ride on waves and travel the whole wide world together!
LAPRAS: Splaaash!
Lapras can't swim like it used to... So we'll stay here together.
Thank you for listening.
As thanks, I'll teach you the Secret Technique Sea Skim. With this technique, you can travel on water!
Haha! Your <var> wants to learn it as well?
I'm not sure if it can learn it. It's not Water type...
Pikapi!
Eeeveee!
You look determined, just like my Lapras!
OK! I'll teach you the technique, then!
Pikapi!
Veee!
...Now, you have to keep balance on the water! Lower the center of gravity, and keep balance with your upper body!
<var> learned the Secret Technique Sea Skim!
You did great! I'll give you that board, too!
Ride waves and travel the whole wide world together!
I hope you and <var> will stay good friends for a long time!
