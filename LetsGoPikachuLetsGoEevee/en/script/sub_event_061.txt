???: Awww... Well, shoot.
I was so caught up sketching the ocean view here that I guess I missed my ship...
That's awful!
What are you going to do?
Hmm... I guess I'll stay here for a while, in that case! I really like the color of the sea in Kanto anyway.
MINA: How about it, Kantonian Trainer? Want to try battling my Fairy-type Pokémon?
All right. Why don't we gaze out at the sea together, then?
Heh heh heh... Then here I go! You're going to learn how great Fairy-type Pokémon can be!
MINA: Oh! Wonderful! You and your Pokémon, battling side by side... Now that's a great composition! I'd love to draw a picture of you two.
MINA: I can't go back to Alola until I defeat you. Heh. Just kidding. But let's battle again sometime.
