The game in which Pokémon fly in the sky... It's great, isn't it? If we could fly in real life, that would be much cooler than the game, though!
Oh! You're curious, aren't you? You're curious about me and this machine! Do you want to know the details?
I see...
OK. If you insist. This machine is...
a great vehicle that allows you to fly in the sky!
It's a marvelous invention, if I do say so myself! It's not an exaggeration to say that this is a Secret Technique!
Even though I worked really hard on this, nobody wants to try it...
...You seem to be a courageous young boygirl. I'll tell you how to ride this machine— the Secret Technique Sky Dash!
Oh?! That <var> wants to fly my invention instead of you?
Great! It matches my inspiration perfectly! All right! Let's get right to it!
Do this and that... Hold this handle, and pull! Then, that will be like that... And with these balloons, you're in the air!
<var> learned the Secret Technique Sky Dash!
Use the Secret Technique Sky Dash, and you can fly to a town you've been to. Select Play with <var> in the main menu, then select Secret Techniques.
You can have this machine, so be sure to enjoy many trips through the sky!
Are you enjoying Sky Dash? What kind of machine shall I make next?
