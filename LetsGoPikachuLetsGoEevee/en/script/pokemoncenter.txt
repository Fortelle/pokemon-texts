Welcome to the Pokémon Center. Would you like to rest your Pokémon?
Welcome to the Pokémon Center, <var> <var>! Would you like to rest your Pokémon?


I'll take your Pokémon for a few seconds, then.
Thanks for waiting! Your Pokémon should be all better now!
We hope to see you again!





First, let's restore your Pokémon to full health.
Please visit a Pokémon Center whenever your Pokémon's HP is getting low. And if you're planning to go far off the beaten path, you should probably remember to stock up on Potions from the Poké Mart, too. Good luck out there, Trainer!
If you have trouble winning against a strong Trainer, train your Pokémon and try again! Catching wild Pokémon and battling Trainers make your party Pokémon stronger. Good luck out there, Trainer!
There! All happy and healthy! Good luck and take care!
CHANSEY: Chansey.
MOM: Oh, goodness, <var>! You and your Pokémon have been pushing yourselves a bit too hard, haven't you? I think you could use a little rest.
MOM: Much better! You and your Pokémon are looking great now!
