I'm a huge fan of Lt. Surge, the Vermilion City Gym Leader! What?! You have his autograph?! Oh, wow, I'm super jealous!
Oh, wow! You're <var>, right...? The Champion? D-d-do you think maybe you could give me your autograph?!
Lorelei of the Elite Four is just so cool! She could freeze me solid with her icy gaze!
Whoa, hey there, Champion! You've gotta be something if you were able to defeat Lorelei!
I really admire Bruno of the Elite Four. He's a Fighting-type expert and super buff, too!
Congrats on becoming Champion! You gotta tell me, though... What was it like seeing Bruno's muscles up close and in person?!
Nobody knows who the Gym Leader of the Viridian City Gym is! It's like a mystery! I'm so curious!
So the Gym Leader of Viridian City was the Team Rocket leader, huh... But you defeated even a scary person like that! You can count me as one of your fans now!
