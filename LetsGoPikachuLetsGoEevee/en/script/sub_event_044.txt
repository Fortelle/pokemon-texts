ARCHER: You...
What could you possibly want, coming back here now? Because of you, Team Rocket was disbanded...
It's not my style to be emotional, but I wanted to give you a glimpse of how I felt.
... Never mind.
To tell you the truth... I thought you might show up, so I was writing a letter to you.
Let me read it.
"Dear <var>, "Congratulations on conquering the Pok√©mon League. "I hold no grudges against you for what you did to Team Rocket. "Instead, using this defeat as a springboard, I would like to create an even stronger Team Rocket and officially announce our comeback. "I will leave the Kanto region. I wish for your continued success here in Kanto. "Farewell.                                             Archer"
ARCHER: What did I want you to think about me by writing such a letter...? Humph.
Archer tore up the letter.
...Take care.
