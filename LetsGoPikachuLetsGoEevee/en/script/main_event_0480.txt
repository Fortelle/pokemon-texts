Wha— Hey! You're the kid that's been getting in our way all the time!
It's because of you that Team Rocket's reputation was totally smashed!
We'll never be able to face the boss at this rate!
...Which means we'll have to take our revenge on you!
???: Hold it!
Ganging up on a child... I absolutely can't forgive that.
Who're you, lady? We'll gang up and take you on, too!
???: I'll handle these three.
Could you take that other one for me?
Leave it to me!
I don't know...
???: Good answer! Now then, let's go!
???: There's no use backing down now! Here we go!
Jeez, kid, just how strong are you?!
Even three of us rushing you wasn't enough!
Those incredibly powerful Ice-type Pokémon... Who are you?
LORELEI: I am Lorelei of the Pokémon League's Elite Four!
Shall I freeze you all solid, too?
E-Elite Four?! We surrender!
LORELEI: You're a pretty talented Trainer. It was plain to see during your battle.
I see. So you're collecting Gym Badges.
I look forward to when you come to challenge the Pokémon League.
Until then, see ya!
