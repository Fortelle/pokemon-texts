Many Pokémon live only in forests and caves. You need to be persistent and look everywhere to get different species.
Have you noticed the skinny trees on the roadside? They can be chopped down with the Secret Technique called Chop Down, I hear.
The higher a Pokémon's CP is, the higher its Combat Power is! I hear CP is a value made up of various stats and things combined.
