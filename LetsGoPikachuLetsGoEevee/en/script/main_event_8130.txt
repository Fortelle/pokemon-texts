???: So, you're <var>!
LANCE: I lead the Elite Four! You can call me Lance, the dragon Trainer!
You likely know that dragons are Pokémon spoken of in legends!
They're hard to catch and raise, but their powers are superior!
They're virtually indestructible! There's no being clever with them.
Well, are you ready to lose?
Your Pokémon League challenge ends with me, <var>!

LANCE: I still can't believe my dragons lost to you...
<var>! You are now the Pokémon League Champion!
... ... ...
...Or, you would have been, but you have one more challenge left. There is one more Trainer to face!
That Trainer is—
OAK: Hello there, <var>! Congratulations on your victory over Lance!
Hm? What's with that look of surprise?
LANCE: Haha... Your timing is perfect, Professor.
<var>! The one you will face is...
Professor Oak!
Well, not really.
It's <var>! He beat the Elite Four before you.
He is the Pokémon League Champion.
OAK: That's right!
In the past, Trainers who defeated the Elite Four were only recorded as Champions.
This time, however, we'll be officially establishing the Champion as a part of the Pokémon League!
LANCE: Professor Oak is here to officiate the crowning of the new Champion.
It seems only fitting that it should be either you or <var>! You're the two who took care of Team Rocket, after all!
LANCE: Now then, head onward to the stage of your final battle!
OAK: I look forward to seeing just how high the two of you and your Pokémon can climb!
LANCE: I'm glad you've come. The newly updated Pokémon League's reputation has really taken off! It's all thanks to you.
I'd feel ashamed to call myself Lance the dragon Trainer if I didn't challenge you to a battle!
LANCE: There's no way my dragon brigade is weak. ...What I'm saying is that means your strength is truly incredible!
Now then, <var>! You already know what's next, don't you?
That's right, Champion. Your final challenger awaits you on the stage of your final battle!
DRAGONITE: Kaipe!
