KOGA: Fwahahaha! If it isn't the child. It seems we are fated to meet once again. You have come at a truly opportune time. I was just thinking that I wanted to test my newly refined sinister techniques... in a battle that will end in your utter defeat!
KOGA: Fwahahaha! Today I'll not only defeat you, but I will also demonstrate my fatherly dignity to my daughter!
KOGA: With Trainers like you and <var>, the Pok√©mon League must be a place of formidable strength! Truly, it is something to be proud of! As it so happens, I have been thinking of aiming to join the Elite Four myself...
