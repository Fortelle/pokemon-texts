BRUNO: I am Bruno of the Elite Four!
Through rigorous training, people and Pokémon can become stronger—without limit.
I've lived and trained with my Fighting-type Pokémon! And that will never change!
<var>, was it?
We will grind you down with our superior power!
Hoo hah!

BRUNO: If you have defeated me, then my job is done. Ugh! I may not like it, but...go! Go face your next challenge!
BRUNO: I could feel the intensity of your battle with Lorelei, even from here!
Now it's time to show you the power of my Fighting-type Pokémon, who I've been training just as hard as you've trained your team, surely!
Hoo hah! Hoo! HAH!!!
Ugh! No! So my training is still lacking, is that it? ...Go. Do not trouble yourself on my behalf. Continue to move forward!
