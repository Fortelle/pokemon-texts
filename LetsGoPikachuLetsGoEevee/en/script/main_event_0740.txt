???: So! You defeated Archer...
I must say—I am impressed you got here.
Team Rocket captures Pokémon from around the world. They're important tools for keeping our criminal enterprise going.
And I am the leader of this enterprise...Giovanni!
...What? You want me to release the Cubone?
CUBONE: Maaa maaa!
GIOVANNI: Fwahahahaha!
You came barging into our hideout just for that?
What an amusing child.
But... For your insolence, you will feel a world of pain!

GIOVANNI: So I too am defeated by a child...
Do as you wish with that Cubone.
CUBONE: Maaa!
And take this. As my apology for mocking you as a child.
Giovanni handed you the Silph Scope!
...I can see you raise Pokémon with utmost care.
But you would never understand what I hope to achieve.
... ... ... I shall step aside this time!
But I hope we will meet and battle again!
CUBONE: Maaa maff!
Cubone headed back to Lavender Town.
Maybe with the Silph Scope, you'll be able to find out the identity of that ghost...?
ARCHER: ...Cubone seems to have gone home on its own. Why don't you get out of here, too, and try to figure out how to use that Silph Scope or something?
