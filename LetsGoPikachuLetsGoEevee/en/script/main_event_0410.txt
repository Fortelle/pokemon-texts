<var>: Oh! There you are, <var>!
Thanks again for the ticket. This ship is huge—and it's full of Trainers!
BLUE: Bonjour! If it isn't <var> and <var>! Didn't think I'd be seeing the two of you here!
<var>: Hey, Blue!
Are you taking a cruise?
BLUE: Not hardly. I got invited to the exclusive party for Trainers, but I'm pretty much done with this scene. I got plenty of party favors, too. Here... I can even share one with you.
You got a Shalour Sable from Blue!
More importantly, though... you wanna know what I overheard at the party? You guys know about Team Rocket, right?
They're the bad guys!
I battled them before...
BLUE: Yup. There are all kinds of rumors going around about the things they get up to.
BLUE: Seriously? You must be fearless or something, kid.
Anyway, the point is this: Team Rocket is a dangerous group, and they're trying to use Pokémon to make themselves rich. I might do some digging into what it is they're really after... And you two'd better stay out of their path!
<var>: Team Rocket, huh... <var>, if you get tangled up with those jerks again, you should call me!
<var>: Blue's real strong. I heard he beat the Pokémon League's Elite Four years ago. And I heard he's got a rival who even managed to beat him, too! How strong would someone have to be to beat Blue in battle? I can't even imagine it!
