GIOVANNI: Fwahahaha! Welcome to my hideout!
It shall be so until I can restore Team Rocket to its former glory.
But you have found me again. So be it. This time, I'm not holding back!
Once more, then!
You shall face Giovanni, the greatest Trainer!

Yet again, I am defeated... As proof of your victory... here is your Earth Badge!
You got an Earth Badge from Giovanni!
An Earth Badge makes all Pokémon obey you... regardless of how high their level is or who originally caught them.
It is proof of your mastery as a Pokémon Trainer. With it, you can challenge the Pokémon League.
And this TM... A gift for a Trainer who dares take on the challenge of the Pokémon League.
You got <var> <var> from Giovanni!
TM41 contains Earthquake. It's a powerful attack that causes a massive tremor to deal damage to opponents.
I made it...a very long time ago. Back when I ran this Gym, far too long ago.
I can't face my followers after being defeated like this. Team Rocket is... As of today, Team Rocket is finished!
As for myself, I shall dedicate my life to Pokémon training again.
Let us meet again someday! Farewell!
