GHOST: Begone...
Begone... intruders...
<var>: GAH! This one's even bigger than the last one!
<var>! Use the thing! The thing you used last time!
The true form of the ghost was... the restless spirit of Cubone's mother!
The mother's spirit was calmed, returning to its kind and gentle nature. It departed to the afterlife...and disappeared.
<var>: Cubone, you... You just came here because you wanted to see your mom again, huh?
CUBONE: Kew...
<var>: Sorry for thinking your mom was scary, Cubone.
<var>, I... I don't want to leave Cubone alone like this. I'm gonna go take it home. Oh! If there's someone named Fuji upstairs, do you think you could see him home, too?
You sure you're OK by yourself?
I've got this!
<var>: I-I'll be fine! I'm with Cubone now, after all! ...You've gotten pretty gutsy, haven't you, <var>?
<var>: Are you not scared at all, <var>? Man, you're full of confidence, pal! You definitely seem dependable.
What? You rescued Cubone from Team Rocket?!
When did you go and get that strong...?
Right... Well then... Guess I'll leave this up to you, <var>!
Come on, Cubone!
CUBONE: Kew!
