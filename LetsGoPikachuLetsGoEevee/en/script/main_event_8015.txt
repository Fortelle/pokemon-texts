Yo! Champ in the making! Misty, the Gym Leader of the Cerulean City Gym, is a powerful Trainer! You'll need a Pokémon of at least Lv. 15 if you want to challenge her Gym!
Show me a Pokémon of at least Lv. 15 if you want to take on the Gym!
...Impressive! I see you have a Pokémon that is at least Lv. 15. In that case...head on in! And good luck!
...You don't have a Pokémon that's at least Lv. 15? Come back once you've trained up a bit! The Cerulean City Gym will always be willing to face new challengers!
