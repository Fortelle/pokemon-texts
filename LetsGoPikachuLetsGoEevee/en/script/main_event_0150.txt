<var>: Oh! Hey, <var>!
You hoping to make it to the Pokémon League someday, too? That's where you can battle the strongest of all Pokémon Trainers... The ones they call the Elite Four!
I was hoping maybe I could get a glimpse of 'em, but the guard at the gate wouldn't even let me pass without any Badges from Pokémon Gyms!
Guess I'll just have to get there the long way: by battling and getting strong! So, <var>! I guess that means it's on!
<var>: Hmm... Maybe battling like this is just helping you get stronger, huh, <var>? Oh well! That works, too!
Let's train hard so that someday we both make it to the Pokémon League!
