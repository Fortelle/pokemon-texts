Hey, a new face! Welcome! This place is always packed with regulars.
My Pok√©mon are weak, so I often buy medicines at the department store.
Hey, you... Mmm...nmm...nom... Y'know what I heard? Seems there're several floors hidden below the Game Corner...
Mmm...nom...nmmm... I'll eat all the curry they can carry!
Yeesh... I played so much at the Game Corner that my hands are twitching. Games are way too much fun these days!
