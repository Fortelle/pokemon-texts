Do you believe in ghosts?
Really? So there are believers...
Hahaha, I guess not. That white hand on your shoulder... I'm just imagining it.
This town is famous for all of the graves made here for Pokémon... They hold memorial services in the Pokémon Tower for Pokémon that have passed away.
There's talk about ghosts appearing lately in the Pokémon Tower. I think they're the spirits of Pokémon kidnapped by Team Rocket and never seen again...
Ahhh... The smell of incense is so refreshing.

Don't go disturbing things in the Pokémon Tower!
