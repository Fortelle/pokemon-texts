LORELEI: Welcome to the Pokémon League!
Oh, looks like you finally made your way here. It sure took you a while, though!
...Well then, allow me to reintroduce myself. I am Lorelei of the Elite Four.
No one can best me when it comes to icy Pokémon.
Freezing moves are powerful. Your Pokémon will be at my mercy when they are frozen solid.
That's because frozen Pokémon can't do a thing in battle!
Hahaha! Are you ready?

LORELEI: Looks like you've gotten stronger since we last met! Go on ahead. You only got a taste of the Pokémon League's power.
LORELEI: Welcome to the Pokémon League! Hey, fantastic timing! I was just thinking how I'd like to battle you. I hope you're ready.
LORELEI: I may have lost to you, but I'll never give up on my Ice-type Pokémon! You should aim to win using Pokémon you like best, too!
