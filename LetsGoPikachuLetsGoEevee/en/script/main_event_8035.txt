Oooh... So you want to challenge Erika, the Gym Leader? I'll have you know, we only let Trainers with cute Pokémon enter the Gym! Do you have one? Here, let me see!
So, you haven't given up on getting into the Celadon City Gym, huh? Well, do you have a cute Pokémon with you? I'd better have a look to make sure!
No way you're getting into the Gym if you don't show me a cute Pokémon! Bye!
Huh? <var>?! ... It's cute! SUPER cute! Can...can I pet it? Just a bit? Pleeease?
Oh... Oh! Oh, it feels so good! I just want to bury my face in its belly! It smells good, too! I love it!
F-fine, then! I guess I have to let you into the Celadon City Gym, seeing as you brought a cute Pokémon and all.
