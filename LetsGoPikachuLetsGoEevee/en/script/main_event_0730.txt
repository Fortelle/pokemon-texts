???: Just one look at this Silph Scope, and it's plain to see...
Silph Co. definitely has the technology and skill Team Rocket will need to make our wishes come true.
???: Hmph... A machine that lets you see what otherwise cannot be seen... It's nothing but a useless toy. Still...
Yes, this could do. Carry on, Archer, with your plans to take over Silph Co. for Team Rocket.
???: Yes, sir!
What is a child doing here?
You listened in on our conversation without saying a word? I don't much care for that.
I am Archer, an Admin of Team Rocket. And I do not go easy even on children!

ARCHER: F-forgive me, Giovanni... For me to be defeated by a simple child...
