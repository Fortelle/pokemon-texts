OK, have I got all my Poké Balls on my belt? One, two, three, four, five, and...six! Yup, that'll do it! No matter how many Pokémon you have in your Pokémon Box, you can only take six into battle.
Team Rocket attacking the good people of Cerulean City...and in their own homes? Not a day goes by without Team Rocket being in the news for some crime or another.
If you catch a lot of Pokémon, you'll end up with more than you can carry around in your party. But all the ones you can't carry, you can just stow in the Pokémon Box in your Bag! So no sweat! Plus, no matter how full your Pokémon Box gets, it's easy to search to find the Pokémon you want.
When you try to catch a Pokémon, yeah? You sometimes see a green ring, yeah? That kind of Pokémon is easy to catch, yeah. If the ring's yellow, it'll be a bit harder. Yeah. And if it's a red ring, yeah, that Pokémon might be really hard to catch!
It's a newspaper.
There's a picture book titled Clefairy and the Moon.
Will you read it?
"Roly-poly Clefairy, roly-roll around. Rambling up the mountain, really gaining ground. "High upon Mt. Moon, they gaze up at the sky. Pi, pi, pi! The moon fills each last eye. "Roly-poly Clefairy, see how they spin and bound! Pi pi pi! Happy smiles all around!"
