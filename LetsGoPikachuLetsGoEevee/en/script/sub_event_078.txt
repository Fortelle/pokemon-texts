ERIKA: Oh, if it isn't the one who's been trying to fill the Pok√©dex. I do hope things have been going well for you since our last encounter. ...I see. You certainly have been busy. I'm not particularly fond of those kinds of public things... However, battles are different. That's what you came for, isn't it?
ERIKA: ...Zzz...zzz... Oh, good day to you. ...Hm? A battle? Right now? But of course. I graciously accept.
ERIKA: Simply marvelous. That was an effort worthy at least 10 Rainbow Badges.
