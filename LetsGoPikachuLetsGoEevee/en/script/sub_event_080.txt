SABRINA: ...It's true that psychic power is a potent ability. However, there are things that cannot be overcome with that power alone. I finally understand that now, after losing to you in our last battle. I won't be relying on just psychic power this time. My true strength...my true self... Allow me to test them against you!
SABRINA: I foresaw that you would come here by looking into the future. But I intentionally didn't look to see who will win our battle. Let's find out now, together!
SABRINA: There was once a time when I was shocked that I lost to you. That feeling is gone now. It's been replaced with a desire to grow strong and live freely, as you do.
