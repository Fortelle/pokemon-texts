"Here I am at the Seafoam Islands in my search for Pokémon I've never seen before! "I came across some rapids underground that were too fast to swim across. "I was exploring that area when, suddenly, I was hit by a blast of freezing cold. "It was as if I was stuck in a blizzard! It got so cold, I began to black out. "As my consciousness faded, I saw a pair of shiny wings over the waves. "...Could that have been the Legendary Pokémon Articuno?! "When I came to, I was lying on the ground outside of the cave, for some reason... "I need to practice my swimming so that next time I can capture Articuno for sure!"
"Here I am at the abandoned Power Plant in my search for Pokémon I've never seen before! "I had no idea you could reach this place by swimming from that spot on Route 10. "As I was exploring, one of the Poké Balls lying around suddenly attacked me! "It made a huge explosion and knocked me out! "But I do remember seeing some jagged-looking wings as I blacked out. "...Could that have been the Legendary Pokémon Zapdos?! "When I came to, I found myself lying outside the Power Plant... "As soon as I become able to withstand those explosions, I'm going back to catch Zapdos!"
"Here I am at Victory Road in my search for Pokémon I've never seen before! "It seems you can't get very far without doing something about the stone walls in the way. "As I was exploring the cave, I saw the most beautiful Pokémon. "It was so beautiful that I got overwhelmed and passed out. "As I did, though, I saw it flap its brightly burning wings. "...Could that have been the Legendary Pokémon Moltres?! "When I came to, I was all alone... "Next time, I've got to stay conscious so I can capture Moltres for sure!"
