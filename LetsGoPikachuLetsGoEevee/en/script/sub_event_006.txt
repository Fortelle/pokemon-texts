Uh... I...I'm... Who in the world am I...? Bah, it's no use. I can't remember anything...
Hm? Do you think you could tell me who I might be?
Move Deleter
Mr. Dazzling
I don't know
I'm the Move Deleter...? Could that be...? No, no, it just doesn't feel right...
Ah, don't mind me! Sorry to bother you with such an odd question.
I'm Mr. Dazzling...?! That has such a wonderful ring to it! Mr. Dazzling! You must be right! I'm Mr. Dazzling!
Well, you helped me remember, so...here!
TM32 is for Dazzling Gleam! It's a Fairy-type moveâ€”something that's hard to find in Kanto!
