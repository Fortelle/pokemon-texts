ARCHER: That's far enough!
<var>: Wha—?! You again?!
ARCHER: Me again. As many times as it takes. I will not let you reach the boss!
<var>: ...Huh? What was that? Reach the boss?
<var>, d'you think—?!
He's right up ahead!
Giovanni must be here!
<var>: So the boss of Team Rocket is right here in this building! That makes things easier, then!
<var>: Go, <var>! This is our best chance to beat their boss!
Old man, you'll be dealing with me!
ARCHER: Ugh! I don't have time for this! I must warn the boss!
<var>: <var>, go! Go beat the Team Rocket boss once and for all!
