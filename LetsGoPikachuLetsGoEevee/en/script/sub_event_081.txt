BLAINE: Hah! Well done, returning here to my Gym! You're the one who retrieved the key to this Gym from the Pokémon Mansion! Did you see anything interesting while you were in there? That place still holds the remnants of my old friend's research! By the way, I've been hearing an interesting rumor floating around recently... You wouldn't happen to know a young lady named Green, would you? ...Hmph, well, it's not as though I really know the whole story anyway. More importantly, since you came all this way, we should have a battle! Hah!
BLAINE: The Cinnabar Island volcano seems quite active today! Which means that my Fire-type Pokémon will be in top shape today, too! Let's go! Hah!
BLAINE: Recently, Gym challengers sure have been increasing! That just means more fun for me, so I don't mind at all! It's true that you already have a Volcano Badge, but don't worry about that—let's battle!
