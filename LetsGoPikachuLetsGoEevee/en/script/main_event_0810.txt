JESSIE: Stop right there! We'll be going first!
JAMES: With that specter out of the way, we can finally get to the top!
JESSIE: You're the old geezer they call Mr. Fuji, right?
You're going to be repeating your Pokémon research for the glory of Team Rocket!
MR. FUJI: ... ... ...
JAMES: Ignore us all you like—we're used to it! We won't take no for an answer. You'll help the boss, whether you want to or not!
JESSIE: Gramps here thinks he can resist, so we're setting him straight!
JAMES: You'd better disappear, twerp, or be prepared to fight!


JESSIE: Ugh! Seriously? Again?
JAMES: Looks like Operation Stealthily Kidnap Fuji is a bust, then...
JESSIE: Don't you think I know that? It'll be fine—we just have to help out with the take-over of Silph Co. in Saffron City.
JESSIE & JAMES: Looks like Team Rocket's blasting off again!
JESSIE: Hey, twerp, you can't battle the both of us with just one Pokémon! You'd better go get another and come back to take us on!
