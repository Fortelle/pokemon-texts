I go shopping in Pewter City occasionally. I have to take the winding trail in Viridian Forest when I go.

Oh ho! So you're working on a Pokédex! Then I'll give you a piece of advice. You'd do well to stock up on Poké Balls at a Poké Mart before you continue your adventure!
???: What do you want? You can't pass through here right now! We're in the middle of guard duty, and it's very important!
???: How many times do I have to tell you? You can't pass through here right now! Don't children like you have errands to run or something?
???: What're you doing here, twerp? Shoo! Go pester someone else!
???: I know it's our mission to keep watch here, but it's so boring! I wish we could go kill time in the Poké Mart or something...
MEOWTH: Mrowr!
