Look at what Team Rocket have done to my house! And they stole my TM, the one that can teach Pok√©mon like Mankey and Sandshrew the move Dig...
Oh, you retrieved the TM? Thank you very much! You can keep that, though. I've decided to take my time training Diglett and have them learn Dig that way.
Team Rocket must be trying to dig their way into something no good!
There is a hole in the wall. You can get out using the hole.
