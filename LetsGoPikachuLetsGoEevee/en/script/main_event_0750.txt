<var>: So that's Cubone's mom...?!
GIRL: That's right! Team Rocket keeps on going after Marowak so it can sell those skulls they wear for profit... I think Cubone is still looking for its mother, even though she's gone... I just can't forgive that Team Rocket!
<var>: Me neither! I saw Cubone heading into the tower a little while ago, too... I'll go look for itâ€”and I'll keep an eye out for that Mr. Fuji, too! The one who's been missing!
GIRL: Thank you... And be careful!
<var>: I r-really don't like ghosts... But I've gotta do this!
