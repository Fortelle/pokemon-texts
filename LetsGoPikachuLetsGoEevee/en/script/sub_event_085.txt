JESSIE: Just let us through already!
No way! Only authorized members are allowed. I was told to let no one else in.
JAMES: How can you say that when we're on the same side?!
JESSIE: How rude! You'd deny a beautiful girl what she wants?
Move it, already!
JAMES: Hey! Jessie! Wait for me!
I'm a security guard. And I don't let suspicious kids in!
