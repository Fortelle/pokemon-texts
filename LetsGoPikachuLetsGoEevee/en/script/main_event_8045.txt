Yo! Champ in the making! Surprised by all the glitz and glam? Saffron City is the biggest city in Kanto, and its Gym gets its fair share of challengers, too! You'll need to have a Pokémon that's at least Lv. 45 if you want to stand any chance. Well? Do you have one?
Show me a Pokémon that's at least Lv. 45 if you want to challenge the Saffron City Gym!
... No problem! That's a Pokémon that's at least Lv. 45, all right! Well then! Fly off to meet the Gym Leader, Sabrina!
... I guess you don't have a Pokémon that's at least Lv. 45, huh? Come back once you do! The Saffron City Gym won't be going anywhere!
