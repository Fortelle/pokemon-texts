<var>: Wait up!
Come on, <var>! You do know you can do more with Pokémon than just catch 'em, right? If you're a Trainer, you can have Pokémon battles with other Trainers, too! I'll show you exactly what I mean!
It's battle time!

<var>: Aw, jeez... There I went mouthing off like I knew everything, and then I lost! How embarrassing! I probably should've trained my Pokémon up a bit before trying a battle like that, huh?
<var>: Yes! I did it! ...Oh! But don't worry about one little loss, OK?
Let's battle again sometime!
OAK: Did you enjoy your first taste of battle, young <var>? Your partner <var> seemed to like it!
OAK: Battle against many Trainers, and help your Pokémon grow strong! And keep catching more and more new Pokémon while you're at it, too!
