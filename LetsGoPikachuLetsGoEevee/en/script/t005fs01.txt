I'm searching for items that boost a Pokémon's stats for the length of one battle. X Attack, X Defense, X Speed, and X Sp. Atk... Those are what I'm after! Do you know where I can get them?
Did you buy some Revives? They'll revive a Pokémon that fainted. They're really handy!
If a Support Trainer battles alongside you, you can have two Pokémon on your side to take on one opposing Pokémon! You can have the upper hand!
