Hello. It's ₽50 for kids. Would you like to come in?
Come again!
Right, ₽50! Thank you!
You don't have enough money.
Please enjoy yourself.
You can't sneak in the back way! Nice try, kid, but no. Oh, whatever! Do you know what amber is?
There's a lab somewhere trying to resurrect creatures from amber, which contains the genetic material of ancient creatures.
Amber is actually sap—that gooey stuff that oozes from trees. The ancient sap fossilized over time to become rock-hard amber.
