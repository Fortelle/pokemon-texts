The Pokémon Tower was erected in the memory of Pokémon that passed away.
Did you come to pay respects? Bless your Pokémon-loving heart, son.
Did you come to pay respects? Bless your Pokémon-loving heart, girl.
I can't forget my dearly departed Clefairy. *sob* Oh, this won't do. I'm awash in tears...
My sweet Growlithe... Why did you have to die and leave me?
I am a channeler—one who speaks to spirits. I sense a lost spirit somewhere high in this tower.
The presence of the lost spirit I sensed farther up the tower has...disappeared!
