OAK: Why, <var>! Back so soon? How is little <var> doing?
Hm? Hmmm?!
OAK: Goodness me! <var> here seems like it's really come to be a true partner to you, <var>! I think you've got what it takes to become a great Pokémon Trainer!
...What's that? You have something for me?
You handed the professor his parcel!
OAK: Oh! So my order arrived! Thank you for bringing it to me!


<var>: Hey, Professor Oak! It's about my <var>! Its moves are—
Whoa! <var>! That's so cool! <var> just rides on you like that?!
OAK: Ah! And now we have <var> as well! What fine timing. I've just been delivered some very handy items, which I think I'll share with the two of you!
You got some Razz Berries from Professor Oak!
<var>: Great! I've been starving!
OAK: I'll stop you right there, son! Those Berries are for Pokémon to eat, not you! When you want to catch a Pokémon, try throwing one of those at your target before you take a Poké Ball in hand. You'll find that wild Pokémon will be so happy to have a Berry to nibble on that they'll become much easier for you to catch!
<var>: That was close... I nearly swallowed one of 'em right up myself!
OAK: Now then, you two! It's up to you to decide if you want to catch lots of different Pokémon or simply focus on training up your favorites. My only request is that you have fun either way!
<var>: As for me... I wanna catch tons of different Pokémon! But I wanna train them up to be strong, too! Heh!
OAK: I hope you get the chance to meet many different Pokémon in your journeys!
