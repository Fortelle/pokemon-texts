MISTY: Oh, it's you again!
Oooh, wow. So you beat Lt. Surge? You must be pretty good! Glad to see you're really learning a thing or two. And your Pokémon must've tried their best!
Misty healed your Pokémon for you!

MISTY: Oh, me? I'm going swimming in the sea. There are times when you just want to break free from a puny little pool and swim in the big blue!
Where are you headed next? Have you been to Diglett's Cave? It's pretty close by. If you haven't been, I could show you the way. Want a guide?
Oh? Well, that's some way to turn down such a nice offer.
Great! Then let's go!
MISTY: This is Diglett's Cave! Diglett dug out this cave path all on their own! OK, see ya! Be sure to meet lots of Pokémon!
