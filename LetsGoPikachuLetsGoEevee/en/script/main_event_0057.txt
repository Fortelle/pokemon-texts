MOM: Oh, how cute! This is the one you got from the professor?
...What? You caught it yourself?! That's amazing! What should I call your new friend? ...<var>? It's a lovely Pok√©mon!
Pikachuuuu!
Eeveeeee!
MOM: My, how energetic!
I suppose that means you two will be setting off on an adventure today, right? I thought this day might come soon, so I planned ahead and got this for you.
You got a Town Map from Mom!

By using that Town Map in your Bag, you'll always know exactly where you are. Safe travels, dear! You and <var> be good to each other!
