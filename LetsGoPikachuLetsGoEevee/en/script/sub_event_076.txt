MISTY: I heard an interesting rumor! Not only did you and that other kid defeat those Team Rocket guys, but you also met again in the battle for Champion. Argh! I just can't take it anymore! You've gotten so strong that I just absolutely have to battle you again! You got that? No refusing!
MISTY: My adorable Pokémon are ready to take you on! The ultimate offensive of Water-type Pokémon! I hope you're ready!
MISTY: I lost... I need to try swimming around for a bit so that I can clear my head of these feelings. ...I definitely won't lose next time!
