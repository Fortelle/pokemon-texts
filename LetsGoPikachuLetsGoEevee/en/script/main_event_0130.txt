<var>: Huh? You look pretty pleased about something, <var>. ...Oh, you beat another Trainer? Good job!
Well, since we're on the topic... The Pokémon you sent into battle might've lost some HP or PP...
You should take 'em to a Pokémon Center and get them healed up! It doesn't cost any money and doesn't take long at all, either.
Just remember—heal up after battles!
