BLUE: Yo, <var>! Since I've become the Gym Leader here, the Viridian City Gym has really stepped it up! It's made each day pretty busy, though! By the way... what do you think of this Gym's design? It makes me look like some kinda bad guy, right? I've been thinking of remodeling the place. Well, it doesn't matter all that much, I guess. No matter the place, I'm still the best there is! All right! It's been a while since I've gone all out. So I'll show you the strength of a top Trainer!
BLUE: Oh ho! Couldn't stand being away from my greatness? <var> just came by recently, too! That one's been getting pretty strong recently. You'd better watch out! All right! Let's get started! No way I'm losing this time!
BLUE: As long as I can battle strong opponents, I don't care what happens! You get what I mean, right? You'd better come back again!
