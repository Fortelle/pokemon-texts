Hey! You came up from Pallet Town?
You must know Professor Oak, right? I've got a delivery for him, but I really can't leave the Poké Mart unattended right now. Can I get you to take this to Professor Oak for me?
You took the Parcel from the Poké Mart clerk!
Thanks, kid! Say hi to Professor Oak for me, too.

Do you want to head straight back to the lab?
