BLUE: So you're my first challenger, huh, <var>?
That's what I like to hear! Here I go!

BLUE: Hmph. Your loss, I guess.
BLUE: Oh, man! So you really are ready for Team Rocket! I feel pretty good about leaving this place in your hands!


Then you're next, <var>! Come at me—I'm just getting warmed up!

<var>: Aw, jeez... Just watching your battle made me nervous... Did you see his Pokémon's eyes? They blew me away...but I'm not backing down! <var>, you go on ahead! I'll be right behind you!
RECEPTIONIST: Blue is a famously strong Trainer, you know... And he didn't look like he was holding back much, either. You must be pretty special yourself! I hope you really can save Silph!
