CAPTAIN: Oooargh... I feel terrible... Urrp! This seasickness...has done me in...
You rubbed the captain's back!
There, there, old fellow...
CAPTAIN: Whew! Thank you! I'm feeling much better now.
So what did you want from me? Oh, you want to learn my Secret Technique? Of course I'd be happy to teach it! Come along with me...
Pika pika!
Eeeveee!
CAPTAIN: Hahaha! That <var> looks more than ready to learn my Secret Technique... But I'm afraid it's really only for humans!
What's this? You really want to try to learn it, no matter what?
Well, color me surprised! I've traveled all over this wide world, and this is the first time I've had a Pok√©mon want to learn my Secret Technique...
But with spirit like that... Well then, who am I to say no? I'll teach my special Secret Technique even to that <var> of yours!
Come with me, little friend.
Now watch carefully.
... ... ...

Hyah! Dah!


<var> learned the Secret Technique Chop Down!
CAPTAIN: Whoa-ho! It really went and learned Chop Down!
Using Chop Down, your <var> will be able to help you chop down thin trees. You could go give it a try, uh... That's right! How about on the trees around Vermilion City?
CAPTAIN: Whew! Now I guess it's about time for the S.S. Anne to set sail again! This may be good-bye for now. Until the next time we return to Vermilion City!
