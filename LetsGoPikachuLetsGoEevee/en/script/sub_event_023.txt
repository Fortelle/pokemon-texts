KARATE MASTER: *grunt* I am the Karate Master! I am the leader here!
You wish to challenge us? Expect no mercy!
Fwaaa!
KARATE MASTER: Indeed, I have lost!
But I beseech you—do not take our emblem as your trophy!
In return, I will give you a prized Fighting-type Pokémon!
Choose whichever one you like!
KARATE MASTER: Hyah! Stay and train at karate with us!
KARATE MASTER: You want the hard-kicking Hitmonlee?
You got <var> from the Karate Master!
KARATE MASTER: You want the piston-punching Hitmonchan?
You can only choose one.
HITMONLEE: Kikick!
HITMONCHAN: Knnnnuckle!
