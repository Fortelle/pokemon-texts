JAMES: The boss is missing... Ahh... What's going to happen to Team Rocket?
JESSIE: Argh! Don't be such a wimp! This is the boss we're talking about! He's hiding himself for now, but he must be preparing for the next scheme!
JAMES: ...Yeah, of course! Then let's steal Pokémon all over the world to help the boss!
MEOWTH: ...Mrawr!
JAMES: Ah! It's that annoying twerp again!
JESSIE: Why are you eavesdropping on us?
JAMES: Those who are in Team Rocket's way won't get away unscathed!
JESSIE: Hey, twerp, you can't battle the both of us with just one Pokémon! You'd better go get another and come back to take us on!
JESSIE: You're just a twerp. Why are you so strong?
...Is it because of that <var>? You can probably go all out because you're with that Pokémon.
JAMES: With that <var>, we may be able to conquer the world! Hey, do you want to join Team Rocket?
No way!
Well...
JAMES: OK. Fine. Humph, we're enemies after all!
But if you do change your mind, come back anytime. I'll give you this. I made it myself.
You got a Blast-Off Set from Team Rocket!
You put the Blast-Off Set in your Clothing Trunk!
JESSIE: ... What's this? Why do I feel so refreshed? You've been such a troublesome little twerp, and yet...
JAMES: It's great to have times like this for a change once in a while, isn't it?
JESSIE: You might be right.
JESSIE & JAMES: We feel great!
MEOWTH: Meow, meow!
