Hahaha! What's that? You say the elevator doesn't work? Course not! I've been keeping the Lift Key safe this whole time!

Gah! Now how am I supposed to keep you from taking the Lift Key?! Guess I'll have to use my own kind of Struggle!
I hope my bosses don't hear about this!
Hah...hah... Phew! Without that key, there's no way you'll make it to the boss! If you think you can get it back from up there, then I'd sure like to see you try! Haha!
There's no way you're getting that Lift Key now! Not unless you know some way to walk on top of the walls or something. ...Like that'd happen!
That Pok√©mon of yours looks pretty nimble, I gotta say...
You got the Lift Key!
