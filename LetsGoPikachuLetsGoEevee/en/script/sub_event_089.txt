Hmm, I don't think the Pokémon in your party would work. Come back again with some different Pokémon!
Wow, your Pokémon is riding on you! That's super cute!
But I think my Pokémon would be a bit too heavy for me. That's why I have it walk with me instead!
ODDISH: Oddly!
Check your party in the main menu and choose a Pokémon to take out of its Poké Ball, and it will walk around with you!
It's just adorable to see them! Here, let me do it for you!
Just wandering around with your Pokémon can be so much fun! ...But you already know that, right?
