It seems Team Rocket is planning to make Silph create a strong Pokémon. Arghhh... But I don't want them to take this Porygon I created! I've got to get it out of here somehow...
PORYGON: Jagjag...
Huh? Did you get rid of all those Team Rocket thugs? Thank you so much! What do you say? Do you want to try your hand at raising a Pokémon created by Silph?

Porygon is so blocky and cute!
PORYGON: Jagjag!
