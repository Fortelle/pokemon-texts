<var>: <var>!
I finally caught up to you! I got an Earth Badge, too! That means we can finally get into the Pokémon League!
I heard the Elite Four are incredibly strong... But there's no turning back now, right?
You think you're ready, <var>? Show me the Pokémon you've raised!
You know, <var>... I've always felt like I needed to look after you, ever since we were young. But I think... I think you're the one who has more talent as a Trainer.
It's...frustrating. I've never felt this way before. Is this what makes it fun to raise Pokémon?
Whatever it is, I know I don't want to lose again!
It's weird to even have to ask, but... let me go on ahead first!
