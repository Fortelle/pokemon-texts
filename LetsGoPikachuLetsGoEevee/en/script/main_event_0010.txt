???: I'm coming up!
Up and at 'em!
<var>: Morning, <var>!
What's going on? You've got one weird look on your face!
Aw, never mind that! I couldn't wait any longer, so I came to get you! Today's finally the big day! We're finally going to get our first Pok√©mon from Professor Oak and become real Trainers!
Oh, but before we do...
You read the email I sent you yesterday, right? You'd better have! Check your computer if you didn't!
I'm gonna book it to Professor Oak's lab, so see you there!
