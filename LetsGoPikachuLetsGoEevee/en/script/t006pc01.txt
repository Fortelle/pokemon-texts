Even if Pokémon are the same level, that doesn't mean one is always as strong as another. But a weak Pokémon can get stronger the more Candies you give them...or so I hear.
When my Pokémon was poisoned the other day, it healed its own poisoning so I wouldn't worry! It must love me lots, don't you think?
It's true that higher-level Pokémon are stronger... But all Pokémon have weaknesses, too, based on their types. Basically, you're gonna have a hard time finding one all-powerful Pokémon.
There's a magazine called Pokémon Journal: The Foodie Edition.
Will you read it?
"The latest taste sensation that everyone is talking about... That's right! It's Pewter City's Pewter Crunchies! "They're rugged and bumpy and brown, and honestly, they look just like a bunch of rocks... "But what really matters is the taste! So dig right in and— Argh! I-it's so hard... "Hard to stop eating after just one, I mean! Yes, these snacks are as hard as that Geodude used by Brock of the Pewter City Gym! "Phew... They're so deliciously dense that my jaw is feeling pretty tired from all this chewing. "But back to the taste... They've got a nice hint of soy sauce flavoring, and they're fantastic!"
