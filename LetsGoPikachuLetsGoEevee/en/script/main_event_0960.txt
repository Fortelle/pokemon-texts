<var>: <var>, you did it! You beat Giovanni, right?
That Archer guy made a run for it, so I chased him all the way out here, and then... all the Team Rocket Grunts ran right outta Saffron City, too!
Guess we're lucky you're such a strong Trainer, <var>!
To be honest, I was a little scared. Like, what would have happened to us if it turned out the bad guys were the strongest, you know?
But you and me, <var>... We really managed to save Silph! Nobody will have to go through what Cubone went through ever again!
All right! Now that everything's back to normal, I guess it's time for the next Pokémon Gym! Have you been to the Saffron City Gym already, <var>? How many Badges have you got? ...That many, huh? Wow.
Maybe we'll both make it all the way to the Pokémon League!
Let's both give it our best shot! See ya!
