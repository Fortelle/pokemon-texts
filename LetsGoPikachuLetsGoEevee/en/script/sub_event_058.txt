My bike collection is impressive, isn't it? I won't let you ride or buy one, but feel free to have a look.
It's a shiny bike. It looks expensive!
Are you curious about that bike?
I like simple bikes, too. It was a limited edition and popular a while ago.
The refreshing color of the frame perfectly matches nature!
It costs â‚½1,000,000! Bike enthusiasts are tormented by its super rarity!
Although its performance is average, it's super easy to ride.
It's even easy for beginners to ride!
OK...
It's a shiny bike. It looks very fast!
Are you curious about those Mach Bikes?
As its name suggests, a Mach Bike is super fast.
The frame in pursuit of lightness! Ultimate reduced air resistance!
If you put weight on the carbon handlebars, it accelerates to top speed in a second!
With the momentum, you can climb any hills with ease!
It's a bit difficult to control, but even that is a lovable feature of the bike.
It's a shiny bike. It looks tough!
Are you curious about those Acro Bikes?
It's by far the wildest bike and very different from other bikes. That is the Acro Bike!
It allows you to perform actions such as wheelies and bunny hops.
You can even ride it on raised walkways or trackless paths!
You can do acrobatic stuff, so it's called an Acro Bike. That is my own theory, though.
If you value techniques more than anything else, that is the bike for you!
You're the first person who listened to all of my nerdy talk.
You must be a nerd, too! As a token of our new friendship, please take this!
My bike collection... ...Oh, it's you! You can look at my bikes as long as you want!
