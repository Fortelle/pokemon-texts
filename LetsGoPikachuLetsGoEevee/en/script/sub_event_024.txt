Hiya! I am an important doctor. Yes, very well known indeed. Here, I study rare Pokémon Fossils. Hey! Do you have a Fossil for me?
Helix Fossil
Dome Fossil
Old Amber
Quit
No! Too bad!
Success! The Fossil was <var> as I thought!
You got <var> from the doctor!
Oh! That is <var>, it is! It is a Fossil of <var>, a Pokémon that is already extinct! Shall I use my Resurrection Machine to make that Pokémon live again?
So! Give it here!
You handed over the <var> to the odd doctor.

Well then! Come back soon!
