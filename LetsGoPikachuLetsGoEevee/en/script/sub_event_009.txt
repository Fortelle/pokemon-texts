I'm the chairman of the Pokémon Fan Club! I raise more than a hundred Pokémon! I'm very fussy when it comes to Pokémon! I surely am! So... Did you come visit to hear about my Pokémon?
Oh! You see, my favorite, Rapidash, is the cutest! It's SO cute and lovely and smart... It's almost too much to take! Plus, it's really amazing when you stop to look at it. Don't you think so? Oh yes. Its looks are so stunning, and its heart is so kind... You can't help but love it! And when you hug it tight when it's sleeping— it's so warm and cuddly... Plus, it looks spectacular, of course. Oh, and it's simply ravishing when— Oops! Look at the time! I kept you too long! Thanks for hearing me out! I want you to have this!
