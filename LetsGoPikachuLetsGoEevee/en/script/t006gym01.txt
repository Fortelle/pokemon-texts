I've been waiting for you, champ in the making! Lt. Surge here is the Gym Leader in this city. He's an expert on Electric-type Pokémon and a real tough guy! Flying- and Water-type Pokémon don't do well matched up against Electric types. You'll also want to watch out so your Pokémon don't get stuck paralyzed! And here's my last tip... Lt. Surge is the cautious type. He's put barriers between himself and the rest of this room, so it won't be easy getting to him.
Whew! That match was electric! It was so blinding—I'm still seeing stars!

Nope! There's only trash here.
Hey! There's a switch under the trash?! Let's push it!
The first electric barrier was deactivated!
The second electric barrier was deactivated! The electric barriers are completely gone now!
Hey! The electric barrier was reactivated!
It's a red trash can!
It's a blue trash can!
You've already pushed the switch in this can.
