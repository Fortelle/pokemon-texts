<var>: Oh! <var>!
Did you learn how to use Light Up from Professor Oak's assistant, too?
Wha...? You didn't learn it...but <var> did?! That partner of yours really is amazing, <var>...
Hey, you know what? I actually know someplace where you might be able to use it! Want me to take you there?
Yeah, let's go together
Naw, I'm fine by myself
All right! We'll be there in no time. Come on!
So, just head east here from Cerulean City...
That's this directionâ€”got it? Just keep going this way, and you'll eventually hit this cave system called the Rock Tunnel. I hear it's pitch dark!
If you use Light Up, though, you don't have to be scared of the dark! See you around!
Really? Well, OK... You sure you'll be all right?
Yeah, I want to go alone
Actually, let's go together
OK! Just in case, though, let me give you directions. If you head east from Cerulean City, you'll reach a place called the Rock Tunnel. It's supposed to be pitch dark in there. Be careful!
