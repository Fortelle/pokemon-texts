Hi! Remember me? I'm one of Professor Oak's assistants. The professor told me that if your Pokédex has good data on 50 species of Pokémon, I'm to give you this wonderful item. So, <var>, let me ask you... Have you gathered data on at least 50 species of Pokémon?
Great! You have caught <var> species of Pokémon! Congratulations! Here, take this wonderful item!
...Oh, I don't have it! D-d-did I lose it?!
Ah, so sorry. What shall I do...? I don't have anything I can give you... I know!
Whoooooosh!
Heh...huh...heh... Phew! OK! Here it is!
You got an Assistant Set from Professor Oak's assistant!
You put the Assistant Set in your Clothing Trunk!
I made adjustments on my lab coat for you and your Pokémon. My precious lab coat... Please wear it with care.
Now I look like an ordinary person, but please remember that I'm an assistant to Professor Oak.
Let's see... Uh-oh! You've only caught <var> species of Pokémon! You've got to reach 50 species if you want this wonderful item from me.
...Oh. I see. When you get 50 species of Pokémon, come back for this wonderful item.
