A Poké Flute awakens sleeping Pokémon. It does so with a sound that only they can hear.

If I had a Pokémon, I would go to Pokémon Road, too!
There's a magazine called Pokémon Best Spots.

"The amazing spot we're introducing this time is Pokémon Road! "It's the sloping road that connects Celadon City and Fuchsia City! "During the weekend, many Trainers walk around with their Pokémon on Pokémon Road. "Sometimes, Pokémon that become friends there become matchmakers for their Trainers...or not."
