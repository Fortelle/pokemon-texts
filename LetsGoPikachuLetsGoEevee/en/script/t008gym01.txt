The Fuchsia City Gym is a tricked-up place. It's riddled with invisible walls! Koga might look within reach, sure... but it's not always that easy! You'll have to find the gaps in the walls if you hope to reach him for a battle.
It's amazing how terrifying ninjas can be, even today in the modern age!
