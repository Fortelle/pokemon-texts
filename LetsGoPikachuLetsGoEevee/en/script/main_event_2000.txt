<var>: Anybody home?
Hey, <var>! I'm coming up!
<var>: Morning, Kanto Champion!
But don't get too comfortable with that title. I plan on stealing it from you soon!
First, though... Did you hear the rumors? There's talk going around about some crazy strong-looking Pokémon being spotted...
What kind of Pokémon?
I want to catch it!
I hear it looks super strong—and super cool!
Ha! I knew you wouldn't be able to resist a rumor like that!
The Pokémon was seen near Cerulean City!
And apparently it ran away into a cave somewhere there. That's all I know.
So! I say we both go try to catch this Pokémon!
Whoever catches it first is the winner!
