Viridian City: The Eternally Green Paradise
Viridian City Pokémon Gym
The doors to the Viridian City Pokémon Gym are locked tight!

Trainer Tips If you run out of Poké Balls, you can buy more at a Poké Mart!
Trainers' School: Get Schooled in School!
Those Poké Balls you've got! You have Pokémon, don't you. It's great that you can carry and use your Pokémon anytime, anywhere.
This Pokémon Gym is always closed... I wonder who the Gym Leader is...
The Viridian City Gym Leader has returned!
Did you know there are actually two kinds of caterpillar Pokémon?
Caterpie has no poison, but Weedle does. Watch that your Pokémon aren't hit with Weedle's Poison Sting.
Oh, then good!

ODDISH: Compaaah!
Yo there, kid from Pallet Town!
