Your world has expanded after becoming Champion!
You can now fly up in the sky with Charizard, Aerodactyl, and Dragonite anywhere you want.
Hey, sorry to bug you while your world's expanding.
Remember me? I'm Ronny from Route 1.
Now that you've successfully become Champion, I've got some news for you!
The Master Trainers—Trainers that have spent their whole careers training one specific Pokémon—have appeared throughout Kanto.
I'd say challenging the Pikachu Master is a good place to start. Head to Viridian Forest if you want to face her!
I'd say challenging the Eevee Master is a good place to start. Head to Pokémon Road if you want to face her!
If you want to know the details, talk to me!
What do you want to know about the Master Trainers?
Who are they?
How do I battle them?
About titles
Nothing
The Master Trainers have each focused on training one species of Pokémon. They're always thinking about the Pokémon they've spent all that time with, so you should be able to find them pretty easily.
If you have the same species of Pokémon as them, you'll be able to battle them, one-on-one. Neither side will be allowed to use items, so it will be a battle of pure skill! If you win, you'll receive a title and you'll be able to use it from that point on.
You can change the title you're using at the game company in Celadon City. Show it off during Link Battles!
Good luck!
