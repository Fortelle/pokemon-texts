You can meet a lot of Pokémon by battling many Trainers!
Some Pokémon tend to run away or are on alert when you use the bike's bell or whistle through your fingers. You may want to approach them while crouching.
Trading Pokémon with other Trainers can also help you fill your Pokédex. Using Surprise Trade is highly recommended as well.
Some Pokémon can be found by hatching Eggs.
Do you fish? Quite a lot of Pokémon can be found only by fishing.
Evolving Pokémon is necessary to find some Pokémon. There are many ways to evolve Pokémon, such as using an item.
