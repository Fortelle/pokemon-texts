There's a strong <var>-type reaction coming from within the den!
Which path would you like to take?
Everyone talked it out, and the group decided to take this path!
Would you like to take the <var> you caught along with you?
I want to swap Pokémon!
I'm good without it
<var> decided to take the newly caught <var> with them!
You all decided to keep pressing forward with your current Pokémon!
You found some Berries lying on the ground!
Your Pokémon ate the Berries, and some of their HP was restored!
Your Pokémon's HP is already full, though, so they don't need these Berries!
You encountered a backpacker!
I can share my supplies with you if you're in need. What item would you like?
<var>
That <var>, eh? Then here you go!
You decided to give your <var> the <var> to hold!
Oh, you don't need anything? Well, good luck with what you've got, then.
You encountered a scientist!
Is your Pokémon feeling a bit worn out from your adventure?
I have a rental Pokémon here that I could swap with someone. I only have one, though.
Are you interested in swapping your current Pokémon for another rental Pokémon?
In that case... <var>! I guess I'll let you borrow my <var> this time!
Keep your chins up, and keep on adventuring!
No one's interested? Then carry on with what you've got, I guess!
The storm seems to have died down a bit...

Everyone will take turns choosing which Pokémon they'd like to take with them.
You can have your Pokémon hold one item!
One Trainer can choose to put the Pokémon from the last battle on their team.
You're still new to Dynamax Adventures, so we suggest trying them alone for now— just to get a little familiar with the rules before you invite some friends to join you!
