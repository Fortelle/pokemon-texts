A treasure lies buried somewhere in Turffield...
According to this treasure map, the trick to finding the treasure lies in the standing stones. "Seek yourself three standing stones, with Grass before the other ones. Use well that strength, and find then the strength of its strength in the end. Dally not, if you've a mind To find what time has left behind." ...That's what it says, but I can't make heads or tails of it!
