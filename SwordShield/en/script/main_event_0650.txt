Hey there, Gym Challenger! Shall we start the process to get you ready for the Gym mission?
Let's do it!
Please wait
Understood! Please come back whenever you're ready.
That's right! You'll have to change into your uniform. The changing room is located over there.
All right, you're in your uniform! Head on in to the Gym mission! Ah, by the way, while you're on the Gym mission, you can't use your Pok√©mon Box Link.
Ah, well, you see...Leader Nessa is actually out by the lighthouse right now. Would you mind going to get her? The lighthouse is toward the ocean, after you exit the stadium.
Ah, the Gym mission, right? Don't give up! My favorite saying is "the persistent raindrops will carve through stone"!

Challenger <var> has already cleared the Gym mission, and will now face Gym Leader Nessa!
Understood! We will eagerly await your return to challenge the Gym again.
