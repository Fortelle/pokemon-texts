Hahaha! Have a look at you, <var>! That old Bag looks like it could pull you over! At least we know that it should hold anything Lee might bring, even if it's as big as a Snorlax!
A Wooloo... But what's it doing there?
Hey! You silly Wooloo! I see what you're up to! Don't go using Tackle on the fencing!
Now, you listen! No going past that fence! No! Everyone knows there are scary Pok√©mon living in the Slumbering Weald!
Meeeh?
Now that that's taken care of... How about it, <var>? Let's race! Bet I can make it to my house first, what with you lugging about that big old Bag!
