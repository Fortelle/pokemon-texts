When you touch clear, clean sand... it can help cleanse your memories of the toil you've been through.
If you want to clear away all of a Pokémon's base points and start with a clean slate, I can help. Give me <var> pieces of Armorite Ore, and I'll cast the spell of sand on a Pokémon you choose.
You don't have enough pieces of Armorite Ore... You can get them by doing Max Raid Battles on the Isle of Armor. Maybe gather them that way?
Which Pokémon do you want me to give a clear, clean slate?
So you want me to give <var> a clean slate?
In that case, let me cast the spell of sand...
Clean...clean...clear, clean sand... Help me make a clear, clean slate!
All the base points of <var> have been cleared away!
Everything's clear... Clear and clean... Come back anytime. Lady Clear will always be waiting for you.
If you ever feel like you need a clean slate, I'll be waiting for you.
That Pokémon's already a blank slate. I don't need to cast my magic.
