Fa fa fa fa fabua!
Hello there! Welcome to Bob's Your Uncle! You're not leaving here without enjoying a delicious meal first!
Isn't this a nice tapestry? I bought it at the antique market.
You must have a proper meal first if you want to have a proper battle!
The food here is out of this world. It's worth coming here just for this, even if it means going out of your way!
Talking about work during a meal? What are you trying to do? Ruin your own food?
This dish is cooked to perfection! It's juicy but not overly soft, and gives you something to really bite into! I must send the cook my compliments!
I absolutely adore watching my child eat. He looks so happy and content!
The food here really is a treat, though. I wish I could figure out how to make it at home so that my Pok√©mon could enjoy it with us!
It's one of the tapestries... It shows the two heroes, but without the sword and shield...
Is it a tapestry...? It looks vaguely familiar.
It's a portrait of the owner, Bob! It's the face of a man who strives to cook things to perfection!
