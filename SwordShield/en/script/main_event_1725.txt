Sis. You shouldn't be forcin' your way in here.
Sorry, <var>!
I thought my bro could get revenge for me, but he lost to Raihan.
You looked so sloppy out there that people are gonna think we're both weak 'cause we're related!
You got it wrong, Sis. Raihan's just that strong. But I was able to show everyone in the audience how amazin' a proper battle without usin' Dynamax can be.
All right, I get it! But that's exactly why I wanted you to win! I still thought it was a brilliant battle, though...
I'm countin' on you to win, <var>. Got that? I'll be cheerin' for you.
Sorry to come in for a chin-wag just before the final match. Raihan's waiting for you on the pitch. We're lookin' forward to a right good battle.
