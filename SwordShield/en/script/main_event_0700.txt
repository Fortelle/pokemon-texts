All right, mate! You've got both the Grass Badge and the Water Badge by now, right? In that case, we're both headed for Motostoke and the Fire Gym Leader, Kabu!
How about I share with you a little tip about that Leader Kabu? From what I heard, he's holed up now in Galar Mine No. 2, undergoing some special training!
If he's in there, then we can't take him on in Motostoke even if we zip right over thereâ€” putting the brakes on our Gym Challenge. So I say we head to Galar Mine No. 2 ourselves! Let's go see what all the fuss is about!
