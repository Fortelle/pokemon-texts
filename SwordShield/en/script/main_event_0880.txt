<var>! Seems you're doing well collecting Gym Badges.
But Hop... Did something happen with him? He was acting really odd when I ran into him. He took one look at me and immediately was like, "I'm so sorry, Lee!" It might be the first time I've heard him apologize for anything, and I've no idea what it was for!
Maybe he's feeling down because he's had some hard losses in battle?
He lost to that Challenger Bede
I think so
When you lose, you feel down in the dumps. But then there's nowhere left to go but back up! You've got to think on why it was you lost, though. You know, that little brother of mine...I think he might yet become a surprisingly great Trainer!
At least I've got you to keep an eye on him. You will look out for Hop, won't you? As his rival.
Blast, and look at the time! Nearly forgot my meeting with the chairman. That Oleana really lets me hear it when I'm late! Now if only I could remember which way to go...
Anyway, I'd say that you should go and say hello to Raihan while you're here, <var>. He's the greatest rival I've got and the final hurdle you'll have to face in the Gym Challenge. He should still be around the vault, if you hurry. It's down that wayâ€”on the way to Route 6.
