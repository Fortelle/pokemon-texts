Huh? <var> and Hop? Ah! I completely forgot about the Championship Match! What're you two doing here?
Haven't you been watching the news at all? The tournament is off, Sonia! The chairman saw to that—and to sending the entire region into a state of havoc!
Huh? What?! What happened while I was researching things in the Slumbering Weald?
Well, for starters, there's a great black storm or something raging over Hammerlocke Stadium. What're they calling it? "The Darkest Day"? It's thrown everything into disarray!
Still, I'm sure we don't need to worry too much... The unbeatable Champion will be able to take care of everything, won't he?
Hold on a tick, ma'am. Did you say "the Darkest Day"?
"The Darkest Day" is the name for the black storm that nearly brought the Galar region to ruin in ancient times...
So, what're you here for, <var>?
I'm here to stop the Darkest Day!
To search for the sword Pokémon
To search for the shield Pokémon
To stop the Darkest Day... You mean you're going to search for the sword and shield Pokémon?
I suppose if the legends are true, then the sword and shield Pokémon should be able to prevent the Darkest Day from coming to pass... They may be just what we need to beat back the black storm!
OK! Here, take this. You should head to the Slumbering Weald. I'll catch up with you once I'm done looking into something that's been bothering me.
I've got to keep looking into the origin of the sword and shield Pokémon!
All that matters is that you do what you can. You've become a fine Pokémon Trainer, after all!
