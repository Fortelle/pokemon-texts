All right, <var>!
You and I both know I've got to keep on trying different strategies if I'm gonna get strong enough to catch up to Lee... No! Not just catch up! If I want to surpass him!
So I think you know what's coming, mate... Let me try out my latest in a battle against you!
Before we ever started out on this journey... I remember watching Lee on the telly. He was like a bright star, so strong I could hardly bear to look right at him.
But now, I can tell just how strong he really is... And what he's got that I haven't...
But I'm getting stronger, too. Maybe not as fast as you, but fine. Whatever! Thanks for letting me battle with you again. And here. I'll heal up your team for you, too!
I think I know what it is I really want... I want to battle Leeâ€”I want to take on my bro. But not just that, I want to beat him! I want to be the one who beats the unbeatable Champion! And I'm going to!
My mind's made up! You and me are going to have another battle once I get my Gym Badge in Circhester!
