I'm training so that I can become huge too and help defeat Dynamax Pokémon.
I can do jobs that Pokémon can't do! For example... Uh, I don't know... But I'm sure there's something I could do!
Well, you see, we depend entirely on Pokémon that come to us for the Poké Jobs at our hotel.
Palpitoad, you've had too much to eat! Are you OK?
Gleh bleeeeeeh...
So many people in the city! I got lost, but thank goodness for the Flying Taxi!
Even if you get lost, it's fun to reach your destination by using the Town Map!
Che che bi.
Sluff fluff.
