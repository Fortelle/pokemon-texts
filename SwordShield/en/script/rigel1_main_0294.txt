Tili...
Look! It's a Petilil!
Petilil evolves into Lilligant, which is just the Pokémon we're looking for!
Peh...
Hey, doesn't that Petilil seem to be acting a bit strange?
It looks sort of sad
It looks a bit lost
Yeah, now that you mention it...
It's still pretty little... Maybe it got separated from its parents?
Tilili!
Whoa! Who're you glomming onto, mate?! You really must be lost if you think I'm your mum!
And now I'm stuck. OK...
You've gotta help us out here, <var>!
Go find us one of Petilil's parents or something, would you? Look for some worried-looking Lilligant!
I'll wait here with this little one. I'm afraid I'll step on it if I start walking around!
Lilligant is a Pokémon that's got this big flower blooming on its head. You can't miss it! And we wanted to find one anyway, right? We're catching two Rookidee with one ball!
Peh...
