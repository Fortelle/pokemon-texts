If you weave together Galarica Twigs, you can make a bracelet.
If you give me <var> Galarica Twigs, I'll weave a Galarica Cuff for you. Do you want one?
Really? It's super cute, though.
You don't have enough Galarica Twigs. Why don't you walk around the Isle of Armor and get more twigs?
Okie dokie. Leave it to me.
Weaving, weaving... Weaving, weaving...
Here it is! Freshly made, just for you!
It'd look very nice on Slowpoke. If you want more cuffs, please bring more Galarica Twigs.
Oh! You have Slowpoke on your team! You like Slowpoke, don't you? In that case, you might like this shirt, too!
Oh! You have Slowpoke on your team! Slowpoke in other regions are zoned out and adorable, too, aren't they?
Oh, it's Slowbro! You gave the Galarica Cuff to your Slowpoke! In that case, you can have this shirt, too!
Oh, it's Slowbro! I heard that Slowpoke in other regions can evolve into Slowbro without a Galarica Cuff.
The design of the zoned-out Pok√©mon is perfect for loungewear.
You got <var> <var>!
