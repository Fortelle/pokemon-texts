Psst. Hey, you. You heard the rumor?
I have
I haven't
Y-you have, huh? I mean, I don't really care or anything...
What? You haven't heard?!
There's a rumor that if you give the one you like an Applin, you'll be together forever!
Actually, the truth is, there's someone I like.
She's gonna move overseas pretty soon...
I've been searching for an Applin so I can get my feelings across the right way. But I can't find one...
If you've got an Applin, would you please give it to me?
Oh, OK... Sorry to ask for something so weird. Guess I'll look a little more on my own.
Whoa! You mean you'll really give me an Applin?
<var> handed over Applin!
Wow! I did it! I finally got an Applin!
Thank you! Thank you so much!
Since you went through the trouble of giving me an Applin...
I've got to tell her how I feel!
Sorry I'm late. What was it that you needed to talk about so suddenly?
I... Err... H-how's your packing going?
Pretty much everything's been packed.
Since I'm moving away tomorrow...
Yeah...
H-hey! Check out this Pokémon!
Oh, an Applin! Amazing! Did you catch it?
W-well...
N-no. Someone gave it to me.
I'm sorry! I really wanted to give you an Applin that I caught on my own! But, well...
Ah, just forget it! I can't give you this Applin.
You're right. I can't take it.
Yeah...
Even if we're separated and far away from each other...
I'll still be waiting...for an Applin you caught yourself.
Wait—do you mean...?
Ah, um... I'll, uh—I'll see you later!
Say, what do you think that was about, just now? Do you think it meant that...?
Good on you!
Congratulations!
Th-thank you?
Wait! Does that mean what I think it means?!
Really, really?! I can't believe it! Woo-hoo!
Ah, sorry! I just never thought that we both felt the same way.
Right, well, I'd better give this Pokémon back to you.
You got back your Applin!
Here, take this, too. Think of it as a reward for helping me take that first step.
I'm going to catch an Applin all by myself!
And then, someday, I'm going to go give her that Applin!
Yeah! I'd better get searching for an Applin!
Thanks again, mate. See ya!
Uh... I appreciate you wanting to help me out, but maybe you should make sure you actually have an Applin?
