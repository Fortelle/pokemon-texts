Hello, hello, Wedgehurst! Your Champion, Leon, is back! I promise I'll keep doing my best to deliver the greatest battles for you all to watch!
It's our unbeatable Champion! Leon, you and Charizard are the greatest!
Well, thank you for that! I hope you'll all carry on training up your Pokémon and never shy from battle. Then come challenge me for the Champion title!
We're on it! We've all been working on our battle skills just like you've taught us to, Lee!
But that Charizard of yours is too strong for the likes of us to take on!
Too true that Charizard is blazingly strong. But other Pokémon can be strong as well! That's why I want the strongest of challengers to fill the Gym Challenge and come battle me!
My wish is for Galar's Trainers to work together to become the strongest in all the world!
Graaawrrr!
Lee!
Hop!
So, my number-one fan in all the world has come out of his way to pick me up!
Look at you, Hop! I reckon you've grown...exactly an inch and a quarter since the last time I saw you!
Bingo! That's the sort of sharp eye that's kept you undefeated so long, eh, Lee?
And these bright eyes over here... I've got it! You must be <var>—am I right? I've heard loads about you from my little brother.
I'm the Galar region's greatest-ever Pokémon Champion—and a massive Charizard fan, too. People call me the unbeatable Leon!
Come on, Lee! And you, <var>! Bet I can beat the both of you back home!
That Hop... Always wanting to be the best, isn't he? With a proper rival of his own, I bet he'd push himself to become something truly special...
Well, everyone! I bid you farewell for today! But don't you fret... I'll always be around to make sure everyone in Galar can have a champion time!
