Uhhh, Challenger <var>, right? Out givin' it your all, even this late, huh?
I'm doin' some visualization trainin'. My battle with Kabu's tomorrow. So, I thought if I came here and had a look at the stadium, I'd get some ideas for a strategy.
Just 'cause you were chosen by the Champion, doesn't mean I'm gonna lose to you! In fact, I'll keep winnin', and I'll have a proper go at the Champion, got it?
See ya around!
