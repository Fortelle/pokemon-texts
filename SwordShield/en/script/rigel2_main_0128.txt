Have you found the carrots, human child?
By the stars!
You say that you have Carrot Seeds? That strange bag contains the seeds of carrots?
You humans never stop adapting and evolving. I am constantly amazed by your ingenuity.
And yet... Hmm. The fields of the village simply won't do. They're not suited for growing carrots.
If we could find rich soil, I could use my powers to grow the crops we need!
Now...where might we find soil suited for growing these crops in this tundra of mine?
Ah, I see two spots that might suit our needs. One is a field covered in pristine snow.
Another spot is a field by gravestones, where those who moved on were laid to rest.
Either of those locations should allow me to use my powers and grow the carrots we need.
Please, I ask that you choose a field and plant those seeds!
*snort* Gah?!
What in theâ€”? I seem to be gettin' in the habit of fallin' asleep outside!
Gahaha! I guess it just goes to show that holdin' down the fort isn't all that easy!
You take care o' yourself, Chief. Don't overdo it!
You marked the two fields Calyrex told you about on your Town Map!
