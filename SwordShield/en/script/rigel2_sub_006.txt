Oh? Something is written on the door. "Walk together with a living crystal of snow."
Something changed in the air...
An icy power is emanating from the Pokémon statue... Do you want to check it out?
Jakiih!
Regice stopped moving again.
The door is shut tight!
The huge Pokémon statue is looking down at you.
Better report back to Chief Peony!
*beep beep beep*
Oi oi! Peony here! Enjoyin' your adventures?
Come again? You've gone and met the ice giant, Regice?!
Gahaha! Smashin' work, Chief! Now, crack on with those other giants! Keep up the good work!
