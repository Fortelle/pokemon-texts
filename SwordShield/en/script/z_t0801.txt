Even a run-down place like this is important for the people and Pokémon who live here.
I won't quit Team Yell! I'll keep cheerin' for Marnie!
I'm a huge fan of Piers. I'd really fancy seeing him in more matches.
At the end of the day, this place'd be more lively if there were more Gym Challengers.
Speaking of Piers, he refuses to Dynamax his Pokémon! But the chairman tried to move the Gym to a kinda faraway place near a Power Spot.
Closing the shutter to sabotage the other challengers was right poor sportsmanship.
Pokémon've got to work hard for a Gym Trainer like me to do well. Cheers, mates!
Heheheee!

Zigzig.
Hissssss!

Piers, go fight!
Man, Chairman Rose is the best.
Piers is so cool!
This is Marnie's time. I know it.
HShe defeated Piers. HShe's somethin'.
I want to cheer a lot more!
Gym Challengers make this place lively!
I liked Piers as the leader.





I love you. I'm sendin' cheers to you. ♪
