We came all the way out to this big city so that we could properly cheer on Gym Challengers! Team Yell is here to help, after all! You're in for a battle if you wanna stop us!
I'm up for that!
Sorry to bother you
Didn't we tell you, mate? You get in our way, and you're in for a battle! Team Yell's all about helpin'... Helpin' one very special Trainer win the Gym Challenge, that is! We wanna make sure she gets cheered on nice and proper... And now you're gonna help us make some noise!
Oi, gimme a break here! Team Yell! Get revenge for me, wouldja?
Course I've got you covered, mate! What could be better than a battle in a lovely hotel lobby?
Ah man! The swanky, sophisticated air in here had me off my game! I couldn't keep my cool!
I wasn't expecting checking in would be such a big fuss, <var>! What's going on? Sneaking in some Pokémon battles without me?
Don't think you can get ahead of me that easily... I need to get some training in, so I'm joining! Here, I'll even heal up your Pokémon, too.
I'm Hop, one of this year's Gym Challengers! And the one who's gonna be the next Champion! Now let's have us a nice two-on-two!
I can already hear my victory comin'! The only sound you'll make is a whimper of defeat!
Guess it was defeat that I heard comin'... I think I'm about to cry...
What are you lot doin' here?
Marnie?!
N-n-nothin'... We was just...
I know you all are terribly curious 'bout the other Gym Challengers, but you gotta show a bit of restraint.
Sorry 'bout them! They're just a bunch of my fans. Call themselves Team Yell and follow me around, cheerin' for me. I think they've let it all go to their heads a bit...
Come on, you lot! Back home with you now!
They're just so caught up with wantin' to support me and all that they tend to get a bit shirty with other Gym Challengers. Sorry if they caused you any trouble.
So you're a Gym Challenger, too? Team Yell, was it? Pretty impressive that you already have a set of fans to call your own!
