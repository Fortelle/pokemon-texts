Aha, there you are!
Hm... You're the traveler I'm supposed to guide, am I right?
Right on time, too! You're pretty punctual for a kid!
Exactly when we agreed to meet, too. Quite the commendable punctuality.
Hmmm... Hey, have we met before or something? Oh, it doesn't really matter, I guess!
Hm? I've got the strangest feeling we've met before... But I can't recall. And here I thought Amnesia was Slowpoke's move.
I'm Klara! I've been at the dojo awhile, so they sent me to help out the newbie!
My name is Avery. I'm a senior member of the dojo you are to join.
What dojo?
I think you've got the wrong person...
Oh, come on! I know you're the new student who's supposed to join the Master Dojo!
You're here to join the Master Dojo, are you not? I also train there.
What's going on? Am I being mocked...by a kid?! But I'm the colorful, caring, and charismatic Klara!
My goodness, this is a thick one. Like a poor, lost Wooloo... It's up to me—as an elegant adult—to make sure they get the message.
Well then... How about we have a quick battle? Just so, y'know, we can see who's better?
Perhaps a show of strength is the best way to get to know each other.
I'll be waiting outside, so come on out when you're ready!
I'll await you outside. Once you're ready, come out to face me.
HShe'll never know what hit himer...
Time to show himer who the better Trainer is...
I'm supposed to join the dojo on this island today, but... there's a strange person standing outside the station, and I'm a bit scared to head out...
Was that a person from the dojo? ...Maybe I'll pass on joining. Hey, why don't you join instead?
