Nan! Nanny!
Sing that song about the king's steed Pokémon!
Oh, of course, my dear. I'd love to.
Iceroot Carrots, cold as ice. ♪ Munched all up by the bully in white. ♪
Shaderoot Carrots, dark as doom. ♪ Crunched by the bully with a ghostly gloom. ♪
Now you make sure you eat your veggies too, just like the Pokémon in the song!
Yes, Nan!
