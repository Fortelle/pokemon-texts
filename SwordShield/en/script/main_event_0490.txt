Standing there on the pitch...in the stadium... in front of everyone! There's really no words for it, but... I can barely contain myself! My heart's racing!


You've made it at last, Hop. And you, too, <var>!
So you're the two Trainers our Champion endorsed himself! Welcome, and it's a delight to meet you! I'm Rose, of course.
Oh, and what's this?! I see you both already possess Dynamax Bands! How wonderful! It seems you two have been led here by the guiding light of the Wishing Stars. By the way, it was my wonderful company that invented those Dynamax Bands, you know!
I daresay this year's Gym Challenge is looking to be an absolute blast! Very good—very good indeed! That means the whole Galar region is in for some excitement!






The Gym Challenge is an excellent opportunity to show off your Dynamax Pokémon! Now, I'm terribly sorry, but there is some urgent business I need to attend to, so I must be on my way. The best of luck to both of you!
The chairman certainly seems to be in high spirits! Now, listen closely, you two. You've both only just started on your path as Trainers. If you want to win, you need to do more than just train your Pokémon. You need to train yourselves, too.
Let's do it, <var>! You know the Gym Challenge has a set order that you've gotta visit the Gyms in, right? The first is in Turffield! And to get there, we need to head to Route 3!
