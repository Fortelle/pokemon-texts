Allow me to explain the Gym mission for Stow-on-Side's Gym!
Please do
No, thanks
To complete the mission, you'll need to ride in one of these cups and make your way to the goal while trying to avoid obstacles!
Let me tell you a bit more about how to operate this fun attraction. Rotate your control stick to the right and the cup will start to spin to the right. Rotate it to the left to make the cup spin left!
If you hit a wall, rotate the stick as quick as you can to get yourself out of that sticky situation! Now, have a good time watching the world spin as you try to reach the goal!
Then on you spin! And good luck!
Did you need something?
What was the mission?
I want to withdraw
I'm good
Use the control stick to spin your cup, and make your way to the goal!
If you withdraw, you'll have to start over the next time you give the mission a try. So, are you sure?
Then I look forward to your next attempt!

Smashing job clearing that Gym mission, Challenger <var>! Would you like to carry on to challenge the Gym Leader at once?


Very good! Then on you go! The Gym Leader is one obstacle you can't avoid!
Naturally, you must want to jot down a report of your progress and ready yourself. I understand!
Gym mission start!
Goal! Gym mission cleared!
