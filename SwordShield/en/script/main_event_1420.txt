The long Gym Challenge is nearing its end, I see. Are you ready to face Hammerlocke Gym and its leader, the dragon user Raihan?
You bet I am!
Maybe another time...
You must remember that she who dares, wins.
In that case, please use the changing room to change into your uniform.
That uniform you wear is a symbol of all of your victories. I feel your determination. Now, head to where all the Gym Trainers await... No, not the stadium, but the vault!
Ah, one moment! You need at least two battle-ready Pok√©mon to face Raihan!
The Gym mission, right? Together with your partner, you can't lose!
That uniform fits you to a tee! Head on in, number <var>!
Hold on there! If you want to face Raihan, you first need to gather seven Gym Badges. Only then will Raihan even think about letting you face him!
