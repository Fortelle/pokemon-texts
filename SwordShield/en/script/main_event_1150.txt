Hold on now.
I've got a few errands to run in Hammerlocke. Care to join me for the journey? If you're headed for the next Gym Stadium, you'll need to get to Hammerlocke, too, after all.
With pleasure!
I'll find my own way
They say two's company, after all.
I like that attitude, child. Still, you're in the middle of the Gym Challenge, are you not? You'll need to head back to Hammerlocke either way if you want to get to Circhester.
