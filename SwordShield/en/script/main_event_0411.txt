So, brilliant young Trainer who's braved the Wild Area! Do you remember what your goal in Motostoke is?
I'm here for the Gym Challenge!
Uhhh...
Yup! The Gym Challenge opening ceremony.
What? You seriously forgot about the Gym Challenge opening ceremony?
By the way, the ceremony tomorrow is being held at the Motostoke Stadium, OK?
Use that lift over there to get to the stadium, 'K?
Well, laters! I'm going to swing by the shops while I'm here, but don't forget to register at the stadium, 'K?
