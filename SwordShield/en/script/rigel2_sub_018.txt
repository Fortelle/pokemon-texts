Mmpoi.
I believe that is the Pokémon known as Poipole.
I found it a little while ago deep within the Max Lair, but...
the more I study it, the more questions I have. It's such a strange Pokémon.
I believe it might have something to do with the current situation we're in.
I really need to buckle down and focus on my research of the Max Lair!
But Poipole keeps trying to wander off as soon as I take my eyes off it.
I'd like a skilled Trainer to accept Poipole and take care of it for me. You wouldn't happen to be interested, would you, <var>?
I am convinced that the only one who could handle Poipole is you, <var>. What do you say?
Hmm... Well, that's too bad. Let me know if you change your mind!
Thank you so much! In that case, I leave Poipole in your capable hands!
Poi polol!
