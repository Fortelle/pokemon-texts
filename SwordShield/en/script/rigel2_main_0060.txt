Oiii...
Wait, lad! Don't go! Did you find my Nia? Did you?!
Wait, lass! Don't go! Did you find my Nia? Did you?!
The poor gentleman has been injured. After much kicking and screaming, I've brought him back here.
Agh! It hurts! It ultra-mega-hurts! Nia! Where's my darlin' Niaaa?
What happened?
Are you all right?
This fine gentleman appears to have tripped on a rock and struck his head.
Hnngh... Adventures aren't to be taken lightly. I've learned that firsthead now— Firsthand, I mean.
I was just checkin' to see if my little girl was behind some rocks, and look how I've ended up!
Behind some rocks? Is your daughter a Rolycoly, sir?
There we go—I'm up! No little bump's gonna keep me down long. That kip's got me feelin' right as rain!
How about it then, lad? Did you find my darlin' Nia?
How about it then, lass? Did you find my darlin' Nia?
I did, but...
Well, here's how it went...
Hmmm... You don't say.
So dear Nia's set on stayin' away till she's had her fill of this Dynamax Adventure stuff...
and she wants the two of us to go ahead and get crackin' on the grand Peony Adven-tour?
You know, I burned the candle at both ends working out the best itinerary I could for my dear Nia's sake...
But I guess she's at that age when she doesn't want her old man taggin' along all the time.
And tryin' to press her into doin' what I wanna do probably won't win me any "dad of the year" awards.
Right, then! What's your name, kid?
Cheers, <var>! My name's Peony! Wait—have I already told you so? Gahaha! Then it's twice as nice to meet you!
Let's have ourselves such a smashin' adventure that my dear Nia'll be itchin' to join in the fun!
Yes, let's!
Erm...
Now that's an ultra-mega-great response! Just what I was hopin' to hear! Gahaha!
Gahaha! Don't fret, now! I've done all sorts of preparations already!
We're goin' to have ourselves a real treat of a Legendary Pokémon hunt!
So that's decided! Now then, <var>!
Let's get ourselves to Freezington! It's a town just a short ways off. Time for a strategic plannin' meetin' for Peony's Adven-tour!
I'll fill you in on the details once you get there! I say, let us reconvene posthaste!
Ha! Just pullin' your leg. Can you imagine if I actually talked like that?
Gahaaahahaha!
What a...unique fellow. Uniquely boisterous to be sure.
Please do hurry and meet your friend in Freezington as he asked... before he decides to come back.
