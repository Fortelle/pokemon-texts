Well, if it isn't <var> and Hop! It's a real shame, the way things have turned out. You make it all the way to the Championship Match, then something like this has to happen!
And Chairman Rose thinking that the energy pouring from the Darkest Day would somehow be the key to saving Galar's future? It all seems a bit mad, if you ask me... I can't follow at all how that's supposed to work.
Well, I don't care if I'm up against the Darkest Day or the chairman or whatever! I'm going ahead! I'm off to help my brother!
And he's gone... That Hop never changes. Always in a rush about something, isn't he?
The key thing is that no one's been harmed. We Gym Leaders worked together with the city's Pok√©mon, and we've got everyone evacuated.
And you, you're fixing to help our Champion? To save everyone in the Galar region?
Of course I am
That's where I'm going now!
Our greatest-ever Champion and the greatest- ever challenger, along with hiser fiercest rival... all teaming up against the Darkest Day... I almost feel sorry for it!
Go on then, our great challenger! Into Hammerlocke Stadium with you!
