I am a world-renowned designer of fashion!
Ah, it's you! I am in your debt for your assistance back on the Isle of Armor.
I remember you!
Wait—who are you?
Your prodigious memory is matched only by your generosity! Indubitably!
Don't pretend you've gone "one, two, and ta-da" and forgotten! You bought the ensemble I designed!
I received quite a shock after we went our separate ways, what?
I'd gone to all the trouble of designing Leon- themed clothes to capitalize on his fame...
only to find he was no longer Champion! Bah!
Thanks to this blasted new Champion, my clothes haven't sold one jot! So as a token of my gratitude for your help, I will bestow some of my unsold stock upon you!
You got <var> ensemble containing <var> and <var>!
I have not abandoned my dreams of achieving true grandiosity!
My next number will become truly grand! And I shall be a wealthy gentleman indeed!
Have you anything that could provide some grandiose inspiration? A giant of local legend, for example!
J-just a moment! That Pokémon you have there...
Is that one of the legendary giants of the Crown Tundra?!
Hmmm. I say, that is jolly good, but I'd rather like to see something a touch more...modern! Have another go! Chin up, what!
It's Regidrago! Smashing! Not only is it a giant of legend, but it looks like it packs a ferocious roar... How altogether novel!
It's Regieleki! Smashing! Not only is it a giant of legend, but it looks like it packs a tremendous jolt... How altogether novel!
My cup runneth over with inspiration!
Aha! Yes! Yes, that's just the ticket!
Behold! A legendary garment infused with the grand and the modern alike!
You got <var> <var>!
I do say, if you come across another giant, kindly show it to me!
A work of staggering genius, indeed! I frighten even myself sometimes.
How could I ever thank you enough?
I say, the inspiration you've provided shall propel me to ever-grander heights of grandiosity!
