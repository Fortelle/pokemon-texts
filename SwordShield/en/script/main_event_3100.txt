Nice timing, you lot!
The stadium's just about reached its limit! There're simply too many Dynamax Pokémon running wild in there!
Seems Wishing Star power is bein' used for some evil purpose.
So that's what's caused all this? That's a problem, all right... But before we get that sorted, we've got to do something about these Dynamax Pokémon!
Glad we've got you all here now. Though we've already done the bulk of the work!
We're here to help, too! Right, <var>?
Leave it to us!
We'll take care of this!
Especially you, Piers! The way you battled me in the Champion Cup... You really had my Dynamax Pokémon up against the wall!
Things might actually go better this time if we split up our little band.
Fantastic! Looks like we've got ourselves together an unbeatable team!
Right! Everyone, split up so we can each take down one of the Dynamax Pokémon! Let's do it!




You guys are the greatest! You really got me out of a tough spot here! I think I'd better snap a quick one to remember this victory by.
I'll take care of the Pokémon that went wild. No need for you all to worry about that.
<var>! Give me a ring if things should go to pot again.
I'm always happy to lend a hand if I can. The great Raihan is here for you anytime!
And Piers! You and I have got to battle again. This time, no Dynamaxing for either of us!
Wishing Stars being used for evil... I assume you all are already looking into who's behind it, right? Carry on, then. I'll take care of things here at Hammerlocke Stadium!
