Wait up, <var>! I'm coming, too! I had Raihan beat in no time! Once I got my head on straight and stopped doubting every decision I made, that is... Heh!
And you never stopped nattering on through the entire battle... You're pretty different from the Champion in that!
But your strength is genuine, as proven by the Dragon Badge you won from me. You came at me with all the force of a raging storm, and even I was blown away!
Listen up, you two! Battle your way through the Champion Cup tournament to face Leon! One of you ought to!
I reckon I'm still the favorite to win, but I'm up against my true rival, <var>... So I'll wring out every last thing I learned during my battle with you, Raihan, to beat himer!
So get a move on, <var>! The train's waiting!
