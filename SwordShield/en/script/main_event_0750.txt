The next morning...
Mornin', <var>.
That friend of yours already went off to challenge the next Gym. Kabu's League Card is supposed to help against him, but I ended up with a few copies, so I'll give you one. Don't look so chuffed. It's no big deal.
Hey, help with somethin' for a sec. I want t'see if I'm ready for the next leg of the Gym Challenge.
Hmm... Looks like I'll need to raise Morpeko and the others a little more. Not much of a thank-you, but I can heal up your team, at least.
Take this, too... A little somethin' for our battle yesterday.
Bet you'll have no trouble beatin' that "man of fire" Kabu chap, right? Why don'cha get over to Motostoke Stadium and get that Gym Badge already?
Urara!
