There's a cloying smell of thick, rich honey coming from the top of the tree!
Will you shake it?
Vvvvvvvvvrrrrrrrrrnnnnnn!
Wh-what is happening now?!
*beep* *beep* *beep* *beep*
Gyargh?!
Oh bee haiiiiivvv!
Whatever it is that came from the tree sucks you into the Pok√©mon Den!
The aftershocks of the battle caused a strange comb of honey to fall from above!
I sure wasn't expecting a Dynamaxed Vespiquen to come swooping out to attack us!
I was too shocked to even think of joining you in the battle!
That is some seriously sticky honey. I'm sure it's the certain something Urshifu loves!
And it seems like that honey was setting off my Power Spot Detector, too.
The Max Mushrooms and this honey you can find here on the Isle of Armor... they both seem to have some kind of tie to Dynamaxing and Gigantamaxing.
There's tons we don't yet know about it, so there's tons of research just waiting to be done.
Come on! You got the thing you were looking for, so let's head back to the dojo at once!
