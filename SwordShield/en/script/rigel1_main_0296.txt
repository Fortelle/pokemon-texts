App?
There! It's an Applin!
Appawaaay!
Applin! No, wait!
This is rotten... I don't see that Applin anywhere!
But I'm sure it went rolling off this way...
<var>! We've gotta find that Applin!
Huh? Something wrong with that Berry tree?
Piiiiii!
Ouch! The Applin clocked you right on the head!
Awaaaylin!
Augh! It ran off again!
Huh? Uh, <var>? Is your head feeling a bit...moist?
That's gotta be Applin's nectar on you!
It might've given us the slip, but at least we still got what we came for!
But is Applin's nectar sweet enough for Urshifu? Well, like they sayâ€”the proof is in the pudding! Or the Applin! So let's give it a try!
*sluuurp*
Hrmmm... I don't think you'd describe it as sticky exactly... It's more like juice or something...
