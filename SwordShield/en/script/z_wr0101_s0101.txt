The Wild Area is a great spot to train your Pokémon, but that's not all... It's also the perfect place to hone your skills as a Trainer, too!
You'll encounter more-powerful Pokémon the farther you go into the Wild Area. Be careful not to go farther than you can handle!
Time to do some camping! It's even more fun when your mates join you!
Swinuuu.
