Hello there, Leon and <var>! Just letting you know...
I think it's time I brought about the Darkest Day. For the sake of Galar's future, of course!
But I'm in a bit of a pickle. The energy released by the Darkest Day is too much for us to contain.
I'm sorry it's come to this. But it's you who forced my hand, Leon. You refused to listen!
