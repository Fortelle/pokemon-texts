You have my thanks for protecting the village, human child.
Were I at my full power, I could have tamed my steed and regained its loyalty...
But weakened as I am now, the most I could do was influence its will and make it depart.
If only I had the Reins of Unity! They would have allowed me to tame my steed in short order!
We can make a set!
We need a flower!
What's that? We can make a set of reins with mane hair from my loyal steed...and a flower that I can grow?!
A flower... A flower... Yes, but of course!
I had assumed that the humans stopped making the Reins of Unity because they had lost their faith in me...
But it was because I lost the power to grow the material needed!
I have spent far too long holding my misguided assumptions, it seems.
It has been many centuries since I was able to grow a radiant flower. Doing so drains much of my power.
But for whatever reason, a fraction of my power seems to have returned to me just now!
There is only one thing to be done! Let the radiant flower bloom!
Crownus bloomus!
Take this, human child.
*pant pant*
It shames me to admit it, but a whole flower is beyond me right now...
I do not know if that petal will be enough, but I still must ask that you use it to try to create the Reins of Unity.
The descendants of the family who once made the reins for me should still live in the village.
I put my hopes on you, human child...
The Reins of Unity? I feel like the mayor's family used to make a rope called something like that, but that was a while ago...
If you're looking to do some research, why not read through the books at the mayor's house?
You want to make a set of reins? Well, the mayor's pretty good at making things. He even made the village's signature shirt!
Huh? The Reins of Unity? Never heard of 'em.
I've seen you running around, talking to everyone here in this village. You seem pretty friendly!
