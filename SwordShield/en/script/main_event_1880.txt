G-Gym Challenger! You must help me! I-I mean, please, help me!
My Pokémon suddenly Dynamaxed for some reason and started running amok in the stadium...
Raihan...I mean, Mr. Raihan was able to subdue the Dynamax Pokémon in the stadium, but...
If other Pokémon also Dynamax and go on a rampage...
the underground power plant would collapse! Mr. Rose is down there right now!
I know this is selfish of me, but I must beg your assistance! I want you to head into the underground power plant and stop Mr. Rose!
Mr. Rose has awakened a Pokémon known as Eternatus... Apparently, the energy emitted from its body is what causes Dynamaxing.
At this rate, all the Pokémon in the Galar region will Dynamax and go berserk! If that were to happen—
Please, you must save Mr. Rose! You can take the lift over there to reach him. I've enlisted the help of the Champion's younger brother, too, but who knows what is going on...
Oh no... Eternatus is— Oh, Mr. Rose...
