Do you want to pull the carrot out?
One, and two, and...pull!
Well done, human child!
That carrot will be the key to luring my loyal steed back to me.

Now all I need are the Reins of Unity. They will amplify my power, letting me ride my loyal steed with ease.
But I doubt I shall ever get another set from the humans in the village.
Brrriiice!
Sheighhhhd!
What?! Glastrier, my loyal steed! Is it truly you?!
What?! Spectrier, my loyal steed! Is it truly you?!
That glistening white pelt... That rough, violent gallop...
That glossy black pelt... That rough, violent gallop...
It has not changed from the day we first met! Oh, how this brings back memories...
Brrrhm... Brrrferrm...
Shrrrrerrrm... Shrrrerrm...
It is my belief that while my steed picked up on the scent of the carrot, it could not determine where the scent was coming from.
Judging from the direction it ran off in, it must be headed to the village, in an attempt to pillage carrots there!
If that is true, then Freezington is in danger! Human child, we must make haste!
I-I won't let a ruffian like that do anything to my precious fields!
Please help! There's a Pokémon threatening our village!
That Pokémon... Is it the one from the fairy tales?!
A huge Pokémon like that could lay waste to our whole village! Please! Someone! Anyone! Get it to settle down!
Now, I wonder what all that commotion is about. Is it festival season already?
My loyal steed is endangering the villagers! But I am too weak... Please, human child! I beg you! Save the village!
