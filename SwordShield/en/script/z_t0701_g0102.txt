Can you hear me?
Try to feel your way through... Trust your senses...
That's it... That's the ticket...
Take a deep breath. Focus.
It might get a bit harder to see, now...
You have to carry on, not knowing what lies before you.
Feeling nervous yet? Your heart is pounding, isn't it?
No hesitation. Your only choice is forward.
That's a dead end, I'm afraid.
Failure opens your eyes to things you couldn't see before.
Don't let yourself slip up now. Not this close to the end.
You did...wonderfully. Just wonderfully.
Now, Gym Challenger. Join me on the pitch.
Tsk, tsk! No rubbing your eyes!
