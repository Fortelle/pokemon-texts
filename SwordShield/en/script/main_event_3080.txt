Don't get too close, you lot! Things are pretty dangerous here!
We know the situation. Are the staff and spectators all right?
Yes. They took shelter just a short while ago...
Y'know, the more I look at you three, the more I see how odd a little group you are.
Tch. Leave us alone.
We came here to help you out.
And I'm grateful for it. That Dynamax Pokémon's power is so intense I'm sure it'd give me trouble.
I'd feel a lot more confident about it if you all joined the battle.
Let's do it!



Because of everyone's help, no one was hurt and we were able to turn the tide of the situation.
I'll keep that Pokémon at Hulbury Stadium until it can fully recover.
<var>... If you ever need my help, just let me know.
I suppose I'll see you later, then? Thank you so much for your help, truly.
