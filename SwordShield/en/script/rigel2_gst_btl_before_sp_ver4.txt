Oho! I see some familiar faces! Now this reminds me of the Gym Challenge!
Hmph. Can't say that I have too many pleasant memories of that...
C'mon! Let's see who's got the strongest!
Not too long ago, we were seeing you off at the station, and now you're the Champion, eh?
Yeah, I remember sending you off with a good round of cheering at Motostoke!
Time flows like a swift river, doesn't it? I'd rather not think too much about it.
Well now, it's us three good friends and the Champion, all here together!
It's interesting when you think about it. The three of us are weak against each other's types!
Not to mention we already know each other's strategies. This is going to be tricky...
I've been training my legs on the hills of Turffield! Leave it to me to really dig my heels in!
Hey now! I brave the rough waves of Hulbury every day, you know! I'm no pushover!
Oh, um, well... We have that lift in Motostoke?
Well! <var>, my liege! And your spiky-haired follower, I see.
Guess there's no point hopin' the pair of you'll ever lose yer rude streak, huh?
True celebrities change not their attitude, even if they have a change of heart!
You've developed a nice depth to your battle technique, boy.
No need to flatter me, Opal. Compared to you two, I'm just a whippersnapper!
Oh, come off it! You've got the air of a seasoned veteran! Way more than me, actually!
We're taking on Leon? Great. Now my partner'll never shut up...
Raihan always goes all out against me, but you'd better give your best too, Piers!
Leon's mine, Piers! Don't get in my way!
<var> and Piers, huh? That's a fun combination!
I've got my hands full just keepin' up with all of <var>'s shenanigans, really.
Is that so? Well, you'd both better be ready, because I've got some shenanigans of my own!
