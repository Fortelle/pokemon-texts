Get to safety, you three!
Get to safety, you three!
Who d'you think you're talkin' to, then? We're here to help, not be helped.
Oh, actually... I didn't realize who I was talking to.
Oh, it's you three. I was a little too into things and didn't notice right away, I'm afraid.


<var>'s here, so everyone can relax!
I was just thinking over how to handle all the Dynamax Pokémon...
There appear to be no less than four Dynamax Pokémon. I was just going over a plan on how to handle things.
With all of you here, we can each take one of them on!
With all these strong Trainers together, I'm sure we can work something out here!
Let's hurry to the pitch.
Are you all ready, then? Let's head to the pitch!



Nice work, everyone. No one's hurt, are they?
Phew! Is everyone feeling all right?
Hah...hah... Just barely!
Battling a Dynamax Pokémon all on your own is pretty hard work!
Hehe. I expected nothing less from you, <var>. You seem like quite the reliable Trainer, too, Hop.
Ohoho! Of course you had no problem, <var>! You really seem like a reliable Trainer, too, Hop!
I...I do?
Looks like he ain't used to compliments. Look, he's got a grin wider than a Meowth.
I do not! Shut your gob, Piers!
I'll take care of the Pokémon we battled, so there's no need for any of you to worry, all right?
I'll take care of the Pokémon we battled. No need for anyone to worry.
<var>. It's hardly a reward for what you've done for me, but please take a copy of my League Card.
<var>. It's not much of a reward, but have a copy of my League Card.
If anything comes up, please contact me.
Give me a call if anything happens!
All right then. I wish you all the best of luck for the future!
Don't overdo it out there!
