Hammerlocke Stadium shook...
That's where Chairman Rose's power plant is, isn't it?
Huh? A Power Spot?!
What's wrong?
You mean, like where you can Dynamax?
I'm getting readings from the Power Spot Detector... Does that mean Dynamaxing is possible here?
That's right! The Power Spot Detector reacts when it's possible to Dynamax!
Hey, Sonia! And <var>, too! You felt the shaking, right? Seems Chairman Rose is testing something again.





This is bad! Pok√©mon might start Dynamaxing right in the middle of Hammerlocke!
Is that so? I can make sure the chairman knows.
You'll just get lost, Leon. I'm going, too!
I'm really looking forward to seeing you compete in the Finals. So you should leave the investigation on the quaking to the adults. Head to Circhester and get that Gym Badge!
Oh! <var>!
First that forest, then that mad quiz... I've been lost in every sense of the word! But it looks like I've finally caught up to you again.
Come with me to Route 7! I could use a bit of competition to motivate me!
