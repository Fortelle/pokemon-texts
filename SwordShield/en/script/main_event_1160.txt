Hammerlocke—always such a dusty town. Though I suppose some Pokémon prefer it that way.
Didn't we just part ways? I certainly seem to run into you a lot.
Hm? That boy...
Now that's what I would call pink!
Come to gawk at me now that I've had my Challenge Band taken away and my Gym Challenger status revoked? Can you really afford to waste time like this?
Of course!
Not really...
Well, I suppose so. You no longer have to worry about catching up with me, after all.
I commend your humility. It is appropriate for a Trainer of your...limited talents.
I'll have you know, though, that I haven't given up! I must become the Champion in order to help out the chairman! I will go and ask him to let me rejoin the Gym Challenge!
So sincere and straightforward and yet so twisted and misguided... I like it! That's the kind of thing that gives people some depth!
Now, listen. I'll let you attempt my Gym mission, even if you're not a Gym Challenger. In fact, I don't plan on giving you a choice, so don't even think about refusing.
Time for my Gym mission, child!
Huh? Wha—?!
Pink!
Pink!
And pink!
Congratulations, child!
You are most definitely pink.
M-Ms. Opal? What in the world has gotten into you?!
You were used by Oleana—am I right? You worked hard to gather Wishing Stars for her, only to have her throw you away like rubbish once she was done with you...
Come with me, child. I might be able to help you out. Of course, it all depends on how much hard work you're willing to put in, too.
Are you... Are you testing me? Very well, I accept! In fact, I plan on making sure you see my full talents and tell me everything you know about the Wishing Stars!
Farewell for now, child. You should head to Circhester. I take it you know how to get to Route 7.
