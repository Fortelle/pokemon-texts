Welcome, honored Gym Challenger!
I think you already realize, but I'm Nessa. Sorry to have made you look for me.
I don't doubt my humble mission's difficulty... Yet you cleared it. Your mind as a Pokémon Trainer must be quite refined.
No matter what kind of plan your refined mind may be plotting, my partner and I will be sure to sink it.
How...? How can this be?!
*sigh* Now that I've battled you, I think I understand.
Continue to seize victories in the Gym Challenge with your Pokémon. You have an incredible spirit that may even be strong enough to challenge the Champion.
You and your Pokémon are indeed deserving of this Gym Badge.
You can now catch Pokémon of up to Lv. 30!
You'll want to challenge the Fire Gym Leader next. As you and your Pokémon are now, he'll definitely want to battle you.
<var>! My sincere congratulations for your victory over Gym Leader Nessa. Please take this commemorative TM.
Take this, too. It's a replica of Nessa's uniform!
Now that you've won the Water Badge, I'll be watching to see just how far you and your Pokémon can go!
You've defeated the Gym Leader, Nessa! My sincerest congratulations!
Do you want to go back to the reception area?
You decided to return to the reception desk.
