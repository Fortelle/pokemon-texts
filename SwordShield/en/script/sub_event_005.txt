It's a Toxel! A real Toxel! I found an Egg, and carried it around with me— and it hatched into a Toxel! Why don't you raise it? It's a real shocking Pokémon!
Tox tox!
And take these, too! They'll help your Pokémon grow if you use them!
Eggs are found at Pokémon Nurseries! Exp. Candies are found from Max Raid Battles! And you've found yourself a real nice friend today, wouldn't you say?
What?! You can't even take one more Pokémon?! You must really love Pokémon, all right!
