Ladies and gentlemen!
I am Rose, chairman of the Pokémon League!
I know that everyone gathered here...
And everyone watching from home have all been waiting for this big moment!
It is my pleasure to announce that finally— the Galar region Gym Challenge will now begin!
Yes, the Gym Challenge!
Participants must defeat the eight Gym Leaders...
And gather the eight Gym Badges to prove their skills as a Trainer!
Only the most worthy will have the honor of challenging the greatest Champion in history!
Now, I would like to invite the Gym Leaders to show themselves!
