<var>!
This is mad... You know what I mean?
Where's Leon?
What was that loud noise?
That's what I'd like to know! That noise—it was like some massive explosion! There was this huge surge of red light, and then wild Pokémon just started Dynamaxing around me, brazen as you like!
Take a look at the news!
See! There's Lee! He really is the greatest, right?
Lee and his Charizard took down that Dynamax Pokémon in the blink of an eye!
I knew Lee was strong, but this! Really makes you appreciate how great he is, eh? Let's go meet up with him, <var>! He should be at Hammerlocke Stadium!
