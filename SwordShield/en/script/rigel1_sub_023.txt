Hello there, <var>! Care to have a battle with little old me?
Well, just give me a holler when you're in the mood!
Woohoo! That's what I like to hear! Well, there's no time like the present, right? Let's get it started!
Battles with you are always so much fun, <var>! And my Pok√©mon seem happy, too!
Hee hee hee! Seems like I won! You put up quite a fight, too, <var>. Let's do this again!
Remember, part of training is knowing that good work requires good rest afterward. We can have another match tomorrow!
