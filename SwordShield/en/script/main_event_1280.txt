The Hero's Bath... They say this is where the two heroes came to soothe their wounds after the battle to bring down that evil presence, long ago.
Nowadays only Pokémon really use the Hero's Bath, though... Hmm... Who exactly were the heroes that bathed here? I think I'll have to look into that.
You two met a mysterious Pokémon back in the Slumbering Weald... Perhaps...you two can become new heroes.
What, like some hero waving around a sword and shield? Pull the other one. Though...I guess I'd fancy a shield, if I had to take my pick.

What kind of battle do you think the heroes had back then?
Why don't we show her, <var>! Think we can pull off a real heroic battle?
Absolutely!
Give me a minute...
I've been getting stronger and stronger lately! I won't lose to Lee, some hero, or even you, <var>! Come and have a go!
All right, I get it. Prepare as much as you like!
Sonia treated us to a great meal. After that curry, I feel like I've got the energy to wrestle a Bewear!
I don't entirely understand your reasoning, but I might just as well see what you can do. I'll heal up your Pokémon for you, <var>, so give it your best!
Time for a little exhibition match, starring the future Champion!
Thanks! You two gave a right proper battle... At the rate you both are going, even the unbeatable Leon may be in trouble!
So what's next, you two? I plan to look into things in the Slumbering Weald.
I'm going to keep challenging that Gym! Then, once I get that Gym Badge, I'll be heading for Route 9 to take on Spikemuth next.
Seems like he finally shook off that gloom. Leon'd worry if Hop wasn't feeling all right. As his rival, you wouldn't like it either, right? See ya.
