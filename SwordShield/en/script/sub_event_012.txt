Well now, what's this? I see you have a Rotom Phone and a bike... That means you must already know that the Pok√©mon Rotom absolutely loves to jump into all sorts of different motors! If you want to find out how a Rotom enters motors, then try to best my very own Rotom!
You're not interested in Rotom...? Really? Do such people even exist...?
Prepare to be confounded by all the various forms of my dear Rotom!
You defeated every one of my Rotom... You should be able to put this catalog to good use!
If you use the Rotom Catalog, it will let Rotom enter all sorts of home appliances! Oh, and of course, Rotom can get out again.
