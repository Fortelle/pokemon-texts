One last thing before we race, <var>. See, I've got some great advice for you!
You know how you sometimes see Pokémon wandering about out of the tall grass, yeah?
If you move real slow like, and crouch down, those Pokémon won't pay you any notice.
But on the other hand... If you whistle at them, you'll be SURE to catch their attention!
If you're a bit rubbish at whistling, just remember this: "Need a fail-proof trick? Press the Left Stick!"
Try it out, and let's see who can catch the most Pokémon, <var>!
You remember Wedgehurst Station, right? Where we went to pick up Lee before. That'll be the goal, so see you there!
Come on, <var>! You'll never beat me to the station at that pace!
So, out with it, <var>! How many did you catch? I caught a really special one!
And you got... Not one?! What were you doing this whole time? You're going to want a team if you're a Trainer!
And you got yourself... Ooh, just one! Looks like we're at a draw. Though we are rivals and all, so that's fair!
But look at how many you caught! You're well on your way to building a fine team.
That's a technical machine! A TM, mate! With a TM like that, you can teach your Pokémon a new move in a flash. And you can use them again and again, too. That one can teach the move Swift. Lee gave it to me ages ago, and now it's yours.
The Gym Challenge will begin in Motostoke! And our train's waiting, so let's go!
