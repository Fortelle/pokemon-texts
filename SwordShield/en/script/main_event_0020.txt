Hello, hello!
Oh! That your flash new phone, <var>? Were you watching Lee's exhibition match on it? But you can't cheer him on with your hands full! You know the only way to properly cheer on Lee would be with his famous Charizard pose!
Hop! Didn't expect to see you here today, dear. Isn't this the big day?
Yeah, that's exactly why I came running over to get <var>!
Never mind watching the match now! I've got it recording at home anyway. I record all my brother's matches.
Come with me, <var>! He should be here any minute! And Lee always brings presents when he visits, so I wouldn't forget that Bag if I were you!
Now I've got to run! See you at mine later!
What is it, love? Isn't Hop expecting you?
Rushing off in that state, <var>? Didn't Hop say you should bring your Bag? I last saw it in your room. And don't forget to grab a hat for the weather!
You grabbed your dad's old Bag!
You grabbed your mum's old Bag!


Oh, don't you look a treat! I knew that Bag would suit you. Now hurry along. Hop is waiting, isn't he? But rememberâ€”no going into the forest for the two of you!
