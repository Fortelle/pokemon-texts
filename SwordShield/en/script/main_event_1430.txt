Finally, a challenger made it! I've been waiting for someone to battle... Though I've got to admit I didn't think it'd be you!
But I guess I should've expected no less from a Pokémon Trainer that Leon saw promise in.
And you aim to defeat Leon... Do you have any idea just how high a hurdle that is? As his greatest rival, I guess that I—Raihan—will have to show you!
Gym Leader Raihan doesn't simply control the weather. He also seeks two-on-two battles! You must be prepared for any situation against a foe like him!
In the aftermath of the furious battle... I feel as pure and refreshed as when the sky clears after a storm.
What can I possibly say? Calling myself Leon's rival? Seems I'd grown quite conceited for someone who can't even claim the title of Champion! Overconfident in both myself and my team!
I'll give you what you want, then. The proof of your victory—the Dragon Badge!
You can now catch Pokémon of any level!
You've collected all of the Gym Badges from the Galar region!
Now, win your way through the Semifinals and Finals for your chance to challenge Leon! You must! You owe us that much at least, for beating us in battle here today!
You've collected all of the Gym Badges... At last it's time for the Champion Cup! I look forward to seeing how you all do in battle!
Please accept my congratulations on making it through the Gym Challenge!
Do you want to go back to the reception area?
