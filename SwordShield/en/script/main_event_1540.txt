I just had this sort of flashback, you know. Remember? Back when we were still in Postwick.
When we got our Pok√©mon from Lee that day, I never would've dreamed that I'd end up standing here...facing you, of all people.
But it's time I finish what was started that day... Got it? The one who'll become Champion is me!
And the victor of the Semifinals, the challenger who has won their way through all of the many hopeful Trainers in the Gym Challenge is... Challenger <var>!
You know, even when Sonia was saying that you and me looked like we could become heroes, I really never felt like one...
But you, mate! I think maybe you really could do all sorts of great things!
Good on you, <var>! And <var>!
Good on you, <var>! And <var> and all the rest of your team!
