Level with me, <var>. Is this your first time in a Pokémon Center?
Yes...
Of course not
Then I don't think you need me to tell you what you already know.
Then the future Champion's got you covered!
First things first—you talk to the lady at the counter if you want your Pokémon healed up.
And Pokémon you catch are kept in computers like the one you can find here, see? After all, you can only bring six Pokémon with you on the road in your party.
The Potions they sell at the Poké Mart got me out of a real rough spot the other day!
If you two kids are Pokémon Trainers, you might want to buy some Potions before you head out!
Cheers! I'm already good, though. I'm heading to Route 2, <var>! Come find me, maybe, when you're done here!
