The mission given by Turffield's Pokémon Gym is this!
To chase our unruly Wooloo!
To that blockade we've made from our bales of straw over there!
Oh, by the way, you can call me Dan. I serve as a referee, and it's also my job to report the results of battles to the League HQ.
Now, let the Gym mission begin!
Did you need something?
What was the mission?
I want to withdraw
I'm good
Then on with you! And good luck!
Chase after the Wooloo, and gather them by the blockade made of straw bales! If you do, they'll break through the blockade, and you'll be able to carry on ahead.
If you withdraw, you'll have to start over the next time you give the mission a try. So, are you sure?
Then I look forward to your next attempt!
Congratulations on completing the Gym mission, Challenger <var>!
Now you must face the Gym Leader, Milo, in a Pokémon battle!
I hope you'll remember your battle with Milo every time you look at that Grass Badge!
Gym mission start!
Gym mission cleared!
You've cleared the first blockade!
You've cleared the second blockade! Two more to go—you're halfway there!
Would you look at that! Defeating the Trainers seems to have settled that Yamper down, too!
Brilliant! You've made it through three blockades! Just one last obstacle remains!
