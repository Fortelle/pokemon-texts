That was actually kinda sweet.
So you were watchin', Sis... You won't learn anythin' from seein' me lose.
I was watchin' YOUR battle, Bro. It's how I learned to battle an' all that.
That right? That reminds me. Marnie, there's somethin' I wanted to tell you.
I want you to take over the Gym here in Spikemuth as its Gym Leader.
Yeah, I know. You'd planned to retire after the Champion Cup, right?
I think you've really become a great Gym Leader, even if you don't Dynamax your Pokémon.
I love you, but my answer is a big, fat "NO"!
I mean, when I end up becomin' Champion, I won't be able to be a Gym Leader!
Good point. In that case, let your big bro see if you have the skill to be a Champion!
Hey, <var>, thanks for havin' an amazin' Pokémon battle with my brother. It's my turn next! So clear off for a bit, 'K?
