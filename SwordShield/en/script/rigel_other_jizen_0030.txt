If Slowpoke blocks the ticket gate, it'll cause trouble for other customers.
Slowpoke are actually pretty heavy... So, do you think you could catch it for me?
Slooow.
Battle Slowpoke in order to catch it?
Slowww?!

Huh? Slowpoke still hasn't stopped blocking the ticket gate?
Looks like defeating Slowpoke isn't enough. The only way is to catch it!

To catch a Pokémon, you first need to weaken it. Then throw a Poké Ball!
Slo?!
Thanks much! Slowpoke can be a big trouble to move sometimes.
Wow! Amazing!
Hmmm? How interesting...
The way you caught that Slowpoke was the absolute coolest.
I must say, your catching style was quite simply elegant.
We apologize for the wait. We have checked your Armor Pass.
