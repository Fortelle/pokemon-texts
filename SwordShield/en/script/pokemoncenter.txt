Hello, Champ! Welcome to the Pokémon Center. Would you like to rest your Pokémon?
Welcome to the Pokémon Center! Still hard at work today, huh, Champ? Would you like to rest your Pokémon?
I'll take your Pokémon for a few seconds, then.
Thanks for waiting! Your <var> should be all better now!
Thanks for waiting! <var> and the rest of your team should be all better now!
We hope to see you again!
Happy birthday! I hope you'll keep visiting the Pokémon Center for many years to come! Now, would you like to rest your Pokémon?
Oh... It looks like your Pokémon may be infected with the Pokérus. Little is known about the Pokérus, except that it is a microscopic life-form that attaches itself to Pokémon. While infected, Pokémon are said to grow exceptionally well.
Happy birthday, <var>!
I do hope this will be a wonderful year for you. Each and every day!
Oh, today is a special day! I know it's a day early, but happy birthday!
First, let's restore your Pokémon to full health.
Please visit a Pokémon Center whenever your Pokémon's HP is getting low. And if you're planning to go far off the beaten path, you should probably remember to stock up on Potions from the Poké Mart, too. Good luck out there, Trainer!
There! All happy and healthy! Good luck and take care!
Oh, you're back, <var>! Looks like you and your team are tuckered out. You should have a nice rest while you're home. ... ... ... ... ... ...
Now, that's more like it! You and your Pokémon should be all rested and ready for anything! Be sure to take care of your Pokémon when their HP gets low and they're too tired to battle.
I'll heal up your Pokémon!
