Gym Challenger. Would you like to challenge our Gym?
Of course!
Hold on...
Then please change into your uniform in the locker room. This will not be a mission so much as a test of your quality. It is a very serious examination.
That uniform looks good on you. Now relax, clear your mind, and go break a leg.
Goodness... That is a shame. How quick you were to give up.
I hope you enjoy the little examination we call our Gym's mission.
You received a TM from Leader Opal, yes? The next Gym waits for you in Circhester.
The Fairy Badge suits you. Keep up the fine work, Masteriss <var>.
