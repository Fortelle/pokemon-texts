H-hello there... You look like someone I might trust...
You see, there's someone I fancy and I...I... I've written him a love letter!
Do you think you might deliver it for me?
Of course
Certainly not!
Oh, right... Sorry for asking such a strange thing of you...
D-did you change your mind, perhaps? Will you deliver my letter for me?
Oh, thank you! Thank you! I'm so glad I found someone like you to help me!
My name is Paula. Here you are. This is the letter I want you to deliver!
Deliver it to Frank for me, won't you? Frank in Ballonlea. That's who you want.
Please make sure the letter reaches Frank. Frank in Ballonlea. You'll find him, won't you?
Frank? That's my grandda's name.
You're looking for Frank? That'd be me, yes...
What's this? You've got a letter addressed to me?
You handed the Old Letter to the old man.
Now who could be sending me letters? Oh! Why, this says it's from Paula!
That does take me back ages... Paula was the name of a girl I spent all my time playing with when I was a young lad...
She fell ill. Didn't tell me, though. She kept it a secret just how sick she was.
We ended up having a great row about it... Then I moved away not long after that fight. I never met her again after the day I left.
How was she? Did she look well? Dear old Paula...
She looked well
... ... ...
That's a comfort to hear.
What? The quiet type, are you? Meowth got your tongue?
I reckon I ought to give you something for this gift you've brought. For you've brought me back a piece of my youth.
Do you have a dear friend in your life? Make sure you treasure those dear to you while you have them close.
What's this? You found something lying on the ground...
Finding your way through Glimwood Tangle is a fair sight easier if you give the mushrooms a li'l nudge to light them up.
Every time I meet granny Opal, she tells me I should wear more pink, the old bat.
My grandda seems to have a bit more spring in his step lately. Thanks for bringing whatever was in that letter!
Thank you...for delivering the letter...
