Carown craaawn.
Calyrex's full power is too much to withstand! You can't even hold on to your Poké Balls!
You should come back when you're as strong as the Champion...
Do you want to ready your Poké Balls in order to catch Calyrex?
Crowon!
Crmmm...
Crmmm...? Mucrown?
It seems as if Calyrex is testing you...
Human child... No, I should refer to you by your name now. <var>.
I look forward to what adventures we might have together.
*beep beep beep*
Hello? That you, Chief? It's me—Peony!
I just had a dream about a bigheaded Pokémon, talkin' on and on in a weird shrine...
I just remembered I had a dream a while back about a strange bigheaded Pokémon. It was jabberin' away at this weird shrine!
You were there, too, Chief! It all felt so real!
I got worried about you and decided I'd better give you a call and check in!
You haven't hurt yourself, have you, Chief? Not in a bunch of trouble, are you?!
I'm fine!
Everything's under control!
Ah, good to hear! Guess I got nothin' to worry about, then! Gahahaaa!
The Peony Exploration Team is all about the safety and well-bein' of its members, after all!
So you be careful on your way back, too, you hear?
No expedition's over until you're safe and sound back at home base!
Gahaaahaha!
Better report back to Chief Peony!
Our crops are doing exceptionally well recently! The King of Bountiful Harvests certainly is living up to its name!
Have you seen that massive tree to the south of the village?
Is that big man who's staying in the inn someone you know? My goodness but he has a voice to match his size! I nearly fainted when he greeted me!
A young professor's staying at our home. I even got her autograph!
That young professor's gone home. My Beldum is feeling awfully lonely since it doesn't have Yamper to play with anymore...
We'll continue to live here on the Crown Tundra. Even if the king is no longer with us.
Hoho! How're your legendary adventures going?
