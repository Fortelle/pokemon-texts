Our sincerest apologies! The chairman is quite busy at the moment... Everyone, please disperse! Please leave now!
OK. See you later, Chairman. ♪
No need to rush off! I can still do more autographs! I'll even give you my Pokémon League Card!
We need the support of our fans to keep doing what we're doing. Chasing them off like that... Aren't you being a bit too harsh, Oleana?
Fans are very important, of course. That's why you need to keep doing your work— for their sake.
I promise to do everything in my power to assist you, too, Chairman!
Oh, and you were...?
Bede, sir.
That's right! Bede! I daresay I'm impressed how far you've come since I gave you that Pokémon all those years ago.
Will you be the one to win the Gym Challenge? Or perhaps it will be one of the Trainers endorsed by the Champion.
I will prove your faith in me was well placed, Chairman. I won't lose to anyone! Anyway, I will be on my way now.
Ah, your name was...<var>, right? We were just talking about you! I admit I'm curious about Leon's reasons for endorsing you.
Ah! I just had a good idea, as I tend to do!
You're going to face Gym Leader Nessa soon, yes? If you get a Gym Badge from her, I'll hold a celebration. I'd like to get to know you a little better, after all!
Chairman, we should really be going...
Please do your best, for the sake of Galar's future!
The chairman will be heading to this town's seafood restaurant. Win the Gym Badge and join him there at once. Do not keep him waiting.
