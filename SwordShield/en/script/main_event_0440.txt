Hiya! Looks like you both got yourselves registered.
Oh hey, Sonia! What're you doing at our hotel?
I'm researching the mysterious Pokémon that are said to be in the Slumbering Weald. I reckon if I look into some of Galar's legends, I might figure something out. Care to join me? You're here already anyway.
What's this, then?
It's a statue of the hero who once saved the Galar region. I could run through the legend right quick, if you fancy?
The short version, if you please!
Give me all the details!
Long ago...a great black storm covered the Galar region. People called it "the Darkest Day." The land was assaulted by gigantic Pokémon... but they were defeated by a single young hero bearing a sword and shield. This statue here is meant to depict the young hero of that legend.
We still don't understand what kind of sword and shield the hero actually had. And what this "black storm" is supposed to be is just another mystery... Whatever it was, it blotted out the skies all across Galar. I suppose that tracks with it being called the Darkest Day, but still...
Huh... I suppose that hero must've been about as strong as Lee, then! Looks like you're going to have your hands full with plenty to research, though, Sonia. Black storms and swords and shields and all...
You'll be all right, Sonia!
Will you be all right, Sonia?
Heh, thanks! I'll muddle through somehow—don't you worry!
Course I will. I'll muddle through somehow—don't you worry!
You two are staying here at the hotel tonight, though, aren't you? Shouldn't you check in?
Probably so! And we'll look out for you, too, Sonia. If we hear anything about any hero or whatnot, we'll tell you!
I guess we probably should head to the front desk to get checked in.
Thanks for always taggin' along with Hop. I hope you can keep it up. Leon really worries about him, too. He practically raised him, after all.
