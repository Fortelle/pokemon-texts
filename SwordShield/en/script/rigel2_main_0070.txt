Hello, hello! What have we here? Another visitor?
I am the mayor of this fair town of Freezington.
I must say, it's a surprise to have visitors arriving in our out-of-the-way town one after another.
Might you be here to learn about the legend of the King of Bountiful Harvests as well?
Ah, never mind. It hardly bears asking.
After all, there's very little otherwise to attract visitors to our sleepy corner of the region.
Which is a bit of a shame, really...
People come all this way to investigate what turns out to be a mere fairy tale.
But since you've made the journey, I must offer you this Freezington specialty as a memento!
You got <var> <var>!
It's a shirt emblazoned with the likeness of the King of Bountiful Harvests. I'm afraid it hasn't sold quite as well as we'd hoped. We've got a fair number left over...
The illustration's based on extremely ancient accounts of the king's appearance. Hence the unusually sized head.
But we thought it might make the design a touch more "hip," as they say...
If you'd like to see what the king really looked like, I suggest you take a look at the statue by the fields in the center of our village.
By the by, while you're here in the Crown Tundra, feel free to let your lead Pok√©mon out of its ball and take it for a stroll.
Farewell for now, then.
Oi!
Over here, <var>!
