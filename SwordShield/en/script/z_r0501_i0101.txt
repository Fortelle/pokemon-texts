Oh? Welcome. Is there anything you'd like to know about?
Is there anything else you'd like to know about?
Here at the Pokémon Nursery, we take care of the Pokémon that Trainers leave with us. The Pokémon we look after won't get strong, but if you leave two Pokémon with us, we sometimes find Pokémon Eggs. If you want to leave your Pokémon with us, please speak to my granddaughter outside.
If you put a Pokémon Egg in your party and carry it around, a Pokémon will hatch from the Egg. Nobody knows where Pokémon Eggs come from. They truly are mysterious...
If you want to find Pokémon Eggs, think about the two Pokémon you leave here. I recommend you leave two of the same species of Pokémon with different genders. If the species are similar, we may still find a Pokémon Egg. But it seems we never find Eggs with certain combinations of Pokémon left here.
Please come again.
