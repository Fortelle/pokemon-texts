Over here!
Well, if it isn't <var>.
I'd expect nothing less from you and your Charizard, Leon! You took down that Dynamax Pokémon in no time at all!
Well, I am the unbeatable Champion, after all! But what all is going on here?
An overflowing red light... Pokémon Dynamaxing without a Power Spot?
Yeah, but why?
I'm not sure... What's going on? That red light could suddenly appear again at any time and we'd have no way of knowing.
But being able to predict such things is part of a scientist's work.
Gran?!
The chairman called for me. He wanted to know all about the red light's relationship to the Dynamax phenomenon.
Did the chairman know anything?
Nothing worth my time. The chairman's all wrapped up in fretting over the future of our energy, apparently. He's left everything to that executive lady. We just don't have enough data.
That's why I wanted to ask you to start looking into things, too, Sonia. You know more than anyone about the Darkest Day, after all.
Are you saying that red light and the Darkest Day are connected?!
Hey, do you reckon there's anything we could do to help out?
There must be!
Yeah, we'll help!
Thanks! I appreciate the thought. But all I could ever ask of you would be that you join me in the greatest final match ever. I'll do my part to make that happen by keeping everybody's future safe. So you just keep on doing your part by winning your way through the Gym Challenge!
Right. Course! You're the unbeatable Champion, after all, eh?
Gran, there's something I want to look into. You'll help me, right?
Naturally.
Looks like we all know what we need to do. So, you two—clear the Gym Challenge so we can meet again at the Champion Cup!
I know what I need to do, all right— defeat that Piers once and for all! You're off to Hammerlocke Stadium, yeah, <var>? Raihan's a tough nut to crack!
