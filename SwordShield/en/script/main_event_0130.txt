*CRASH*
<var>! Did you hear that just now?
The gate's open! And the Wooloo that was there...
It was tackling the fence pretty hard earlier. You don't think it actually broke through there, do you?
But it's off-limits! Nobody's supposed to go in there! I remember the professor's granddaughter went in once, and she came back in a real state... And that was nothing compared to the earful she got from the professor afterward!
<var>... What do you say?
We've got to save it!
I don't know...
Right? Even if we're not supposed to, this is the kind of scene where you simply have to do what's needed!
Right... No one wants to get in trouble, least of all me. But deep down you want to save that Pokémon, too, don't you?
Hope you're ready for anything, because we're going in, <var>!

Come on, <var>! We can't just leave that Pokémon on its own!
