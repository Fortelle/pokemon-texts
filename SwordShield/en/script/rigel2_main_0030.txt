Please, sir! I can't let you—
Oh, I think you can! My precious daughter's in there, and I'm goin' in after her!
I understand, sir, but—
But what?! I'm here to have an adventure, and I want to kick it off right now!
I simply can't allow it, sir!
Grrr!
Oh, there you are, lad! So you've come after all, have you?
Oh, there you are, lass! So you've come after all, have you?
All right?
Something the matter?
Nothin's all right, and everythin's the matter!
This ultra-mega-numpty of a scientist insists on gettin' in my way!
"Numpty of a—"? I beg your pardon, sir!
If you'd be so good as to simply listen, I could let you through!
Dynamax Adventures are quite fraught with peril, I'm afraid, and—
Gaaah! I've got no patience for standin' here listenin' to you rattle off the fine print!
*sigh* We're just going round in circles.
You seem to know this gentleman. Would you simply listen to my explanation?
If so, then I could allow the two of you to enter as a pair.
Aha! Now you're talkin'!
Go on, then. Let's hear what the good lady's got to say! And then we'll go find my little Nia together! Right? Right!
