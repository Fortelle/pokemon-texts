Mr. Chairman! I've been collecting both Wishing Stars and Gym Badges as fast as I can!
Good work, Bede. I'm glad you haven't forgotten that it was the chairman who endorsed you.
If I gather enough Wishing Stars, that'll help solve the problem that's been bothering you, right, Mr. Chairman?
Oh, it's not just about me. It's for the future of the whole Galar region.
And we'll need more than just Wishing Stars. We need a powerful Pokémon Trainer, too— someone like the Champion.
With all due respect, sir, I was able to show Hop, one of the Champion-endorsed Trainers, just how outclassed he was.
I'm sure I'll be able to defeat the Champion. No, I WILL defeat the Champion!
That's the spirit! It takes healthy competition to really keep the Gym Challenge energized!
Challenger Bede, there is something I wish to discuss with you. Do you have a moment?
I hope you were listening, <var>.
As you know, Wishing Stars are those mysterious stones that are even attached to your Dynamax Bands.
There's more to Wishing Stars than just making your Pokémon into giants, though! They hold far more energy than that!
If you're curious, you should head to the stadium. In fact, we should head inside right away! I'll even give you a little lesson on how the Galar region gets its energy!
