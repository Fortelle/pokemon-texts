I'm going to become the greatest Pok√©mon Trainer there is! And to do that, I need that endorsement to take part in the Gym Challenge!
Come at me with everything you have so we can prove to Lee that we've got what it takes!

I'm rather interested in seeing how you two young Trainers battle, too.
Listen, you two. The reason I'm unbeatable is because I learn from every battle I see or take part in. That's how I've gotten to where I am today. So show me something good in this battle!
We'll be sure to. Ready for this, <var>? Time for a serious match between you and me... to fill in another page in the tale of my legend!
Of course!
I need to prepare...
It's time for my legend to begin!
Oh, fine... Guess I can wait a bit.
Hurry it up, <var>! You've gotta battle me so I can get myself that endorsement!
You remember what I asked you, don't you? I think you've got potential, and that's why I want you to be a real rival to Hop. And that's direct from your Champion Leon!
