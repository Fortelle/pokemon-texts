That's it, Slowpoke! Use that epic poison move!
Go, Slowpoke! Use an elegant move!
Slooow...
Aw, come on! Can't you at least try to be more energetic?
Unbelievable... Truly UNBELIEVABLE! All that effort and I'm still just spinning my wheels...
Next time I battle himer, I'll be the one that comes out on top.
I need to get stronger so that a certain someone will recognize me for the great Trainer I am.
Huh? <var>?! How long have you been eavesdropping?!
<var>?! How long have you—! Can you use Agility or something?
Are you training?
How've you been?
Buzz off! I-it's none of your business what I'm up to!
Tch! Training while in hiding is not very elegant. I turn back what you say as though I used Mirror Coat!
I've been fine, thank you! And I'm glad to see you look like you're doin' fine, too! Now, stop botherin' me!
What an abrupt question... I am doing at least two billion times as well as you are.
Juuust forget ever seeing me here, 'K?
Forget what you saw me doing with the utmost of haste! Use Amnesia!
You can keep that—if you promise to keep your mouth shut!
You are to think of that as a contract between the two of us, understand?
And well... Good luck to you, too, I guess.
Well then, it's time for— You guessed it... Avery, Teleport!
Slooo...?
