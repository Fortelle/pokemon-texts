Ahhh... My delivery guy caught a cold and can't make it today.
You're the one who dined here with Chairman Rose, right? Would you please help us deliver some food?
Oh, sorry for asking something so strange.
Thank you! I truly appreciate it!
As for where to deliver the food... Sorry, I forgot to ask for an address.
I heard a clickety-clack sound from the phone. Maybe that's a clue as to where to go?
Thanks for delivering the food. Here—something for your trouble.
Come back sometime for more work!
Back again? I wanted to ask you to deliver some food again. Is that OK?
I don't know if this helps, but I think I heard a Pokémon cry over the phone. Like...
The customer told me to look for a green roof, but I wonder if there is such a house in Hulbury.
Thank you for taking care of all the deliveries. You really helped us out.
This is a little token of my gratitude. Please take it.
Welcome! Oh, it's you. Please relax and stay as long as you'd like.
Oh, are you delivering my food? Thank you for your trouble! This restaurant's dishes are full of seafood and so delicious!
I've already paid the restaurant, so I'll give you candy as a tip!
For someone so young, you sure are a hard worker!
Ah! I'm starving! Oh, I can smell the ocean. You're from the restaurant, aren't you? I've been drooling while waiting for the food! Thank you for delivering the food!
You get energy from food! You should eat balanced meals!
You're delivering food? Well, hey! I'm the one who ordered it! The tail curry of this restaurant has a unique flavor. I love it! Say hi to the manager for me!
It was easy to spot the green roof, wasn't it?
Swiiirl.
You received the ordered food.
You handed over the ordered food.
