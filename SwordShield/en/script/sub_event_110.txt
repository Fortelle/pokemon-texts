Name's Cara Liss. I am researching Fossils, huh.
Fossils in Galar are broken into top halves and bottom halves for some reason, huh. Strangely, no matter which top and bottom you combine, they can be restored together. Perhaps, within this mystery, lies the key to understanding these combinable Pokémon, huh.
Hm? You've got some Fossils there, huh. Will you show them to me, Cara Liss?
Don't act so haughty.
Which of your Fossils do you think stands up to the high standards of Cara Liss?
Which of your Fossils do you think will pique the curiosity of Cara Liss?
Fossilized Bird
Fossilized Fish
Fossilized Drake
Fossilized Dino

So I should restore the <var> and the <var> together, huh?
Yes, please
I want to try something else

OK. Restoration time. Let's unravel the mystery of these Fossils!
All right, I'll stick 'em together! Here...we...GO!
Objective complete. It seems the restoration was a great success. Yes, I can see it in its eyes. This is a Pokémon that walked the face of Galar in ancient times! Please take and care for this Pokémon, huh.
Looks like there's no room in your Boxes, huh.
