Ta-da! You took the time to talk to a Poké Ball, so you deserve a little reward!
In case you were wondering, I'm not just any old Poké Ball! But then who am I, you ask? Well, the answer is simple. They call me the Ball Guy!
I'll be rolling around stadiums here and there, so if you see me, don't be shy! Come up and say hi!
Hi there, Champion! I've been waiting for you!
If I can become mates with the Champion, then maybe I can finally become the official mascot of the Gym Challenge...
Oh, before I forget! You were able to become Champion thanks to my cheers, right? So, here's something to make sure you don't forget your old friend Ball Guy!
A super-rare League Card! You'll be the envy of every collector out there, I promise you!
Don't worry about the card's slight wrinkling. That's just because everyone tried to get their hands on it! I know it looks like a common one, but mark my words—it's a true treasure of a League Card!
Hello there! It's your good friend Ball Guy! Don't you worry—I'll always make sure every Gym Challenger has a ball! It's my duty as the volunteer mascot of the Gym Challenge!
