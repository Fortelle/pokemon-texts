There you are! I've been waiting! Let's have a battle, you and me. We'll get in a bit of training!
All right!
But why?
I knew you'd be up for it! We've got to stay keener than anyone else if we want to steal the spotlight from our rivals!
Seriously? This is the moment when you play along and act pumped up for battle! If you've gotta ask why we should bother training, you'll never make it through the Gym Challenge!
Just what I'd expect from my rival! You know what? I'll even give you one of my League Cards! That's how good I think you did in that battle.
Our Gym Challenge starts right now—from here in Motostoke! Although the first Gym Leader we'll have to challenge is in a town way far off from here... Still, you'd better believe I'm going to keep on winning my way to that Championship Match!
Hello, Galar! Meet your next Champion! From the sleepy town of Postwick—it's me, Hop!
