Wh-what in the world?!
Such a huge noggin! And...it's got a ride?!
Craw! Rrrownrawn! Rooowwwn crown!
Wagh! It can talk?!
Crooown... Crownrown.
What...what d'you want?
Rowrooowwwn crrrooowwwn.
Huh?! I-I've got no idea what you're sayin'! But...somehow it also makes sense?
Hold the phone! What in the world are you anyw—?
Oh, not again— Mlerrrgh...
Human child!
Thanks to your efforts, I have been reunited with my loyal steed.
And now I am finally at my full power!
I was convinced that the people no longer believed in me... And I had also lost my loyal steed... I was trapped in the throes of deep loneliness.
But you saved me.
There are truly no words with which to fully express my gratitude to you.
So...I have a suggestion.
If you are able to catch me even with my powers restored...
it will prove your worth beyond any doubt, and I will lend you my strength on your journey.
Once you have readied yourself, come face me.
Ah, but first...
I should get this man back to where I found him.
It would be no good to let him freeze out in this frigid clime.
