Hey there. The name's Gordie.
So you managed to reach me without falling into any of the holes... Of course, you'd stand no chance against me if you let a few holes get in your way.
I admit I feel a little bad for doing this to a Gym Challenger, but... I'm going to use this match to show the crowd that my Pokémon are unbeatable!
So, let's get this over with, Challenger!
That was...impressive.
Rules are rules. Here, take this Rock Badge.
You can now catch Pokémon of up to Lv. 50!
Oh, don't worry about me. I just need to train harder, that's all.
As celebration of your victory over Gordie, take this TM!
And here's a special uniform! It's the same design that Gordie wears, and that means it's extra cool!
The Rock Badge looks good on you! You're doing great, Challenger <var>!
Do you want to go back to the reception area?
