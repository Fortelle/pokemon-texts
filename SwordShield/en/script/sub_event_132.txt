I sense great potential as a Trainer in you. But it's still a bit early... Please come back when you become the Champion.
Eek! Champion! Do you want to teach your Pokémon the marvelous move <var>?
See you!
Oh, Champion. The Pokémon you are with right now can't learn this move...
Which Pokémon do you want me to teach this move to?
Sorry. <var> can't learn this move.
An Egg can't learn this move!
<var> already knows this move!
Which move should be forgotten?
<var> learned <var>!
One...two...and...ta-da! <var> forgot <var>! And it learned <var> instead!
Steel Beam is an incredibly powerful move, but the user will take damage, too.
