Huh? <var>?! What're you doing here in the woods?
What about you?
The truth is...
Nobody ever comes in here, since this is the forest where Zacian and Zamazenta rested. It's the best place to do a bit of thinking, since it's so quiet and all.
You say you felt like something was calling you here, <var>? That's... Mate, that's pretty uncanny.

I've been thinking, you know... Maybe the reason Zacian and Zamazenta chose a place like this to sleep was because no one ever comes here and it's so quiet all the time.
Oh, but I hadn't had the chance to tell you! Congrats on your victory, <var>!
Honestly, <var>... I never thought you'd manage to beat my brother. The greatest Champion Galar ever had! He was undefeatable till you came around!
It's actually still pretty hard to believe...
Really... You're amazing, <var>.
So amazing, maybe, that I don't even realize just how amazing you really are!

<var>, do you think... Would you be up for one more battle?
Sure!
Why?
Thanks, <var>! Then show me the strength that defeated Lee, the greatest Champion we ever had!
Because I want to feel for myself the strength that defeated my brother, the greatest Champion we'd ever had... Come on, <var>!
I'm ready when you are, so just say the word!
