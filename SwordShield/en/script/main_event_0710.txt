You again...
I'd feel sorry for my Pokémon if I made them take part in a battle against low-level opponents.
I'm not in the mood to deal with weaklings right now. Then again, I suppose it's a form of mercy to crush weak opponents early on.
If you're under the misguided impression that you're stronger than me, then surely you would be up for a Pokémon battle.
Naturally!
Hold on a minute...
It's utterly inconceivable that I, the challenger chosen by the chairman, will lose!
Hmph! I've no time to deal with pathetic Trainers!
Ah, pardon me. It seems I must take back my words. You're not weak—you just lack talent. Your chances of completing the Gym Challenge are pretty slim, I must say. Here, I'll give you this. Something to show you at least tried.
Now, where shall I go next to collect Wishing Stars?
I'm just gonna keep my mouth shut... Otherwise, his Pokémon will just knock me down again... Nah, not doin' that...
I'm havin' me a lovely little dream... A dream where I actually won the battle...
