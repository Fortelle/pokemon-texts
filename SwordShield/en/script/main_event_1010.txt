Bow wark!
Looks like my Yamper really likes you, huh? Anyway, we've run into each other at a good time.
You know the mural here in Stow-on-Side? It's said to tell the story of the hero of Galar as well. Though what's there today is actually a replica of the ancient art that used to be here...
You tend to have surprisingly sharp insight, so I was wondering what you might think when you see the ruins.
*Ka-BOOM*
Wha...? What in the world was that? Sounds like it came from the direction of the ruins, too...
Let's have a look! Come along, Yamper!
What's going on up there?!
