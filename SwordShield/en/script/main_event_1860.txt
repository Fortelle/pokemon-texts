Hey! Where're you going?! We need your help over here!
You two... What in the world are you doing?
What?! Come off it, Sonia! You must've seen that, right?! Those...those...sword and shield Pokémon! They were right in front of us! But then they disappeared into the forest...
Hop, you sure you haven't lost the plot? There was no one here but the two of you...
Wha... Then were those just...illusions or something?
Listen! I dug into some literature from other regions, and I finally found something! Mentions of the sword Pokémon, Zacian, and the shield Pokémon, called Zamazenta. The writings said that those two Pokémon were born somewhere beyond the Slumbering Weald sometime long, long ago.
Did they really? Ta, Sonia. Thanks for digging into it.
Even if it is just an illusion or whatever, we did manage to find that Pokémon again... Maybe the sword and the shield that those two used to carry are still here, too!
Zacian and Zamazenta... They may have been sleeping in the Slumbering Weald right next to your hometown all this time. Perhaps that's why no one has entered the deepest parts of these woods for so long...
