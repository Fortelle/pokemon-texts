Are you ready to hear my explanation of Dynamax Adventures?
Come on, mate! Don't leave me hangin'!
Please pay the gentleman no mind. Come and speak to me when you're prepared.
That's what I like to hear, mate! I owe you one!
Very well. Then I will proceed.
The Max Lair is a labyrinthine underground cavern where rare Pokémon dwell—the likes of which normally are not found in the Galar region.


To avoid the risk of Galar particle overexposure, which can cause your own dear Pokémon to lose control...
we have prepared Pokémon for you that are resistant to the particles' effects.
Right, right—I follow you! You're sayin' you don't want Galar losin' control, so the Pokémon rent some particles, and we might see a rare overexposure!
That was stunningly incorrect, sir.
This is a dangerous place. Please make sure you've a firm grasp of the rules.
I'm still a touch lost, but...that's the type of place this is, eh?
Right! Sounds like this is all a bit beyond me, so I'll just go on in and get crackin'!
Here comes Papa, my darling Niaaa!
Sir! No! I've just told you it's too dangerous!
What is going on with that man? He looks so much like Chairman Rose, but his attitude doesn't match the chairman's at all...
Well, when you're ready to go chase him down— *sigh* Pardon me. I meant, when you're ready to begin your Dynamax Adventure, please let me know.
