Champion <var>! And Piers and Hop, too!
Mr. Kabu! I'm glad you remember me.
Of course I do! You two were red-hot, after all! I'll never forget seeing you off after you'd completed your first leg of the Gym Challenge.
Oi, can we save the nostalgia for later?
Don't think we really got the time for a friendly chin-wag.
Right! Actually...the situation's getting pretty bad over at the stadium.
Yeah. That'd be why we're here.
Ah, brilliant! The opponent's a bit much to take on single-handedly, so I was wondering what to do.
But with you all at my side, my confidence in this battle is burning brighter by the minute!
Let's begin!



Looks like we were able to extinguish things this time.
I'll let this Pokémon rest here at Motostoke Stadium until it gets its energy back.
And, <var>, should you have need of my help, please do not hesitate to ask.
Don't worry—I know... You all have more work that needs to be done, yes?
Go forward, youths! I wish you well!
