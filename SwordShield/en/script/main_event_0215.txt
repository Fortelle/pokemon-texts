Hey there, Trainer! Sorry to stop you.
You just left the Pokémon Lab, right? So that means you've got a Pokédex, yeah? I love talking to new Trainers and giving them useful stuff.
It's a Potion. Use it when your Pokémon's HP— their hit points—gets low. HP is like a Pokémon's stamina. You can even use Potions during battle.
Knowledge is power! It's a good idea to talk to lots of different people and read everything you can on your journey!
