Why, Hop dear. I see Wooloo has made some new friends.
And you must be <var>. I trust you received the Pokédex from Sonia. I'm sure you'll have it complete in no time!
You must already know about Dynamaxing, right, <var>?
Professor Magnolia's been doing research into the Dynamax phenomenon for years and years. And it takes a proper understanding of the thing if you plan to use Dynamaxing to the fullest!
There you go again, Leon, always talking about Pokémon. There are other things that are worth knowing about, too, you know. Like how many different types of tea there are!
Hey, Professor, do us a favor, would you? Help me convince Lee he should endorse us for the Gym Challenge!
Oh Leon, why wouldn't you endorse them?
Hop and <var> only just started out as Pokémon Trainers... There's still loads they don't know yet!
Dearie, I thought your dream was to have everyone in the Galar region become strong Trainers. Isn't that right?
Well, yeah...you're not wrong. That goal's precisely the reason I gave them both Pokémon, in fact.
Right, then. In that case...how about this? Let's see if the two of you can show me such a brilliant battle that I'm left with no choice but to endorse you. And don't worry. I'll make sure both your teams are in good shape before the battle starts.
Right! I'll be waiting outside, <var>!
Now remember, be sure to give it everything you've got. That's the best thing you can do for your Pokémon—and for yourself, too.
