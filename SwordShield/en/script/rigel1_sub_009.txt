Oi, oi! We don't get too many Trainers out in these parts!
They call me Digging Pa. You've met the Digging Duo? Well, they'd be my sons!
Digging Pa's the name, and digging's my game. Well...more my vocation, really.
Haven't got any Armorite Ore, have you? You know, it's that rare type of rock the Isle of Armor's known for?
If you just give us a few pieces of that ore, I'll put these fine old muscles straight to work, digging you up loads of Watts!

Shall I dig you up some Watts in exchange for <var> pieces of Armorite Ore? You'll need to jot down a quick record of your progress first, if that's all right.
Well, give us a shout if you need Watts!
Digging Pa...at your service! What can I do for you today?
Dig me up some Watts
Tell me what my record is
Nothing, thanks


Right then. Here goes!
I've dug up <var> W just now. Shall I keep on digging?
Phew! That's all the digging I've got in me!
H-hold on! I can...I can still keep digging!
Graaah!
Heh! Feels like I could dig up a Watt trove like I haven't seen in ages!
Here goes!
There's <var> W!
One last go, then!
Digging <var>!
Phew. Right. Feels like I've settled down a bit.
I dug up <var> W altogether this time.
Your record is <var> W in one session.
Oho! Got yourself some Armorite Ore, have you? Mind giving us <var> pieces?
If you get your hands on some Armorite Ore, come give us a piece!
I've dug up <var> W!
Hold your Horsea! Bit short on Armorite Ore, aren't you? Come again when you've got a good <var> pieces!
Y'know what? Our meeting feels like a real stroke of luck! If you like, I'll dig you up some Watts for free to mark the occasion! You'll just need to jot down your progress first. That all right?
