Over here, <var>!
All right, <var>? It's time we filled in our teams a bit—
And I'm here to teach you how! You'll need to catch Pokémon if you've got any hope of filling in that Pokédex.
Lee?! Where'd you come from?
Only...look at you, little <var>! You've already caught some on your own! Your mum gave you those Poké Balls, did she?
Every Pokémon has got a type or two, which can make it good against some opponents but poor against others. That's the reason you'll want to catch different Pokémon—to cover one another's weaknesses. Now, let's all have a champion time as I show you how it's done!



Typical Lee!
I'll give you some more Poké Balls. In return, I'll only ask that you catch plenty of Pokémon! The Pokémon around here seem easy to catch. Almost like they're itching to join some Trainer's team, wouldn't you say?
The Pokémon on your team will get Exp. Points when you catch Pokémon, too.
And of course, they get Exp. Points from battle, so take on the other Trainers you meet along the path to help your Pokémon thrive. Your team will keep on changing and growing as you get stronger together, no doubt... But even I don't know exactly how yet! Show your Champion something good, all right?
All right! I'm gonna catch loads of Pokémon. The professor will be shocked when she sees!
