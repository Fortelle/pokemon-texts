The strongest Dragon-type move is called Draco Meteor. Do you want me to teach the move to your Pokémon?
I understand... Moves that are too strong can be difficult to use.
It looks like your Pokémon can learn my move, but there's one condition that needs to be met. That is...the Pokémon has to be completely friendly toward you. I can teach the move only after the Pokémon becomes totally bonded with you.
None of the Pokémon you are with right now can learn this move... Come back when you obtain a Pokémon that can learn this move!
Then please select the Pokémon that will learn this move.
Oh, this Pokémon can't learn this move.
Oh, this is an Egg. It can't learn this move or any move.
Oh, this Pokémon already knows Draco Meteor.
Draco Meteor is indeed the strongest Dragon-type move. However, using it harshly lowers the user's Sp. Atk stat.
