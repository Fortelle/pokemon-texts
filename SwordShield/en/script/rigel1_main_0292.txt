Finally, <var>! I've been waiting forever for you!
I'd thought Glimwood Tangle was a real maze, but this place is on an entirely different level... And it's so hot and humid that I'm sweating a pond over here!
Sonia and I split up places to survey. And she opted for the cold and snow—and all. Too bad we can't somehow divide this heat up between us, too. We'd both feel a bit better!
Anyway, I was checking out this Forest of Focus place while I was waiting for you to show up... and I saw signs that Lilligant and Applin live here!
Maybe we can gather a bit of sweet nectar that Urshifu should love from their flowers and fruit.
I reckon Lilligant and Applin are the most likely Pokémon to produce any nectar here in the Forest of Focus. Let's see if they can't spare a bit for Urshifu!
