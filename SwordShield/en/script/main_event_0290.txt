And I even got my Poké Ball throw perfect, too!
This was you getting back at me for last time, wasn't it? Argh! I'm gutted to lose to you of all people!
Hah! See that! I knew I could do it. Am I ever glad I could beat you this time!
Undefeated! And my Pokémon's moves were seriously on point!
The sting of defeat and the joy of victory... I guess going through both is the key to the two of us getting stronger, right?
