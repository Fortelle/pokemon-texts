I've got to give it to Professor Magnolia. Everything in here looks fascinating...
Bow wark!
What is it today, Leon? Looking for info on another never-before-seen, superstrong Pokémon? I wish you'd stop with these outlandish requests.
Good to see you, too, Yamper!
Yamper here is a real champ when it comes to helping you find your way around. He came to my rescue plenty of times back in the day, when I got lost on the road. Oh yeah, and that's his Trainer, Sonia. What can I say about Sonia? Well, I like the way she cooks. She makes food you can gobble down in a flash.
Tsk. What kind of an introduction is that? Did you forget we were rivals during our Gym Challenge? It wasn't just Yamper helping you out. I did, too.
Anyway, nice to meet you! Name's Sonia. I'm the professor's assistant.
This is <var>. HShe's a new Pokémon Trainer. Set himer on the right path, would you?
*sigh* What does he think I am? He's always got his head in the clouds. It's no wonder he gets lost all the time.
Oh. Looks like you've got a Rotom Phone.
Hey there, Rotom!
Bzzzrt!
Rotom Phones are handy little things, aren't they? They've got a map and a navigation tool. That said, Leon still gets lost, so...
Oh, sorry. So tell me, do you know a lot about Pokémon?
You bet!
Not really...
Well said! In that case, I'll make it so that you can use the Pokédex on your Rotom Phone!
Don't worry! Here, I'll make it so that you can use the Pokédex on your Rotom Phone!
You obtained the Pokédex!
Just so you know, that Pokédex is a gift from my gran!
Could you let Gran know that you received the Pokédex? She lives in the house down along Route 2.
Leon's a right amazing Champion, and I'm basically just an assistant... I'm not even Gran's official assistant, either. I've just been calling myself one... Somehow, it makes me feel a little restless.
