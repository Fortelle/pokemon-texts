Well, come back anytime.
So, you're the new Champion! I can put any of your Lv. 100 Pokémon through Hyper Training.
What's this? Seems you don't have any Bottle Caps or Gold Bottle Caps.
Now, which Pokémon will I put through Hyper Training?
If it isn't Lv. 100, it's not hype enough to undergo Hyper Training.
Oh! <var> is already so strong, it doesn't even need any training!
Would you like to use a Bottle Cap or a Gold Bottle Cap?
You want me to hype up all of this Pokémon's stats?
Which stat should I hype up?
<var>: <var>








The training starts now!
This Pokémon can't be trained any further!
You don't have enough <var>...
Phew... <var> got stronger from the Hyper Training.
Want to keep the hype going with some more Hyper Training?

Which Pokémon should learn my move?
Which Pokémon should I have remember a move?
Which Pokémon should I have forget a move?
Hm? This move is quite rare. If your Pokémon forgets this move, it won't be able to relearn it. So I'll teach it another rare move for you.
<var> can't learn my move.
<var> already knows my move.
<var> learned <var>!
There are rare moves that your Pokémon can't learn by leveling up or by using TMs or TRs! If you're interested, I can teach them to your Pokémon.
You want one of your Pokémon to forget a move? If you want your Pokémon to use a move it's forgotten, it'll have to relearn the move first. So be careful.
I can have your Pokémon remember any move they should've had the chance to learn up until where they are now.
It doesn't seem like that Pokémon has any moves that it can forget.
It doesn't seem like that Pokémon has any moves that it can remember.
Huh? You can't choose an Egg! It hasn't even hatched yet!
<var> has already learned the special move.
Would you like me to teach this move to another of your Pokémon?
Is there another Pokémon you'd like me to help remember some moves?
Would you like me to have your Pokémon forget any other moves?
Shall I stop having your Pokémon forget moves?
Shall I stop having your Pokémon remember moves?
Shall I stop teaching your Pokémon moves?
Shall I stop the Hyper Training?
<var> has gained newfound determination and changed to its Resolute Form!
One...two...and...ta-da! <var> forgot <var>! And it learned <var> instead!
One...two...and...ta-da! <var> forgot <var>!
Which move should it forget?
Which move should it remember?



Which Pokémon's nickname should I rate for you?
Hmmm. <var>, is it? That is quite a fine nickname. But I think we could give it something even better. What do you think?
I see! What would you like the new nickname to be?
Done! From now on, this Pokémon shall be known as <var>! You're right—that does seem to fit it better. Nicely done!

Done! From now on, this Pokémon shall be known as <var>! It looks no different from before, but we both know this name is much better! How fortunate for you!
Hmmm. <var>! That is a truly impeccable nickname! I can't say anything bad about it! Take good care of <var>!
Now, now... That is merely an Egg.
Or do you want to quit giving the Pokémon a nickname and change back to the name that the Pokémon had when you two met?
Yes, yes. <var>! It reminds you of the time when you first met the Pokémon! Come see me again if you want to give Pokémon nicknames.
For a Pokémon you got from another Trainer, you only get one go at changing its name. It'll be <var> from now on and forever. So you're sure that's the name you want?
All right. Let me know if you change your mind.
Shall I rate another Pokémon's name?
Which Pokémon's memories are you interested in?
Somehow I can tell what Pokémon remember.
<var> seems to have memories from its time with another Trainer.
Do you want to hear about the memories of any other Pokémon?
