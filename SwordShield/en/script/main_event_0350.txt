Not quite so fast, you two.
What're you doing here, Mum?
I knew this day was coming since the moment you chose <var> as a partner, darling.
Professor Magnolia was kind enough to let us know that you two were setting out. So here—a last little gift to see you well set on your way. All the kit you'll need for camping!
No matter what happens out there, if you and your partner are together, I know you'll be fine.
Thanks, Mum. And just think how lucky you are— mother to the first ever pair of Champion brothers! Because I'm certain to be the Champion next. You'll see!
Of course you will be, darling. Anyway, do have fun and take care of yourselves! You'll be welcome back home anytime!
We're off!
We'll be fine!
Wish us luck! Not that we'll need it.
There are loads of brilliant Trainers and all kinds of Pokémon out there waiting for us!
My excitement's running ahead of me even faster than that train can go, <var>! Come on! We're off!
I imagine those two will be facing quite the surprise when they arrive in Motostoke.
But who can blame them? A train journey does always set the imagination on fire.
Boo ai!
