Several hours later...
This is absurd... Even Lee's never this late. Something's not right.
He always does what he says he'll do. As a kid, he promised me he'd become Champion one day, and he went and did just that!
He ought to be able to keep to his own dinner plans!
Kid's sure got a mouth on him, huh? If you were that noisy durin' battle, you'd unleash a whole new level of power, you know.
Oh, pack it in, Piers! I'm seriously worried here! So I don't need to see your smug mug looking like you're having a go at me, even though you act like you're giving me good advice!
Judgin' by appearances? No wonder you lost to your mate.
If you're lookin' for the Champion, I saw him headin' to Rose Tower.
Why would he go there?
Rose Tower?
Dunno what he's up to, but I ran into him at the monorail platform. He said to tell you that he had somethin' to do at Rose Tower, so he'd be late to your dinner.
But why Rose Tower? What could he have to do there at this hour?
Piers, do us a favor. Take us to Rose Tower, would you? Neither <var> nor I know the way.
Sheesh... What rude siblings, always so demandin' of others.
Though I s'ppose... It's a real problem for me, too, if the Finals are held up for any reason. And I don't really hate the two of you little runts. You were good enough to beat me, after all.
So I think I'll invite Team Yell along, and we'll all have ourselves a bit of fun. Shall we?
Brilliant! You're the best, Piers! Let's go make a real ruckus!
