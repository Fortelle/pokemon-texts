Coming this way? I'd advise against it. Any Trainer with a Wishing Star is in for a beating from me and my Pok√©mon!
You. You're the Gym Challenger endorsed by the Champion, aren't you?
What a joke. You are aware that the chairman is more important than the Champion, right? I was chosen by the chairman himself, so that makes me more amazing than you!
I suppose I should prove beyond doubt just how pathetic you are and how strong I am.
Well, that was unexpected. I suppose you're more able than I thought.
Naturally, I'll remember your battle style and strategies now. I'm sure to easily defeat you if and when we face each other in an official match.
Now that we've established that, I won't waste any more time on you. I've already gathered every Wishing Star in this area.
