*beep beep beep*
Hey, <var>? That your Rotom Phone ringing?
<var>! We've got trouble! Those two weirdos have showed up at the Pokémon Lab!
What?! Sonia, you all right?!
They keep rudely demanding I hand over Wishing Stars. I'm all right for now, but get over here quick, OK? These guys are right creepy!
*beep*
What're those two doin' goin' after Wishing Stars?
We've got to help Sonia and get back the <var>!
Let's hurry to the Pokémon Lab!
He really doesn't think anythin' through... Sure does make him seem a proper fool. Nah, guess the word would be "reckless."
We're headed to the Pokémon Lab next, right? Guess I'll stick by you till we see this through.
