I am a world-renowned designer of fashion!
You are Galarian, I presume? This is my first time setting foot in this region, and I must say...it seems rather deserted!
Erm, this is...
You're on the Isle of Armor!
I beg your pardon? I've disembarked at the wrong station?!
How fortunate you were here to steer me true! My most heartfelt gratitude to you!
I say, I've heard Galar's Champion, Leon, is quite the beloved figure in the region.
I smelled the opportunity to take advantage of Leon's wild popularity to seek further riches... Hence, my voyage!
But now I find myself without the funds to even reach my destination!
If you've a mind to purchase this delectably, surpassingly cute ensemble I've designed for ₽<var>, it would cover my taxi fare onward.
I'll take it!
I'll pass
Is this island to be my new home then?!
A Helping Hand in my hour of need! What a kindly soul!
My sincerest thanks, my friend! And as promised, here you are!
You got a <var> ensemble containing <var>, <var>, <var>, and <var>!
Some of these are hard to come by! You'll be pleased with your purchase—I guarantee it!
And with that, I bid you farewell!
Alas, you simply haven't the funds!
