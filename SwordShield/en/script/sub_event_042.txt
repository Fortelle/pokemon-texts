Waaaaaah! My Minccino's gone missing! What should I do?!
Can I help?
I don't have time to help right now...
Waaaaaaaaah!
Huh? You'll help me look for Minccino? Oh, thank you so much!
My Minccino really likes to play in the water, and it also likes the sound of whistling! I bet it's hiding somewhere where there's lots of water. But I can't think of a place with lots of water here in Motostoke... It has a weird cry that sounds like "Mworp," so if you hear that cry, try whistling!

Mworp...?
It's the missing Minccino!
Minccino went back to the boy.

Minccino? No, I'm just an old man.
I come here secretly to freshen up, but I guess I've finally been found out!
Let me give you a little something to remember our meeting!
Now then, I must be on my way! Farewell! Ha ha ha ha!
The man went home!
That's my Minccino!
Minccino came back! Thanks for helping me find it!
Please take this. It's my way of saying thank you!
Minccino is my best friend. But it's so full of energy, I can't take my eyes off of it!
