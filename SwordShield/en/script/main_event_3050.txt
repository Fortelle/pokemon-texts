Hm? You're...
Hello there, Champion! So, you came!
What's going on here?
It's been a while
Hah! How carefree can you be? You're the new Champion. You're bigger than a Dynamax Pokémon right now.
I was actually in the middle of an exhibition match with Piers. Then this Dynamax Pokémon came charging in.
The audience and staff already took shelter.
Gyaaan!
I got everyone who was seated on the north side of the stadium evacuated! You must've heard, right? More Dynamax Pokémon are running amok!
Much obliged, Hop! I'd expect nothing less from a Gym Challenger. I knew we could count on you.
I lost in the Semifinals, though...
Ah, <var>!
I chased those red and blue guys and saw them head into Turffield Stadium.
Then I heard that uproar, and there was no way I could leave it alone. I had to help out.
So, er... Sorry! I actually lost sight of them in all the rush.
Hm. Those suspicious characters you saw are concerning...
But for now, I think we should get this Dynamax Pokémon to settle down first!
I'd be glad for your help against such a tough- looking opponent, Champion <var>.
Of course!
Hold on a sec
All right. Then let's head to the pitch.
I'll lend a hand, too.
I don't blame the Pokémon, of course, but I'm still just a bit miffed they upstaged me.
You come too, bro of the old Champion.
I don't know how much I can really help...
If I come along, I might just end up slowing the rest of you down...
I don't really know the guy, but I don't think Leon'd be all lost about this. Though he does get actually lost a lot...
You comin'?
Uh... OK!
Piers might look scary, but he's great at looking after others. He's a big brother, after all.
All right, we should get going, too.
OK! Preparation is as important as laying seeds for the next harvest.
Are you ready to battle the Dynamax Pokémon?
Usin' Pokémon to ruin this stage... The Trainers that did this ain't gettin' off easy if I find 'em.
I wonder if there's anything more I can do?
