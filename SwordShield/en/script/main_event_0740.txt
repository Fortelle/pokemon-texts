That Carkol from before... I guess it must've been here on a job. You do know about Poké Jobs by now, right?
I do
Poké what?
Course you do!
Looks like there's no helping it, in that case... Settle down and let Professor Hop teach you a thing or two! Let's see if I can remember what Lee had written down in his old notebooks... Basically, you can have your Pokémon go about and help companies or other folks who are in need of something. You can take Poké Jobs from the Rotomi at any Pokémon Center, so give it a look sometime.
Now, I'm cream-crackered! I'm for the Budew Drop Inn and some sleep. Come tomorrow, that Fire Gym Leader Kabu better be ready, because I'll be coming for him!
Burning the midnight oil, are we? If you're here for the Gym Challenge, you won't be able to challenge Kabu till the morning.
For now, it'd be best to simply get yourself a good night's rest at the Budew Drop Inn!
