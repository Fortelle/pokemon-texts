The Hulbury Pok√©mon Gym's mission is this! A challenging maze! And you must reach the goal to clear the mission!
However, some paths in the maze are blocked by water. What should you do then?
Try pressing that red button over there, and I imagine you'll figure it out, future champ.
Now, let the Gym mission begin!
Did you need something?
What was the mission?
I want to withdraw
I'm good
Press the buttons to change the flow of the falling water, and try to reach the goal!
If you withdraw, you'll have to start over the next time you give the mission a try. So, are you sure?
Then I look forward to your next attempt!
Then on with you! And good luck!






Gym mission start!
Gym mission cleared!
I think you'll find you want to consider carefully the order in which you press the buttons.
