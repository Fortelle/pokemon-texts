You want to know if your Pokémon have really been giving it their best effort?
Oh, I see...
That Pokémon...
Yeah! It looks like it can still give a bit more!
This one really gave it their all! I'll give them something as a symbol of all their hard effort.
<var> got an Effort Ribbon!
That Effort Ribbon looks good on your Pokémon!
