Watching the Gym Leaders battle makes me want to have a Pokémon of my own.
Enjoying a nice meal while watching the match... This is how elegant Galarian ladies spend their time!

Hmmm... Maybe I want the extra-extra-large size!
My sister's always been quite the eater. She's got the ridiculous ambition of competing with Snorlax!
I love giving Wobbuffet a little poke. The way it bounces back is so satisfying!
Wob wob wob.
They say there are over two hundred Pokémon Abilities. Study them well, and you don't have to worry about being taken off guard during battles!
Nnntup.
