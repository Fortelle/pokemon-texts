It's cold outside, dearie. Why not stay awhile and get warmed up?
Cosohhh.
Oh, that's Fwoofy. I found it shivering outside the village and just had to bring it home.
You know, I think it was just about when I found Fwoofy that other strange Pokémon began appearing in the tundra...
I've never seen a Pokémon like Fwoofy before... Maybe it'd be best to have a proper Trainer take care of it. If only I could find a dependable one...
I've never seen a Pokémon like Fwoofy before... Maybe it'd be best to have a proper, dependable Trainer take care of it. Actually, I specifically had you in mind, since you helped defend the village and all. Do you think you could take care of Fwoofy for me?
Thank you for protecting the village from that awful bully of a Pokémon. I think I can trust you to take good care of my dear Fwoofy... Would you be willing to do that?
Have you reconsidered? Can I ask you to take care of my darling Fwoofy?
Oh... I suppose it is a lot to ask. I'm sorry for troubling you.
Oh, really? Thank you, dearie. That takes a weight off my shoulders.
Aren't you happy too, Fwoofy?
Mogmog!
Take good care of Fwoofy for me, dearie.
