Mugou!
Electric Memory—on! This'll help save on the electric bill!
Gumuuu?
Guess it really doesn't work until Type: Null evolves. Drat...
Oh, Champion <var>. It probably goes without saying at this point, but congratulations on your victory!
To commemorate your achievements, I present you with this rare Pokémon—Type: Null!
Ah, and these, too.
<var> received memories!
Once Type: Null evolves, its type will change depending on which memory you have it hold.
Ah, Champion! Are you taking good care of Type: Null?
