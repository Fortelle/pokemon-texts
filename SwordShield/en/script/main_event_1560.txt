Challenger <var>! Hey, Challenger <var>!
Got some time for questions?!
First question! You and Challenger Hop were both endorsed by the Champion, making the two of you rivals in a sense, wouldn't you say? How does it feel to have defeated your rival?
I'm glad I could beat him
It doesn't quite feel real yet
It was just luck that I won
Right... Question number two! If you wanted to tell Challenger Hop something right now, what would it be?
I'd thank him for the great match!
I'd tell him how strong he was
That he was just the rival I knew he was
Question three! Level with me, kiddo. Your honest thoughts here. Think you can win the Finals, too?
I absolutely do
I'm not sure...
I doubt it, really...
All rightâ€”that's enough! <var>'s already tired from battle! And you've been asking rather rude questions!
We've got ourselves dinner plans with my brother, so, sorry, but clear off already, would you?
Yes, yes, I understand! Looking forward to seeing the birth of a new star!
Phew... Famous people sure have it rough, eh?
I hope Lee gets here soon. I could eat my own arm about now.
