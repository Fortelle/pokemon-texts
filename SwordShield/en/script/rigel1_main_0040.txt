Oh, fiddlesticks... So our new student decided to go back home?
Seems that way, yep! I did my best to welcome himer, but...
It would appear so. I'll have you know, my offer to escort them was perfect.
she just suddenly left after our battle...
HShe rather abruptly absconded after our battle...
And I'd been hoping we'd get to welcome a new member to our little family here, too...
Well, hello? And who are you, love?
Huh?
Hmm?
Agh!
Gah!
Of course! You must be the new student that's supposed to join the dojo today!
Uh, sure...?
You've got the wrong person
Right, right, right, right! Exactly, ma'am! I swear! HShe must've changed hiser mind about joining the dojo!
Yes, right! That's correct, ma'am! I swear, I thought you had used Teleport or something, you disappeared so quickly!
Oh, but here you are! I'm sooo happy you decided to come after all!
Regardless! It gives me great joy to know that you decided to come after all!
Oh, everything's just coming up roses! Now, I'm quite sure they already told me your name, but...
It's <var>!
Uh, <var>...
That's right! You're <var>! Of course you are, love.
Though I'm rather sure that's NOT the name I was told before...
My name's Honey. I help keep this place running.
You can consider me the lady of the house. Not that the Master Dojo is just any old house!
Aaaagh! Why?! How?! What does she think she's doing, just showing up like that?!
Bagh! Why? For what purpose is she here?! My Future Sight must be off!
This ain't good... Ms. Honey will know that I lied!
I must think... Before Ms. Honey figures out I told an innocent little lie...
Seems you've already met our Klara. Bit of an odd Ducklett, but she's one of our own!
Seems you've already met our Avery. Bit of an odd Ducklett, but he's one of our own!
She's training hard here at the dojo so she can become a Gym Leader someday.
He's training hard here at the dojo so he can become a Gym Leader someday.
I can trust the two of you to get along, right?
I can trust the two of you to get along, right?
Hee hee, I'm sure we'll be best friends!
Heh, it's an honor to make your acquaintance.
Oh dear, but look at me!
Here I am making you stand around outside after you've come all this way!
Come in, come in! Don't mind the faint stench of sweat!
Listen, you... If you dare tell Ms. Honey about what happened at the station...
Now, listen... If you dare breathe a word of what happened at the station to Ms. Honey...
I'll melt you down to size! You understand?!
Well, let's just say my psychic powers are very potent. Do I make myself clear?
