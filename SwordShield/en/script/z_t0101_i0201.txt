It's one of the TVs that Hop always watches the Champion's matches on.
There are books about the Champion.
It's a family-size fridge that can store a lot of food.
This kitchen is always kept clean.
All these trophies belong to the Champion.
Meeeow!
To Hop, his brother is a superhero.
Even though Leon is no longer the Champion, he's still a superhero to Hop. Now that both are Trainers, Hop must've realized Leon is even greater than he'd imagined.
You know, the last time Leon came round, he actually took his time to enjoy a meal with us... It's been ages since I've seen him like that! Maybe we should all get together for another barbecue again sometime!
