Would you like to hear the details of the Gym mission carried out here in Circhester?
I would!
I'm good...
Then allow me to explain a little about the Trap Detector you hold in your hands!
The reason you'll need it is simple. There are invisible pitfalls everywhere in here!
If you fall into one, you'll have to start again from the last platform you reached. The detector will vibrate when there's a pitfall in front of you. The closer the hole, the stronger the vibration!
Then on with you! And good luck!
Did you need something?
What was the mission?
I want to withdraw
I'm good
Try to reach the goal without falling into any of the invisible pitfalls!
If you withdraw, you'll have to start over the next time you give the mission a try. So, are you sure?
Then I look forward to your next attempt!
Enjoying the Gym mission?
Congratulations on completing the Gym mission! So what do you say, <var>? Would you like to face the Gym Leader at once?
I would!
I'd rather not...
Very well! Move on ahead, and show that Gym Leader what you can do!
Of course. You no doubt have to prepare and save a record of what you've done. I understand!
Gym mission start!
Gym mission cleared!
Oooh, that's a right shame! And Challenger <var> goes down!
