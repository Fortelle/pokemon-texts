Whoa, it's huge in here! What in the world is this place meant to be?!
Listen, <var>... Don't know if you knew this already, but I've heard Rose Tower was built on a Power Spot. Yeah, you know what I'm saying... When we get up to the roof and have a bit of space, we can Dynamax our Pok√©mon!
Which is all well and good. But less certain is whether this lift can get us to the top...
Rose Tower has, like, a hundred floors, right?
You'll be leaving right now, so there's no need to worry about the lift!
Intruder alert. Intruder alert. All staff are ordered to help remove the intruders from the premises at once.
See? If Ms. Oleana says so, then it looks like this is the end of the line for you kids.
If I get rid of the intruders, I'll probably get a big bonus!
M-my bonus... My dream of finally affording a house of my own...
We need to speak with Chairman Rose! Tell us where he is!
Get on the lift. The chairman's at the top of the building.
All right! We're nearly to Chairman Rose!
Hold on, Lee! We're coming!
Come on, <var>! Let's crack on!
