Come on, Dad! Lay off and quit following me already!
I'm gonna go on a Dynamax Adventure in the Max Lair, and I don't need you breathing down my neck!
I'm here to battle loads and loads of rare Dynamax Pok√©mon!
Gahahaha! Don't you fret!
I know somewhere way more fun than that musty old place!
Get ready for loads of quality time with the coolest dad ever!
What a generous and totally unwanted offer! 'Fraid I've got to say "no, thanks"!
Excuse me! Hello? Lend a fellow Trainer a hand, would you?
