Lee! <var>!
That video stream... That was from Hammerlocke Stadium, right? What in the world did the chairman do...?
I don't know! But everything he was saying yesterday... Did he really pull this crazy stunt to solve some problem a thousand years in the future?! I've got to go see what's going on... I'm the Champion! I have to go!
I should've realized what the chairman intended to do before it came to this... I'll take responsibility now for fixing this mess!
This is the real Champion time!
But, Lee! You're terrible at directions... What if you get lost along the way?
I want to help my brother, <var>! I've got to! But I can't even manage to beat you, so what sort of help could I ever be...?
You can help!
Just try!
Easy for you to say...
But what? What can I even do?
Hold the phone... The chairman was talking about the Darkest Day. That's that thing where the sky went all dark once, ages and ages ago, right? What does he mean, he's bringing that about? And where did we even hear that name...?
Back in Motostoke
That statue of the hero...
That statue of the hero in Motostoke! Sonia said something back then, didn't she... Though it turned out to be wrong, since there were actually two heroes and all that. Still! Those two managed to bring an end to the Darkest Day with the sword and shield Pokémon!
Sonia thought the Pokémon might still be sleeping somewhere though, right? We should try to find them, <var>! But where to start looking...?
Back in the Slumbering Weald?
Back home in Postwick?
Maybe in Circhester?
You sure about that? I dunno... Doesn't feel right to me.
That's it, <var>! I'm sure it's got to be the Slumbering Weald! That illusion you tried to fight off that day— it must've been one of the Pokémon that are supposed to be sleeping there!
Let's go back to the Slumbering Weald! If we're lucky, we'll find something that can help!
