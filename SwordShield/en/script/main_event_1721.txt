If you're just tuning in, ladies and gentlemen, we witnessed quite the surprise during the Finals here at this year's Champion Cup, as the former Gym Challenger Bede stormed the stage! But <var> was having none of it! This year's top challenger made quick work of him before washing away Gym Leader Nessa!
And now to take himer on, here comes Gym Leader Allister—the boy known far and wide as the silent school-aged star!
...'M Allister. ...You look well.
I remember you... You were the strongest Gym Challenger I had. Er...so I reckon...we sh-should battle!
Challenger <var> has done it again! What a performance! HShe sails right through!
Crumbs...
...That was ace.
G-give it your best out there. I'm mad about strong Trainers...
Our seemingly unstoppable challenger is headed for the final round, but who will she meet there? Will it be I-Pass-on-Dynamaxing Piers? Or the Dragon Lord himself—Raihan? The next match will decide it, so don't go far from your screens!
