Welcome to Freezington. It must have been quite a journey to get here.
The Crown Tundra is famous for carrots, you know. Maybe you'd be interested in getting some Carrot Seeds as a souvenir?
Yes, please!
Uh, I'm good...
Hohoho! Quite the enthusiastic one, aren't you?
Now now, no need to be shy!
Though I must admit, these seeds are rather valuable to us...
How about a trade? You bring me <var> pieces of Dynite Ore, and I'll give you the seeds.
Hoho! Life is all about quid pro goâ€”or whatever the phrase was!
Do you want to trade <var> pieces of Dynite Ore for the Carrot Seeds?
Well, the seeds aren't going anywhere. Come back if you want to trade!
I appreciate the enthusiasm, but you don't have enough Dynite Ore.
You handed over <var> pieces of Dynite Ore!
Oh, wonderful! This is plenty! Now we can bury the ore in our fields and make our crops huge!
Here are the seeds, as promised!
Don't go planting those seeds I gave you willy-nilly in the village's fields, now! These fields are for our own crops!
Oh, you're looking for carrots? Well, you won't be finding any this time of year. We do have seeds right here...
