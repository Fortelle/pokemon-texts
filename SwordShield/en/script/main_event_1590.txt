So this is Rose Tower! Just how tall do you think it is? I can't even see the top, up there in the clouds.
So what should we do? Team Yell is gonna have their hands full holdin' up those bad League staff members. They won't be catchin' up anytime soon.
Yeah, <var>. What should we do?
Let's go ahead!
Wait for the others to catch up?
Good thinking! Let's go collect Lee and get out of here! Without him, there's no Champion for you to challenge in the Champion Cup!
'Fraid I can't agree to that, mate. Team Yell's giving it their all to help us out so we can go ahead and help Lee.
<var>, you cleared the way to Rose Tower. Now all you gotta do is charge on ahead.
An employee's an employee I guess... Seems that exec lady hid the monorail key to try and impress the chairman.
Chairman Rose's been keepin' the Champion holed up inside. Wonder what he's plottin'.

Times like this—when tension and passion run high—remind me of Spikemuth in the old days. Some right wild concerts we had back then. But no encores!
Wait, you're still here?
You better get goin'! I'll send some support your way with a yell!
Let's go, <var>!
Gotta stick around to make sure my bro doesn't do anythin' too crazy, right? Come back if you need anythin'.
