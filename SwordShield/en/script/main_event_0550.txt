Wooloo! Where do you think you're going?!
Beeeeeeh!
Wooloo crashed into you and stopped!
My... Are you OK? You took that Tackle head on...
Hmmm? Oh, you must be one of those Gym Challengers, right?
Yes, indeed!
No, I'm not
Ahhh, I thought so. I saw you at the opening ceremony.
Oh please, are you trying to have me on? I saw you at the opening ceremony!
My name's Milo. I'm a Gym Leader and rather partial to Grass-type Pokémon.
I've been itching to see just how good the Champion-endorsed Gym Challengers are... Let me find out at the Gym Stadium! Just head on through this route, and you'll run right into my stadium. See you there!
Come on now. Back to the stadium with you, too! We can't keep the Gym Challengers waiting!
Baaah! ♪
