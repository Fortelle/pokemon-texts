Fugaaa! Fugagaga! I'm a Pokémon! Have a battle with me!
Listen for a second. Scorbunny and Sizzlipede are different species, but they're still both Pokémon. Scorbunny and I are different species, just like Sizzlipede and I are different, too. If you think about it that way, there's no problem with calling me a Pokémon. I don't mind.
What? You don't have to worry about me. Even I know it's pretty lofty logic. I...I wanted to become a Pokémon once.
You can be one
Well...good luck with that
Hey, I've got it! A change of fashion style could change the way I feel, too! Basically, if I can make myself feel the way a Pokémon does, it'd be like I became a Pokémon, don't you think?
You! Would you please put on some clothes with a fiery spirit that embodies my burning feelings?
I appreciate you encouraging me, but I can't feel like a Pokémon that way. Please! Show me some clothes with a Fire-type design!
What's this? Is that...? I feel like I've completely become a Pokémon. Wearing a hot, fire-styled outfit can make you feel different. I feel like I've become a Fire-type Pokémon!
Thanks for cheering me up! It's hardly a proper reward, but I hope you like it anyway. Acrobatics is a move that does more damage if the user isn't holding an item!
I've been thinking... If a Cramorant swallowed me, and then someone else caught it... Would I be able to go inside the Poké Ball, too? If I did, I'd be the first person in humanity's history to be caught by a Poké Ball. "Gotcha! A man was caught!" They'd have to say something like that, right? Basically that means I'd equal a Pokémon, no? Yeah. Yeah, definitely "no."
