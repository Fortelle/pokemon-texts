<var>!
I'll be waiting for you in the final match!
After seeing the way you battled, I can't accept any outcome besides winning this match! My team is on fire!
Pardon me...
I know you didn't get a long break, but the match before yours ended more quickly than expected...
Challenger Hop won quite handily, so as soon as you're ready, we'd like you back on the pitch.
