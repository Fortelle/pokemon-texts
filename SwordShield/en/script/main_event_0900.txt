Oh, you're here.
Brilliant, aren't they? It's great that there are still treasured tapestries that can tell us of Galar's history.
The two youths watching a Wishing Star.
A disaster occurs... The two bewildered youths.
The youths looking on at the sword and shield that stop the disaster.
The youths being crowned.
These tapestries tell the story of the creation of a kingdom in Galar.
Say, young Gym Challenger, what sticks out to you most about them?
There's two heroes?
The Darkest Day?
Bang on! The statue at that hotel in Motostoke only had one hero, no matter how you slice it. But here, we clearly have two youths.
Right? That's got to be it. The story of the black storm that blotted out the skies was passed on through the years as a tale of disaster... That's what the Darkest Day is!
Was there really only one hero, or were there two? And what even caused the Darkest Day?
Thanks for letting me bounce some ideas off you. I think I've got some theories now. I'm going to research the tapestries a tad more, but you have your Gym Challenge, right? I'm cheering for you, so take a couple of these. I hope to see more of your wins!
Whatever happened to the sword and shield that drove off the disaster?
