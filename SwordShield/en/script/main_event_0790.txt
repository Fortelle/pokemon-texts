Welcome! I am Kabu, the Fire-type Gym Leader. The fact that you are here means you've bested both Milo's Grass-type Pokémon and Nessa's Water types, too. That's quite an accomplishment!
Every Trainer and Pokémon trains hard in pursuit of victory. But that means your opponent is also working hard to win. In the end, the match is decided by which side is able to unleash their true potential.
I'm often regarded as the first real roadblock of the Gym Challenge, and yet you defeated me! Clearly, your talent surpassed my many years of experience. I still have much to learn!
I know now that you and your Pokémon will become a fantastic team. I'm glad I could battle you today!
Let me give you a Fire Badge as proof that you've defeated me!
You can now catch Pokémon of up to Lv. 35!
Thanks to the Dynamax phenomenon, our Pokémon battles have become part of the Galar region's culture.
And it's the young Trainers who are responsible for keeping our culture alive. Of course, I hope that instead of just keeping it alive, you also help it become something better. We adults will be the pillars for you to build on.
Do you want to go back to the reception area?
