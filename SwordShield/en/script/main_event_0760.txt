Slow moving, aren't you, <var>?
I've already gone and earned my Fire Badge!
That man of fire Kabu is just what you'd expect. Nearly got burnt in my battle with him! Even with my strongest team, it was definitely touch-and-go...but I still won in the end!
Get a shift on, <var>! I bet you could beat the man of fire, too!
