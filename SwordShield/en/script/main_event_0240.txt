Listen, <var>. I've been thinking... If you're a Pok√©mon Trainer now, you must want to try your hand at the Gym Challenge, right?
The Gym Challenge?
What's that?
The Gym Challenge, mate! The annual competition where Trainers can battle it out for the right to challenge the Champion!
But the trick is that you've got to be endorsed if you want to take part. And Lee doesn't seem to think I'm up to snuff... So I'm thinking I ought to talk to the professor and see if she could help!
You've got to take part, too! A proper rival is just the thing every Trainer needs to keep growing stronger, after all. Keeps you motivated, right?
The professor's house is way down at the end of Route 2, so let's head there...and give our teams the chance to train up a bit along the way!
