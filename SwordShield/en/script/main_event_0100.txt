The next day...
You spent the whole night with that new partner of yours, right, Hop? You two getting on all right? Understanding one another? Maybe even built up a bit of love?
Course I have, Lee! <var>'s made fast friends with hiser <var>, too.
Then listen up, new Trainers! Believe in yourself and your Pok√©mon! If you trust in one another and carry on battling side by side long enough, then someday...
you might even become worthy rivals for me, the unbeatable Champion!
What're you looking at himer for, Lee?! I'm the one who'll be coming to challenge you!
If you think <var> might be able to challenge you, then I guess she's my first rival! But I'm not planning to lose to himer and miss out on my chance to beat the unbeatable Champion!
