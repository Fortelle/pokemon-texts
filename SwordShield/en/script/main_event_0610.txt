Thanks, Yamper!
Bow wow wow!
I had you come 'cause I wanted to hear what you thought.
So, that geoglyph... What do you think of it?
The Darkest Day?
Dynamax?
Right perceptive of you. Especially since the portion depicting the black storm has mostly disappeared.
Seems likely... It certainly looks like a gigantic Pokémon. I suppose people three thousand years ago could've just imagined this, but it looks too similar to Dynamax. It can't just be coincidence.
A long time ago...a great black storm covered the Galar region. Giant Pokémon ran rampant... But what was that black storm they called "the Darkest Day"? What connection does it have to Dynamax?
Guess I'm the lucky lady who'll be looking into that... Gran sure gives me a lot to do.
Thanks for your thoughts on the matter! As thanks, I'll give you a League Card.
Milo's a Grass-type Gym Leader. Things will go well for you if you use Fire-, Flying-, or Bug-type moves. Take these, too! It'd be pretty bad if your Pokémon weren't in fighting form!
Go on, then! Get yourself to Turffield Stadium and battle yourself silly!
