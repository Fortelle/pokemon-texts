Challenger <var>, the chairman asked me to deliver this gift to you.
A gift...such a wonderful thing... From the chairman...such a wonderful man...
*ahem* Excuse me. The gift is access to the Flying Taxis!
They allow you to, in a word, Fly! Calling a Flying Taxi will allow you to travel quickly back to areas you've already visited!
If it's all right with you, I'll read a segment from the Flying Taxi user's manual. *ahem* "Press the X Button and select the Town Map option to choose the place you'd like to go to."
Anyway, your next goal should be Turffieldâ€”isn't that right, <var>? When traveling to a new place, it's best to get there on your own two legs, don't you think?
