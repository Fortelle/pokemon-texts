I was the one chosen by the chairman... I was the one who was to defeat the Champion... I'm one of the elite—someone who can shoulder the future of the Galar region!
Challenger Bede!
I wondered what you were up to when you asked to borrow Chairman Rose's Copperajah... I can't believe you'd try to use the chairman's Pokémon to destroy a historical site!
Who cares for some ancient ruin when the next thousand years are at stake?! Did you stand in the path of a Pokémon's Simple Beam or something? How do you expect to support the chairman with that sort of thinking?
Young Bede...
It pains me to have to say this, but... I am truly disappointed. It's true that I am the one who found you, back when you were all alone...
I saw talent in you. You reminded me a little bit of myself, back when I was young. That's why I sent you to a Trainers' school, to give you a chance at success.
But trying to destroy the mural—part of Galar's history! You show no love toward Galar! You are clearly not a worthy challenger for the Gym Challenge.
We will decide what to do with you later. For now, you will return to Hammerlocke.
You...you must be joking, right? You're disqualifying me from the Gym Challenge? But you're the one who endorsed me! There are a hundred different ways we could sort this out... Why are you choosing the worst possible option?!
Challenger Bede. I will be taking those Wishing Stars that you have gathered.
Ah, Sonia! And <var>, too. Terrible shame, all this. An absolute disaster. I never wish to see us lose challengers for this sort of reason. Yet we do what we must do to keep things fair and sportsmanlike.
You know, during one of Bede's matches, I heard the announcer say that Bede has no family. Apparently it was Rose who took Bede under his wing, and so Bede was battling for the chairman's sake.
What an awful turn of events... I hope the mural survived all that.
