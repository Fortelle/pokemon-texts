See that, <var>!
The sword and the shield! The legends really were true!
That settles it! I'm taking the shield!
That settles it! I'm taking the sword!
Though...wow, would you look at the state of this thing? It seems like it might fall to pieces if you so much as look at it funny. I don't know if these rusty old things will really be able to stop the Darkest Day, but... Well, I guess it can't hurt to have them along! Let's hope they bring us some good luck!

Maybe the Pok√©mon themselves really are still asleep somewhere. So it seems we're on our own if we want to go help Lee. This is all the help we've got!
If anybody's gonna help Lee now, I guess it's just you and me, mate! He's probably still at Hammerlocke Stadium, trying to keep the Darkest Day at bay. So what d'you say, <var>? Wanna grab a Flying Taxi to head right there?
Let's go!
Not yet
Then let's get out of this gloomy forest and fly back to Hammerlocke!
Can't say I blame you... Even I'm a bit gutted to have come all this way chasing legends only to find a rusty old sword and shield...
