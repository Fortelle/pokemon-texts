Huh? What's that?!
<var>! Would you look at this? They're Wishing Stars! Since there are two of them, you should take one yourself!
With one of these, my Pokémon can Dynamax! They're gonna be massive! YES!
Trust you to pull something like this! They say Wishing Stars fall down for those who have a true wish in their heart, you know.
I will be the greatest Trainer ever! I WILL be the greatest Trainer ever! I WILL BE THE GREATEST TRAINER EVER!!! There! I've said it three times, so surely my wish will come true now, right?
Don't be silly, Hop. Those Wishing Stars are composed of a curious sort of rock containing unknown power... They are one of the most precious resources we have here in the Galar region. But they won't do a thing for you in that state. Give them to me now, and I'll have you sorted.
Ah, right. You've done heaps of research on the Dynamax phenomenon, haven't you, Professor? Then please! Give <var> and me the power to Dynamax our Pokémon!
First we got to battle against that mad Pokémon in the Slumbering Weald, and now this... It really feels like we're getting caught up in the adventure of a lifetime!
I do understand your excitement, young man, but don't get carried away. You want to save your energy for tomorrow's journey!
Seems I came back home right in time for all the excitement!
Hey, you lot, why not have some dinner. You must be hungry, right? I've been totally obsessed with making the latest trendy curries.
