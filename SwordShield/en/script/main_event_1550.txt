<var>! That was incredible. Brilliant. Honestly...there were even tears rolling down my face before I knew it.
To think that the two of you set out together from the same town, built up the greatest teams, and arrived here at this point to throw everything you had at one another...
That burning desire to win... Those moves filled with undefeatable passion! It was battling at its very purest, in every possible way!
Even though there were some Trainers who weren't sure whether you were fit to be endorsed for the Gym Challenge at first...
That was you, Lee!
Well then, all the more reason! My team members and I will give everything that we've got in us to defeat our challenger.
And the challenger standing before us might well end up being you, <var>. In fact, that's precisely what I'm hoping for!
That's right, <var>! The real challenge is what's coming next.
And I'm completely exhausted! I just want to head back to the hotel and rest.
Best to refill your energy stores first! Why don't we go get some dinner together?
I wouldn't say no, but... you never care at all what food tastes like, Lee! A night like this deserves more than rubbish takeaway, so at least pick something good!
