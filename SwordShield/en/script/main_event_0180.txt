Well now, isn't <var> just a sweetheart! And yes, I heard the news from young Leon. I'm glad someone bothered to tell me! Off to Wedgehurst, aren't you?
Here we are! A bit of pocket money for your journey. Buy yourself a little something at the Pok√©mon Center. Maybe some Potions or something!


Remember that <var> will battle to the very end for you... So don't you go pushing the poor dear too hard!
Fah!
Wah?
Tumtum!
And you, <var>! Look after my little <var>!
Come home to rest anytime that you need. After all...east or west, home is best.
