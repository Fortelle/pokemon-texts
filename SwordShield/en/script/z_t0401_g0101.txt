When to Dynamax...? It might be a good idea to think ahead about which Pokémon is able to withstand Nessa's Max Moves.
I like your team—it's very charming! Let's both do our best to complete the Gym Challenge, OK?
Why do we have to figure out a puzzle just to face the Gym Leader...? Maybe it's to tell us Trainers that we need to have some mental flexibility?
<var>... I'll remember your name.
Challenger <var>! Beat Nessa, OK? Promise!
I'm glad I became your fan, Challenger <var>!
Bugugug.
A challenger!
What a fierce battle!
Champion!
Nessa is strong, and that's what's beautiful!
Nice battle!
Hey! It's the best Champion of them all!
