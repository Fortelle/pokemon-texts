This is taking ages...
What? I don't think we're at the roof yet... Why have we stopped?
You two are Gym Challengers, aren't you? Thank you for taking part in the Galar League's Gym Challenge! Yet I'm afraid that doesn't give you the right to interfere in our work. We will drive you out to protect the many subsidiary companies housed here in Rose Tower!
Behold the gloriously high-tech elevators of Rose Tower, able to withstand Pokémon battles! They are constructed by the subsidiary Macro Cosmos Construction!
If I've been defeated, I have little choice but to respectfully retreat. Yet I must ask once more that you please do not interfere with Chairman Rose's work.
The elevators in Rose Tower are constructed so that only the floor ascends. But that presents some danger, thus the presence of these walls constructed of light. You can thank Macro Cosmos Construction for providing this wonderful technology as well.
Wait... So the folks working in the tower can stop the elevator from the outside at any time? We're just trying to get to the top already!
Our teams have been working themselves ragged for us. Let me heal them all up.
Rose Tower is almost a thousand feet tall! You are now about five hundred feet above the ground!
I'm from MC Insurance! Do you have a life insurance policy?
I'm quite terrified of heights, actually...
Unfortunately, our insurance doesn't pay out for being defeated in Pokémon battles...
You're nearly to the top! But you'll not be meeting the chairman!
I've got no fear of heights! I work high in the skies doing my job for the lofty Macro Cosmos Air!
Don't you presume to meet the chairman! You're not on the same level as such a great man!
You must know that in high-rises such as this one, the higher up you go, the more important the people you find working there. Chairman Rose is at the top of the top! Not just of this tower, but of all Galar!
Looks as though we're nearly there, mate... Look sharp! Let's do this!
