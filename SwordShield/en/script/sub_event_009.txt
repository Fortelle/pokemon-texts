Congratulations, Champion. Here, I've got a little something for you as celebration.
Professor Magnolia! Why, you didn't have to come all this way!
After everything <var> has achieved, it's really the least I could do.
The Wishing Stars that make Dynamaxing possible are parts of Eternatus. And when Eternatus was awakened, Dynamax energy flooded the entire region...
Because of that, Dynamax Pok√©mon were popping up all over, causing trouble across all of Galar. But <var> and hiser friends came to our rescue.
The Dynamax phenomenon has long been an important part of Galarian culture. I hope everyone will use the power of Dynamaxing correctly in the days to come.
So, young <var>. Please, do what you believe is best.
Poor Professor Magnolia... It seems she's quite bothered by the chairman's actions, since she helped carry out so much of the researching into Dynamaxing for him.
