Welcome, Gym Challenger! Do you want to attempt the Gym mission?
Of course!
Let me think
Wonderful! Then please use the changing room to change into your uniform, and proceed onward to begin the mission!
Please head on in to pick up the Trap Detector. You'll need it for the Gym mission!
Understood! We hope you will visit us again.
You're here for the Gym mission, right? One of my favorite sayings is "just the tip of the iceberg"!
That uniform looks good on you!
