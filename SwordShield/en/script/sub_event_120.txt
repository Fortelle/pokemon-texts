Hello there? What's this? Did you need something from me? Riiight... Why don't you run along for now, but come back when you're as strong as a Champion, would you?
Well, blow me over! You've become Champion? Now, that's something worth writing home about!
The name's Morimoto. I've been waiting for a strong Trainer like you to come find me.
If you've got faith in your own skill, care to join me in a match?
Is that so? Well, that's a right shame.
What's this? Can't battle if you don't have at least two healthy Pokémon capable of joining in!
That's the ticket! Now watch out! Because Morimoto's got more than enough to motor right over you!
You're really strong! I should've known!
Since you've managed to trounce me, I guess you've earned yourself a reward.
Let's have ourselves a rematch someday!
You seem to keep motoring right over ol' Morimoto. Let's see who wins the next time!
I'm all tuckered out for today. How about tomorrow for a rematch?
And here she is! Ready for that match?
And...go! Awww, I missed again?! It's harder than it looks to get a catch! Hmm? You... You look like you'd know the proper way to throw a Poké Ball!
I'm a planner! My job is think of ways to play, so I suppose that means that playing itself is my job!
Hear that background music? Yup, I made that!
We came here to research a bit. But the Galar region is lovely, isn't it? The best part of all had to be enjoying the different toppings on all the curries. Curry is a big hit in Kanto, too, you know!
Do you like Pokémon?
Well, thanks for that! I hope you'll always love them!
Oh, I get it... You don't just like them. You love them, right?
I'm completely obsessed with Rotom Rally! I can't get enough of it!
