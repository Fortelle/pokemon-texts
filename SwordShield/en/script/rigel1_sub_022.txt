Heeey, <var>! D'you think you could help me out with my training?
<var>...are you perhaps interested in assisting me in my training?
Hee hee, you must be super busy! That's funny, 'cause you really look like you've got nothing better to do...
Hmm. How unfortunate that you would refuse... I shall remember this insult for the rest of my life.
That's what I'm talking about! C'mon, let's go to the Battle Court!
A wise decision. Let us head for the Battle Court.
Whew, as strong as ever! But I think I'm beginning to get it... Hey, thanks for helping me out.
Just as my Future Sight predicted! But I was still able to learn from that battle. Thank you...
Oooh, I didn't expect to win! Maybe I am getting stronger! Still, it could be I just got lucky... Let's do this again, 'K?
An admittedly unexpected victory! Perhaps I released some of my Stored Power? Still, I must become even stronger! I hope you will battle me again sometime.
Oh, I'm done for today! Too much work is bad for my complexion, you know?
I have exhausted too much of my power today. Please come back another time.
