Ah, there you are, <var>! Things are a right proper mess!
Just when I thought the Galar particle count around Turffield had calmed down...
I started getting huge Galar particle readings from Hulbury Stadium and Motostoke Stadium!
So, what exactly happened at Turffield Stadium?
Explain exactly what happened
Exaggerate what happened
What?! A Dynamax Pokémon went on a rampage?
What?! A Dynamax Pokémon completely destroyed the stadium?
Wait... Turffield Stadium is still there.
Huh? Those sword and shield weirdos did it?
Oh! Sonia!
Hm? Hop and...Piers?!
Piers, what are you doing here? Shouldn't you be back in Spikemuth?
I'm an ex-Gym Leader. I can be wherever I want. It's not that weird!
More importantly, you said there were Dynamax Pokémon at other stadiums?
Yes. I'm getting the same readings in other towns as I was from Turffield Stadium.
I'm worried about Marnie!
Ah, but Spikemuth Gym should be OK, right? I'm only seeing readings from Hulbury Stadium and Motostoke Stadium.
Ah... I see.
If Pokémon are being forced to Dynamax and running wild, there's no way I can simply sit by and watch!
What do you say, <var>?
Let's head to one of the stadiums!
I want to chase after those two weirdos!
Heh. That's the spirit, Champion.
Even if we wanna go after them, we don't know where they went...
Leave those sword and shield weirdos to me.
I can poke around the net for sightings of them!
We'll leave the researchin' to this, er... Sonia, was it? We should get to the other stadiums and help out.
I'll catch up to you in a bit, so head out first. I'll leave it up to you to decide which stadium we handle first.
If someone's in trouble, then I want to help! So, let's get out there and do our best. All right, <var>?
Those sword and shield weirdos stick out like a sore thumb. It shouldn't be too hard to find them. Time for a little searching on social media!
