Heya, Gym Challenger! You looked real ace out there during the opening ceremony!
Oh, but where's Hop?
He went on ahead
He went a different way
He can't sit still at all, can he? Guess he really wants to catch up to his brother.
Well, you're rivals, after all. I guess it makes sense you'd train on your own.
Oh, I know! Let me tell you about something a bit interesting.
You see that building over there? It's a company owned by Chairman Rose.
Just past Route 3, there's a mine where they dig up ore. That building over there processes it into energy.
In other words, the chairman is responsible for providing the Galar region with its energy, too.
Can't say I really get him, but the chairman seems like a pretty brilliant guy, right?
Here, a little something for having a chin-wag with me! It's an Escape Rope.
I'll heal up your Pok√©mon, too!
The way to Turffield is pretty long, but that's a kind of challenge in its own right. Good luck, Gym Challenger!
