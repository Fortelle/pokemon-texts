Hang on—I recognize you!
Are you here for a Dynamax Adventure, too? Wicked! Guess we're on the same wavelength!
I'm Peonia. Nice to properly meet you!
What about you? What's your name?
I'm <var>!
Wotcher! Name's <var>!
Wow, what a perfect name for you! It really suits you!
Pffft! That how you always talk? It's not bad!
So is my dad on his way here, too? I haven't seen him... Has he got turned around and wound up back at the entrance?
Listen—sorry for using you to distract my old man back there.
He's as stubborn as a Mudbray! Things go all right after I left?









What? You beat my old man?! You sure pulled a blinder there!
What? You held your own against my old man?!
He used to be a Gym Leader, you know. Even on holiday, he's no pushover!
Y'know, my dad was going mad with excitement for this trip.
He kept going on about how he'd planned for us to check out local legends on this super-intense adventure tour—or "Adven-tour" as he calls it...
But I mean, come on! What girl my age would be caught dead doing some naff thing like that with her dad?
Besides, I really fancy having more battles with Dynamax Pokémon!
Ahhh, the thrill of battling one of those massive, towering Pokémon... Just thinking about it gets me pumped! Hee hee!
You know what? I've just had a thought! You're a pretty fierce Trainer, right?
Then I bet you could handle takin' my place on my old man's Adven-tour!
Sounds like great fun!
Rather not, thanks
Too right it does! It's a brilliant idea, if I do say so myself!
Oh, no need to worry! He'll take good care of you...despite all appearances to the contrary.
He's so hyped up about all this. It'd be a shame to just leave him on his own.
And who knows? You could end up running into a Legendary Pokémon!
How about I meet back up with you two after I've had my own fun in the Max Lair?
Go on, then. Enjoy your twosome tour of legends!
Tell my old man the deal and all that!
