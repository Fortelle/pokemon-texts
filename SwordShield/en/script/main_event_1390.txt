*Ka-BOOM*
<var>! Thanks for coming, but I've got a handle on this! Whatever's making that noise, I'll see to it!
I already told you, didn't I? Keep your eye on the goal! And for you, that's winning the Gym Challenge!
The only Gym Badge left is the one you'll get from the Dragon Gym's Leader, Raihan. Right? Raihan is the only Trainer out there I consider a real rival. He's that good, you know!
And there I go again! Sorry, but I suppose this is no time for me to be stopping for a chat. There's a bit of trouble here with my name on it. But don't you worry about a thing!
The unbeatable Champion is here to look after things and keep you all safe!
*Ka-BOOM*
That came from the tunnel, wouldn't you say? Seems I'm about to have a champion time!
