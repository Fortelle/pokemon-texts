You're welcome to stay at either building of Hotel Ionia.
Hotels are the best. No need to worry about cleaning or laundry or anything.
We've got tickets for the very-front-row seats in the stadium! Sometimes moves can come flying our way, but it's wicked exciting!
I'm waiting for someone... My Noibat's using its ultrasonic waves to help look.
Weeeoooeeeoooeeeooo.
