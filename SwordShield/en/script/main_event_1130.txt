Ah, there you are, my dear Gym Challenger. Though you are really lacking in the color pink.
See, I'm looking for a successor to take on the role of Gym Leader here. So my Gym mission serves as an audition of sorts, too.
Oh, don't worry. It's simple enough. All you need to do is battle my Trainers and answer the questions they ask along the way.
Think carefully before answering, though, child. If you get the wrong answer, the stats of your Pokémon will get lowered. Oh, but if you answer correctly, your Pokémon will get a stat boost. Just think of it as a little Fairy-type Pokémon magic to make things interesting.
Now, I want you to go all out. Show me what you can do!






Now, let the Gym mission begin! Battle with all your skill!
Did you need something?
What was the mission?
I want to withdraw
I'm good
Try to achieve victory while answering the questions given by the Gym Trainers!
If you withdraw, you'll have to start over the next time you give the mission a try. So, are you sure?
Then I look forward to your next attempt!
In that case, good luck!
Enjoying the Gym mission?
Congratulations! You have successfully completed the Gym mission! Now, I wonder if you've met the standards of the Gym Leader. Would you like to immediately challenge the Gym Leader, Challenger <var>?
I'm good to go!
I need some time
Right! Then head on in! Give my regards to the Gym Leader!
Of course. You probably need to save a record of your progress and whatnot.
All right, OK. It's time to start your audition to see if you're worthy of becoming the Fairy-type Gym Leader.
I see... I can't say what Ms. Opal will think, but you've at least piqued my interest.
I'm the second Trainer. Don't worry about the last question. Let's keep moving forward.
Don't worry about right or wrong. Just keep moving forward.
I'm next. I think you might have what it takes to become the Fairy-type Gym Leader.
We should be focusing on the Gym Challenge, but Ms. Opal insisted on making this an audition.
