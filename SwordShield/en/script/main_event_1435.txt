Hey! <var>!
Sorry to hold you up, but there was something I forgot.
First off, as a sign of my respect... Here. TM99. It contains the move Breaking Swipe.
And secondly...here's the Dragon-type Gym uniform, the mark of true strength!
Number <var>, Challenger <var>! You've completed the Gym Challenge! Good on you, kid. Now, prove your strength to the whole region at the Champion Cup!
Raihan! I'm here to see just how good you are!
There you are, Leon's little brother! Don't worryâ€”I'll give you a battle that'll make you want to quit the Gym Challenge altogether!
I've tried out lots of different strategies, and I've made up my mind about how I want to battle. I'm not gonna lose! I'm gonna beat you, and <var>, and even Lee!
I'll be seeing you, <var>! Let's have another epic battle someday! If you're feeling up to it, you might want to go train hard in the Wild Area!
