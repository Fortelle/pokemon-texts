You're here.
So, you've come at last.
When I beat you, I'll get the secret armor...
Defeating you will grant me the secret armor...
and then I'll become a Poison-type Gym Leader!
then I will at last have what I need to become a Psychic-type Gym Leader!
I've got to win, no matter what...
No matter what it takes, I refuse to accept anything but a complete and utter victory...
I'm gonna go all out and totally beat you. You ready?
I'm coming at you with everything I have. Are you prepared?
Huh?! Aw, come on! You're gonna leave me hanging after all that? Well, whatever...
You're going to tell me you're not ready? After all that's been said? Truly, your Nature must be Bold.
Ugh! Don't talk to me until you're ready to battle me!
*sigh*... Please speak with me once you're actually ready for this.
Looks like the two of you are ready.
Good luck!
I'm cheering for both of you!
All right, you two, take your places!
The Master Dojo's final trial...
Ready!
Aaaaaand go!
The victor has been decided!
The one to complete the third trial is... you, <var>!
Hooray! Hooray!
That was amazing!
What a fierce battle!
Oh, well done! You both gave it your all!
Aw man... I totally lost...
It appears...I have lost.
Hah, well, this stinks. I do everything—even cheat a little—and still lose.
Heh, how pathetic. I lost even though I resorted to such underhanded tactics.
I don't expect a young, talented kid like you to really get it, but...
I don't think young, capable children like you can understand how I feel.
I...really was trying, you know? As hard as I could...
I am just an average man who gave everything he possibly could...
Maybe it's time for me to just give up on my dream of being a Gym Leader...
Perhaps it's time I stopped playing around and gave up my dream of being a Gym Leader...
Once they find out what I did, I'll be expelled from the dojo anyway.
After the less-than-reputable things I did, I'm likely to be expelled from the dojo.
<var>, you can tell the master that I cheated.
<var>, you are free to tell the master about the awful things I did.
OK
I won't
I'm sorry...
Sorry for what I did...
Huh? B-but why? It was supposed to be a fair battle, and I cheated just so I could win...
Wh-what are you saying? But I turned to the shadows like a Dark type to try to win!
Oh, no need to tell me... You can't hide anything from little old me!
That's your strength, <var>. Kindness toward both your Pokémon and your rivals!
M-Master?!
M-Master?!
I should apologize on Klara's behalf, too, as her master.
I should apologize on Avery's behalf, too, as his master.
What she did was wrong, but...
What he did was wrong, but...
she just didn't want to be beaten by her rival— that's all. She's a good, hardworking student.
he just didn't want to be beaten by his rival— that's all. He's a good, hardworking student.
*hic* *sniff* Master...thank you... I'm sorry, <var>...
*sniff* Master...I thank you... You have my apologies, <var>.
As for your punishment, Klara, you're going to look after the Pokémon in the dojo for six months...by yourself!
As for your punishment, Avery, you're going to look after the Pokémon in the dojo for six months...by yourself!
What?! I mean, yeah, that's a lot of work, but... is that all?!
What?! Is that all I have to do? And you'll forgive me?
Of course! Let's work on strengthening your heart!
O-OK!
O-OK!
All right, everyone! Things are settled here!
I'm so proud of you both! You mustered so much effort and tried so hard!
I got so teared up that I couldn't even see half the battle, but what I saw was amazing!
So moving!
I'm tearing up!
<var>!
You gave it your best and triumphed, even when faced with an unfair challenge.
To you, who has completed all the trials...
I grant the secret armor of the Master Dojo!
It'll take some time to prepare, so I'll go ahead and get things sorted.
And that's all, gang! As you were!
<var>!
Pardon me. Um...
Um! I... Well...
<var>, I...
You're...really strong!
I will admit to acknowledging your strength just a little.
H-hey! Don't just ignore me!
Ignoring me and leaving first... Is your Nature Hasty?
Wow! You're going to get the secret armor! What kind of armor do you think it is?
*sniff* Klara... She did her best...
*sniff* Avery... He did his best...
You were really, really great!
The last trial was just an ordinary Pokémon battle... I guess the master wanted a pure show of skill and strength?
What did the master tell you after your battle?
You're really strong! I bet you'd really rake it in if you opened your own dojo, huh?
What an amazing battle! Klara did great, too!
What an amazing battle! Avery did great, too!
I thought I saw the Battle Court light up at the start of the battle. Maybe it was just my imagination...
I'd be honored to meet you on the field of battle someday.
Congrats! You were so cool!
One day...I'd like to be strong like you.
One day I hope to be as strong as... No, never mind. Use Amnesia and forget what I just said.
Everyone's happy to win something, aren't they? But losing is also something to be valued. It's the fuel that propels you to growth. Know what I mean, love?
