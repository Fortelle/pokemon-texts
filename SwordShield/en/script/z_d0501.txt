Why does Spikemuth have its shutter down? Are they having a party in there?
What's this? The earth is shaking?! Maybe if I try to sway in the same way... Nope, not helping!

The Gym Leader of Spikemuth, Piers, specializes in Dark-type Pokémon. He's a decent bloke, though.
That cape with all the logos... Was that the Champion running by?!
With the shutter down, nobody's going to be able to attempt the Gym Challenge.
I hope everything is OK in Hammerlocke...
All this red light! Is it Dynamax light?
How? How can wild Pokémon Dynamax when we're nowhere near a Power Spot?
The Champion and Charizard are superheroes!
Oh, I know! The geoglyph! This is a replica of the geoglyph on the hill!
Wh-what's with all this c-crazy sh-shaking?!
Leon?!
Why is there a wild Dynamax Pokémon here?
What is this red light...?
