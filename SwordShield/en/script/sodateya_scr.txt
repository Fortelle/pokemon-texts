Welcome to the Nursery. How may I help you?
Nice to see a new face around here. This is a Pokémon Nursery. We take care of people's Pokémon here. When people leave two Pokémon with us, we sometimes find Eggs. If you're interested in that sort of thing, ask the old lady inside to tell you more. Do you want to leave any Pokémon with me?
Do come back soon.
We found your Pokémon holding an Egg. Would you like to take it?
Is that so? In that case, we'll keep it ourselves.
You received an Egg from the Nursery worker!
Take good care of it, and raise it well.
It looks like your Boxes are all full. Have a look at them and come again, won't you?
<var> is doing just fine.
Your <var> and <var> are doing just fine. They really seem to enjoy each other's company.
Your <var> and <var> are doing just fine. They seem to get along all right.
Your <var> and <var> are doing just fine. Though... They don't seem very fond of one another.
Your <var> and <var> are doing just fine. Though... They don't seem to like playing together at all...
I'm afraid you'd be left with too few Pokémon if I took any from you now.
You can leave up to two Pokémon with us. Which Pokémon should we look after?
We're looking after <var> now. Which other Pokémon would you like us to take?
It will cost ₽1,000 to leave two Pokémon. Would you like to leave them both?
It will cost ₽500 to leave one Pokémon. Would you like to leave your Pokémon with me?
That will be an additional ₽500, please.
Then you can trust us with both <var> and <var>! I'll take fine care of them.
Then leave <var> with me.
Whenever you want to collect your Pokémon, do let me know.
You don't seem to have enough money...
Things are going just fine. Would you like to take your Pokémon back anyway?
Just a moment, then. I'll go get your <var>.

Would you care to take <var>, too?
You don't have many Pokémon in your party, so I can only take one from you just now.

Hello! This here is the Wild Area branch of the Pokémon Nursery! We're just as capable as the Nursery on Route 5. Don't you worry about a thing! Will you be leaving any Pokémon with us today?
Come again!

I'm a Pokémon Nursery lady. I help take care of the Pokémon of Trainers like you. Lately, for some reason, I see some Pokémon holding Eggs. It's mysterious, isn't it? If you want us to take care of your Pokémon, please speak to my sister inside the building.
Alola! <var> is doing just fine!
Alola, Champion! <var> is doing just fine!
Alola! <var> and <var> are doing just fine! They really seem to like hanging out!

Oh hey! I have surprising news for you! Your Pokémon was holding an Egg! It's like a total mystery where it came from, but you want the Egg your Pokémon was holding, right?
You received the Egg from the Pokémon Nursery lady.
Please take good care of it!
Oh, your party is full... Please come back again after making space for the Egg.
I'll keep it if you don't want it, but you want it, don't you?
Then I'll take it. Thank you.
Hi, I'm a Pokémon Nursery lady. We can take up to two of your Pokémon.
Hi, I'm a Pokémon Nursery lady. What would you like to do?
Hi, I'm a Pokémon Nursery lady. Champion, what would you like to do?
OK. Come back another time.
Oh, my little sister was looking for you!
If you leave the Pokémon with me, you won't be able to battle. Please come back again with more Pokémon.
Which Pokémon shall I take care of?
Don't be silly. That's an Egg!
All right. I'll take care of your <var> for a while.
Come back again after a while.
We can take up to two of your Pokémon. Would you like to leave one more Pokémon?
You have very energetic Pokémon, don't you? Do you want to take one back?

If you want your <var> back now, it will cost you ₽<var>.
You don't seem to have enough money...
You took back your <var> from the Pokémon Nursery lady.
Do you want to take the other one back, too?
Oh... If you leave a Pokémon with me, you'll be left with only the one. Catch some more Pokémon and come back.
Your party is full! Make room, and then come see me again.
I'd like to leave Pokémon
I'd like to take my Pokémon back
