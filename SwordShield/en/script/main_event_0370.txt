Look at that!
That's Motostoke, way off that way!
And between there and here are countless new Pokémon waiting to be met!
Oh, hello. And if it isn't Sonia.
My gran gave me a proper earful, in her own way... "Those two young Trainers are setting out on a journey, but what are you doing with your life?"
That sounds rough
Ouch, Professor...
Ah... Never you mind that! Nothing to worry yourselves over! Besides, I'd been quite curious about that Pokémon you two met in the forest. I'd been thinking I should look into it, so the timing works out fine!
If I discover something really huge, then maybe even Gran'll admit I've got some talent!
Yikes... Being an adult has got its own challenges, eh?
I said you needn't worry about it! I'm glad to be on the road. Really! It's been ages. It'll be great fun to fish and camp and rough it outside again.




Well, I'm off to go stick my head in as many of those red glowing dens as I can find. I'm going to battle the snot out of a bunch of Dynamax Pokémon and fill in another page in the tale of my legend!
What cheek! Dynamax Pokémon are really on another level, you know! You'd better Dynamax your partner Pokémon, too, if you want to take on opponents that strong!
You'll find spots here and there in the Wild Area that emit a red beam of light. If you think you're up to it, check them out. There'll be Dynamax Pokémon lurking inside! So with that, how about I send you off with a little treat from me?
With a Pokémon Box Link, you'll be able to put Pokémon from your team into your Boxes or take Pokémon from your Boxes to add them to your team. Nice, right? So go wild catching as many Pokémon as you like, and fill in some more of your Pokédex!
The Wild Area is waiting for you! This is the start of your real adventure!
