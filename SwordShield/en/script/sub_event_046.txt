Oh... Champion. I never thought I'd run into you in the mines.
I've been doing some voluntary community service on Mr. Rose's behalf.
Mr. Rose... A long time ago he used to work in a coal mine, you know. That's why I'm actually happy with doing this kind of work. Yes! I'm so happy, I think I'll give you one of my prized League Cards!
You don't need to worry... I have a hundred copies of Mr. Rose's League Card. They're all signed, too!
Champion... Thank you for stopping Eternatus. I know Mr. Rose feels the same way... But he was just so worried about the future...
