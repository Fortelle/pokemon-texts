Hello. People call me Digging Ma. Have you met Digging Pa? He's my partner.
I enjoy digging and the thrill of digging with my lovely shovel. It's my digging friend.
I feel like giving you a piece of Armorite Ore to commemorate our meeting...
But, no! I'll give you a chance to choose! You could receive the piece of Armorite Ore... or you could use it as payment to have me dig to see if I can find even more Armorite Ore!
However! If my lovely shovel breaks while I'm digging, you won't get anything...
I do need to ask you to quickly save your progress first, but if you are seeking some thrills, why not try your luck with me?


Digging always comes with risks... It's unavoidable. Brace yourself...

I'm looking forward to when you're ready for a game of your lifetime!
Here I go!
Aah... Sorry! I hit a hard rock, and my lovely shovel broke.
The Armorite Ore you were supposed to get is gone...
Such is life! Anyway, see you again somewhere!
I dug up <var> pieces of Armorite Ore.

If I stop now, you'll get <var> pieces of Armorite Ore!







Shall I keep digging?
Hehehe! Quitting also takes courage. It might be a very wise decision!

Hmm? Wait... Wait!
My lovely shovel is whispering that it still wants to dig!
Second wind! Here I go!
Yaaah!

I'll give you the Armorite Ore as I promised, then.
I'm Digging Maâ€” Oh, we meet again.











Then see you again somewhere, you lucky Trainer!
Hi! Nice to see you again! I feel like giving you a piece of Armorite Ore to commemorate our reunion...
