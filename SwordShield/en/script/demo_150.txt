It probably goes without saying, but... hello, Galar! I'm your Champion, Leon!
The chairman is tied up with some business, so I hope no one minds me stepping in on his behalf...
in order to lead you all to greater heights as Pok√©mon Trainers of the Galar region!
The time has come for you to battle it out until only the greatest challenger remains!
So, on behalf of the chairman, allow me to say... let the Finals matches begin!
