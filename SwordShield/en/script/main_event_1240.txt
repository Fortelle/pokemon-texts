Welcome, Gym Challenger. Do you want to attempt the Gym mission?
Of course!
Let me think
If you want to attempt the mission, then you'll need to change into your uniform. The dressing room's that way.
Make sure to receive the Trap Detector up ahead, too. You'll need it for the Gym mission.
There may be some things you can't overcome without pushing yourself at least a little.
You're here for the Gym mission, right? One of my favorite sayings is "determination will move mountains"!
You look smashing in that uniform!
