Why, hello there! I'm just someone who makes it so that you can use Pokémon brought over from other regions in Ranked Battles!
But! In order for them to participate in Ranked Battles, they'll need to forget all their moves and learn new ones that can be used in Ranked Battles instead!
Do you have Pokémon from other regions that you would like to have participate in Ranked Battles?
So then, which Pokémon would you like to have participate in Ranked Battles?
<var> will need to forget all the moves it knows and learn new ones that it can use in Ranked Battles. Is that OK?
They won't be able to recall any rare moves that they know right now. Are you sure you're OK with that?
Oh, it looks like <var> is ready to participate in Ranked Battles already! Isn't that just grand?
All right! Then let the lesson begin!
Now <var> is all ready for Ranked Battles!
See you again sometime!
