<var>, you look a little more Champion-like, huh? Only a little, though.
What're you gawkin' at? It's exactly what you think. I look wicked as a Gym Leader, right?
I wanna show everyone that even if you can't Dynamax, you can still use other tactics and have a lot of fun!
C'mon, Champ! How 'bout an exhibition match?
Of course!
Now's not a good time
Don't get the wrong idea! This ain't you usin' me for trainin'. I'm usin' you for trainin'â€”got it?
Sure, that's it. Spikemuth's my home turf, after all. It's only natural you'd feel nervous.
As expected. You're a proper Champion, ain'tcha, <var>?
OK! I'm gonna give you somethin' important. So keep it safe or I'll get mad, got it?
Come back any time you're free. I don't mind trainin' against you.
Just couldn't stay away, eh, <var>? Guess it can't be helped. Shall I beat you hollow?
If I'm not good enough to beat you yet, that means I definitely can't go sayin' I've surpassed my bro!
Battling the Champion sure is excitin'! Be sure to come back again, OK? Morpeko and I will be waitin'.
