Uhhh, Challenger <var>, right? Out givin' it your all, even this late, huh?
Hey, help with somethin' for a sec. I want t'see if I'm ready for the next leg of the Gym Challenge.
All right
Ugh, really...
Oi! Don't clear off just yet!
We're havin' a battle before you go back to your room!
Wicked! Got some fight in you, huh?
Oi! That won't do! Show me your fightin' spirit.

Guess I'd better get to bed and rest up for tomorrow. You'd better get to sleep, too.
Urara!
