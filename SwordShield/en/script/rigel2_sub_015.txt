Over and under, over and under... Galarica Twigs go all around... Until we've crafted nature's crown... A wreath of twigs is what we've wound...
If you give me <var> Galarica Twigs, I'll weave a Galarica Wreath for you.
That's a real shame. These wreaths are just about the coolest headgear you can find.
You don't have enough Galarica Twigs. Walk around the Crown Tundra, and try to gather up some more.
Righty-o. Leave it to me.
Over, under, around we go... Over, under, in the snow...
Here you are. A brand new wreath for you.
It looks very fetching on a Slowpoke. If you want me to make more, I'd be happy to. Just bring me some more Galarica Twigs.
Oh, look at that fine Slowking! So you put that Galarica Wreath on it, did you? Then I guess I had better give you this shirt, too.
Oh, look at that fine Slowking! The Slowking you find in other regions also have a noble air to them, don't they?
This smashing design would fit right in at any party, don't you think?
You got <var> <var>!
