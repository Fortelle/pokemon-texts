Lil...
Lilli?
We've got your Petilil!
Have you lost a Petilil?!
Liiigant!
Lilligant wants to follow you!
Lead it to where Hop and Petilil are waiting!
Finally, <var>! And you found Lilligant!
Lilliii!
Tilil!
Hehe, looks like they're both pretty happy to see each other.
Gant tu!
What d'ya think, <var>? I'd say Lilligant is trying to thank you.
Lili!
Huh? Is this...some of the nectar from your flower, Lilligant?
Gant tuuu!
Til lil!
See ya, Petilil! See ya, Lilligant!
Nice one, <var>! Now we've got some of Lilligant's nectar!
Hopefully this nectar's sweet and sticky, just like Urshifu likes it...
*sluuurp*
Hrmmm... I definitely wouldn't call it very sticky. It's pretty watery...
I don't think this is what you need, mate, but at least we did a good deed anyway.
Come on! Let's give Applin's nectar a try next!
Oh, you brought Lilligant? Er... No, you definitely did not. Did you lose it along the way, maybe? Go find it! My feet are falling asleep here!
