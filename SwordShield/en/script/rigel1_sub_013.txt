Hi-yah! <var>! Do you want to try Restricted Sparring?
Yes
Tell me how it works
No thanks
No, I'll quit
Select the type you want to use for sparring.
I won't force you to do anything you don't want to do. Some other time, then.
Restricted Sparring is a training course that restricts the type of Pokémon you can use. Select a type first, and then battle using up to three Pokémon of that type. No duplicate Pokémon or items are allowed. If you can win five times in a row, you'll complete the training. However, if you lose even once, the sparring will end there! You can restore your Pokémon between battles, but only twice in total, so use the opportunities very wisely. That's all! Do you want to try Restricted Sparring?
Oh, you changed your mind? Some other time, then.
Let the battles begin! Battle No. 1! Ready...
Next. Battle No. <var>! Ready...

Go!
Well done!
Do you want to restore your Pokémon? (You can restore them <var> more times.)
You lost...but train yourself and your Pokémon, and try again! I'm looking forward to your next challenge.
Your result for this Restricted Sparring set is... You had <var> victoryies with the <var>-type Pokémon restriction!
The way you handle <var>-type Pokémon is flawless!
To recognize your untiring efforts, I'll give this to you.
I hope you'll try to complete the training with other types, too!
What?! You completed Restricted Sparring with all types?!
I can't believe it... Your achievement is just phenomenal!
This accomplishment is sure to go down in dojo history! To commemorate this monumental achievement, I'll grant you the right to wear this outfit!
I hope you'll keep exceeding your own limits!
Do you want to continue sparring?
Yes, I'll have my Pokémon restored and continue
Yes, I'll continue
Do you want to continue sparring? (You can restore your Pokémon <var> more times.)
You earned <var> BP!
You got <var> <var>!
