Hey, Mr. Station Master! Isn't this the Wild Area? What're we stopped here for?
Yes... This is the Wild Area Station, make no mistake. I'm sorry to tell you that the train is halted, due to a flock of Wooloo on the tracks.
What's there to be sorry about? This is brilliant!
Brilliant?
What is?
This Wild Area is massive! There are loads of Pokémon to battle here! You get it, don't you, <var>? This is the best possible place to put together the greatest team!
We can get you back to Wedgehurst, if you like. But Motostoke is off the menu for now. It wouldn't be very decent of us to try to drive off those Pokémon just because we happen to want to run our train here, now would it?
