So? Does my Exp. Charm seem to be working as intended?
What is this thing? Some sort of machine made out of junk parts to look like...a Pokémon?
You like it?
Hmph. You wouldn't get it anyway.
Heh. I thought you might be the type.
That's my Cram-o-matic, and—just to be clear— it's the invention of the century.
It's my very own brilliant take on recycling.
Though it doesn't do a thing right now, since it's out of power...
If I just had enough Watts... But Mummy won't give me any more of hers...
All it would take is a measly 500 W to get the Cram-o-matic up and running, y'know?
I can give you that
That's too bad
Whoa! Seriously?! You'll give me the 500 W I need?!
Do you want to keep going with the same combination of items?
You obtained <var>!
You're lacking one or more items. Ending combination process...
It'd take me ages outdoors to collect 500 W... And the outdoors and me... Well...let's just say, our systems aren't compatible.
But you... Sorry, what was your name again? <var>? I guess you're more the outdoors type, huh?
I'll feed those Watts you gave me into the Cram-o-matic at once, and...
Power! On!
Crrr...
Crrraaa-AAAMMMMMM!
Huhuhu... Perfect. Just perfect.
Put in four items you don't need, and you'll get one new item in exchange.
If you put in four of the Apricorns that grow here on the Isle of Armor, then you might even get a rare Poké Ball...if you're real lucky.
Since you gave me the Watts and all, feel free to use my Cram-o-matic as much as you like.
So if you want <var>...
First you'll want to add <var>...
Then you'll need <var>...
<var>...and ... ... ...
<var>.



Fine, I'll explain how the Cram-o-matic works one more time...
You take four items you don't need, you put 'em in, and then you get one new item. That's it.

Huhuhu... Perfect. Now it's sure to work.
All that's left is to fire it up with the ON button, so...here we go! Let's push it!
Crrrrrr...
... ... ...
Cripes! It powered down.
Must still need more Watts...
What's that, <var>? Did you actually manage to get a rare ball?!
You've got some serious luck. I've run the numbers, and those things are rare.
One of Daddy's friends came here once to make those kinds of balls for him. This real old guy...
He may have been old, but he was good. He could make a rare ball with just one Apricorn.
I tried to observe how he did it and program that into my Cram-o-matic.
But my success rate is still way lower than that old guy could pull off...
But I'll keep improving my tech, until someday, we can replicate the skills of even a master craftsman through the power of science. Just you wait.
Er. I mean. Forget it... I said too much...
Want me to share one of my recipes with you? I can. It'll cost you <var> W. That's all.
Come back when you've collected some Watts.
You don't have enough Watts.
