Will you be heading onto the pitch? The opening ceremony should be starting soon.
I'm ready!
Not yet
Then in you go!
Would you like to speak with the others for one last spot of advice?
I'll always press on and challenge myself so that I can go on as a Pokémon Trainer for as long as possible. As long as you continue to push yourself, your brilliance will never fade.
My first match is against Raihan of all people? What rotten luck... But even if he changes the weather around, I don't plan on throwing in the towel so easy.
Long time no see! This'll be a different sort of battle than you faced in the Gym Challenge. Those were basically test matches, but this... This is serious battle.
It's a curious feeling... My heart is racing a bit, but I still can't wait for the match to begin!
I'll be bringing my matches to an end in a heartbeat—you'll see. No one who sees them will ever forget me.
I'm going to win my way through every round, then I'll be the one taking on Leon! If I don't, then I'll have failed to repay Duraludon and the rest of my team for all their hard work!
I'd say I aim to win this thing... And I'll do it without usin' Dynamax, to help everyone in Spikemuth reclaim their pride... and to see 'em smile once again.
The opening ceremony will begin momentarily. Please head to the pitch at once.
