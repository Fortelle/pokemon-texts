So the reason those red and blue buffoons could make so many Pokémon Dynamax was because they hoarded up so many Wishing Stars...
<var>! We've got to go help all the other places where these Dynamax Pokémon are running wild!
Looks like most of the stadiums have got this Dynamax problem sorted now. Let's keep up the pace, <var>!
Right! I think that's all the stadiums sorted now! We didn't miss any, did we, <var>?


Things'll probably get even tougher from here. We still got three more stadiums where there's some Dynamax Pokémon runnin' wild. Let's up the tempo.
Looks like there's two Pokémon Stadiums left to check.
There's only one Pokémon Stadium with Dynamax trouble left. Let's finish this already.
All that's left is to catch those sword and shield weirdos.
If we don't find them quick, they could just start all this up again!
Wasn't Professor Sonia s'pposed to be lookin' into where those two might be?
And once we find them again, I'm going to take them right down!
*beep beep beep*
That's your Rotom Phone, <var>! It's got to be Sonia!
<var>? It's me! Sonia!
Heh! Called it.
Those sword and shield weirdos got into Hammerlocke Stadium and are headed for the Energy Plant.
The door to the plant's locked, but I think I can get it open. Give me a bit, and you'll be able to get in there!
You hear that? Hammerlocke Stadium. Get over there as soon as you can!
Even over the phone, Sonia sure sounds lively...
We should hurry to Hammerlocke Stadium.
We're already at Hammerlocke Stadium... The door to the Energy Plant should be right down the hall. Guess we should get goin'.
