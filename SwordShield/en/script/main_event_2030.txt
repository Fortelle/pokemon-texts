This is the final match against the Champion. The Championship Match! Are you ready to face Leon?
I'm ready to beat him!
I still need to get ready
Then change into your uniform, and head out onto the pitch!
There's no turning back now!
My matches are always sold out, but this... I've never seen a crowd this wild!
Everyone knows what you did for us this week, <var>... They know you're the one who caught Eternatus and saved the future of the Galar region.
A real hero, who battled alongside the Legendary Pokémon, Zacian and Zamazenta... I couldn't have dreamed of a better challenger to help increase my winning streak!
Oh... And you've even added Eternatus to your party. The greatest challenger along with the most powerful Pokémon—is that it? Now you're really getting me excited!
Now that I've seen just what kind of strength you possess as the greatest of challengers... crushing you into the dirt will show everyone just how strong their Champion truly is!
Come on, <var>! Let's make this a final match that'll go down in Galar's history! No! A match that'll change Galar forever!
We're gonna have an absolutely champion time!
