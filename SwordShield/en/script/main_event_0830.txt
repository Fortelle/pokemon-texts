Hello again, Wild Area, my old friend! I've come back to you even stronger than before!
<var>! Hammerlocke is up that way—got it?
And, yeah, you could certainly rush straight there without a single detour...
but now that you and I have a few Gym Badges, we should be able to catch stronger Pokémon!
So I know what I'm doing. I'll be catching myself some amazing Pokémon to fill in the next page in the tale of my legend!
Don't waste your efforts. It's not like either of you would ever make it through the Gym Challenge, anyway.
The Champion really must have been off his rocker to endorse the likes of you.
I mean, it seems Hop here can't even throw a Poké Ball properly.
Rubbish. More like you don't know enough to recognize greatness when you see it. My throws are the greatest, and my bro is the finest Champion the world has ever seen! I'm not gonna listen to you insulting him!
How tiresome... Fine. I'll battle you over there. Maybe that will help you finally understand just how weak you are.
You're on then. I know you challenged <var> to battle in Galar Mine No. 2 and lost to himer there. And I'm hiser greatest rival. In other words...there's no way you're beating me.
All this prattle about <var> and the Champion and whatnot... Do you not have anything of your own to show?
I'll show this wally my real skills in battle! So, see you later, <var>! Let's meet up in Hammerlocke when I'm through with him!
