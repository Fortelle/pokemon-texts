Hurry it up, <var>!
Huh?
You're the Gym Leader, but you still came all the way to see us off? Oh, I bet you can already tell that I'm the one who'll become the next Champion, yeah?
There are many Trainers who never manage to gather three Gym Badges, and they just give up on the Gym Challenge altogether... So I make a point to see off any Trainers who are able to defeat me.
Whew, we made it... Thank goodness for Flying Taxis!
<var>, Hop, congratulations! It's pretty amazing you two defeated Kabu!
Not a lot of Gym Challengers are able to get a Gym Badge from Kabu. We like to get together to see them off, as a way of showing our support.
So, allow me to send you off with a proper, sporty chant!
Hustle, hustle, hustle, Hop! You can do it, you can do it, <var>!
The Gym Leaders you will face ahead are all tough opponents. But I believe that you will prevail! Believe in your Pokémon and keep pushing on!
Thanks, you all! We're gonna keep winning! We've got to if we want a face-off in the Champion Cup, after all!
Come on, <var>! Let's head for Hammerlocke!
Look into yourself for things you lack. Those who understand their own weaknesses learn and grow the most!
You run into a lot of unexpected things when you work as a farmer. Same thing with Pokémon battles. Just don't give up and things will work out.
There's nothing wrong with stoically facing challenges, but push yourselves too hard, and you'll pop. If you ever feel maxed out, come up for a breather at the seafood restaurant.
