Hey, Chief! My pillow's caught your eye, eh?
Your...pillow?
Yeah, it's great!
Righto! Ultra-mega-nice, isn't it? Just the shape and firmness I need!
Oi, listen here, Chief. I've got some wisdom to impart.
If you can put your head on it and have a kip, it's a pillow!
Unfortunately, I went and left my favorite pillow back at home.
So I went to have a look around town for somethin' to rest my head on... and I found this out back behind the inn!
Can I have it?
I see
I'm in for one ultra-mega-comfy sleep tonight. That's for certain!
What's the matter, Chief? Can't get my pillow off your mind?
I was only looking
Heh heh heh! Well, look all you like! Sear it right into your eyeballs!
C-come off it! You want me to hand over my ultra-mega-comfy pillow?!
That's askin' a lot, even comin' from you, Chief!
Hm? What's that?
You think my pillow's got somethin' to do with a Legendary Pokémon?
Gaaah, ultra-mega-seriously?! This is just some old thing I found!
But if you really want it, Chief... Who am I to refuse?
All right, all right! Go on, then—have it!
But you'd better make sure you track that legend down!
