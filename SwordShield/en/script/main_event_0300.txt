<var>! Hop! Well, after seeing a match like that one... I suppose I've little choice but to give you both an endorsement as Champion!
Yes! Thanks, Lee! I swear I'm going to win my way through the Gym Challenge to reach you!
You may both be young still, and plenty rough around the edges, but it was a proper battle. Charizard and I were both feeling the excitement in every last cell in our bodies!
Hop, you've always tended to get caught up in things like how you throw your Poké Ball out... Things that have nothing to do with real strength. Honestly, I'd been worried about you still obsessing over that sort of nonsense, but it seems you really have grown a bit, Little Brother!
And I'd like to see some more thrilling Pokémon battles out of you, too, <var>.
All right, <var>! You and me are going to train up against one another to aim for that Champion's title!
Absolutely!
Against one another?
The more we keep battling against one another, the more our Pokémon will grow.
That's the way of it when you've got a great rival! Just like you've got me, and I've got you!
