Graaawrrr!
I'd surely never make it to the stadium without you to show me the way, partner. Even with a huge old thing like this bang in the middle of the city, I still get lost.
<var>! All right?
One look tells me that you've become a Trainer worthy of that endorsement I gave you! And...yes, I reckon you might even be ready to use this... Here, try giving this to your partner to hold!
You heading for Motostoke Stadium?
I am!
I've got other plans first
You can take that lift up to the city's upper level, if you're headed for the stadium next.
I guess you might want to have a look around the city first. Only don't get lost like I do! When you're ready to visit the stadium, take the lift to get up there!
