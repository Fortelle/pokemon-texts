Raihan's uniform number is 241. I can't help looking for that number whenever I see lockers and whatnot.
I feel bad for saying this, but... I just love watching Raihan lose to Leon. The way he shows his frustration is electrifying!
Did you know that the order in which you progress through the Gym Challenge is decided by how strong each Gym Leader is?
Feeeruuu!
