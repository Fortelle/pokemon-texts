Welcome to Chairman Rose's exclusive space. Here, nearly a thousand feet above the earth!
So, you got through all of the special staff that I had ordered to stop you. I would expect nothing less of the Trainers handpicked by Champion Leon himself.
But I am afraid it is now time for you to go home.
Because...
I will not allow anyone to disturb the great Chairman Rose!
You shall be the first, <var>! If I beat you to pieces, then the Champion will have no one to battle and will thus lose heart. In that state, he will listen to anything the chairman says!
Arghhh! This is inexcusable... What was I thinking... Any Gym Challenger who's made it this far would be no pushover...
Under normal circumstances, I would have tried to delay you further. However, all the necessary Wishing Stars have been collected. Do as you wish. There is nothing to be done now.
Typical <var>! You and <var> are unstoppable!
<var>... Stay on guard...
Everything I did, I did to further the chairman's own goals...
