Can you hear me?
Stay calm and move forward.
Good, good!
Steel your nerves!
Now, enter a world of silver snow!
Trust in yourself and push forward!
Don't rush it.
Only a little farther now. Come on—concentrate!
Oh dear, are you lost?
If you hurry, you'll only end up going in circles.
There's no giving up— not even at the very end!
Splendid, you've done well!
Come on, then. Puff out your chest a bit!
You aren't frozen. See?
