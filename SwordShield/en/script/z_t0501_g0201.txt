Many challengers have already given up their Gym Challenges...but you and your Pokémon have been hanging in there!
I was about to give up, but watching your battle inspired me. I decided I'd keep going!
I'm doing my Gym Challenge while I'm raising my Pokémon, but I may have to change my team members.
I'll learn from the battle you had against the Ghost-type Gym Leader.
You've come all the way to Stow-on-Side. So be sure to win!
Yay! You won! <var>, you're so wicked!
