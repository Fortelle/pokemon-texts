Shut your gob!
Oh, <var>!
Uh... I'm really sorry! The lot from Spikemuth's tellin' me they locked down the city for my sake...
Spikemuth just keeps gettin' worse and worse. And all Piers says is "Don't worry"...
So... So we decided to disguise ourselves as Team Yell and sabotage the other challengers.
We thought, if we could stop the other Gym Challengers from reachin' the Gym, then Ms. Marnie would be the only one to win and make it to the Champion Cup!
And we figured that'd increase the chances of our wonderful Ms. Marnie becomin' the new Champion!
*sigh* That's no way to help someone at all!
<var>, no need to bother with all the preparations, or whatever. Go on in and face the Gym Leader!
Oh man, Ms. Marnie's scoldings go on forever... I remember once she scolded her Morpeko for so long, it practically fell asleep...
I can hear Piers just rockin' away. His Pok√©mon chorus sounds pretty great, too.
I'm gonna be givin' Piers my best yells durin' his battle with you!
