Why, hello there, young man. Are you interested in weather?
Why, hello there, young lady. Are you interested in weather?
Oh, is that so! Well then, let me get started...
If the sunlight is harsh during battle...
Fire-type moves become more powerful, while Water-type moves are weakened!
The sunlight will thaw out any frozen Pokémon, and they'll be immune to being frozen while the weather lasts, too!
Moves that use light, like Solar Beam, can be performed in one turn!
The effects of some other moves also get enhanced, like those of Growth and Synthesis.
Certain moves, like Thunder or Hurricane, become less accurate.
If it's raining during battle...
Water-type moves will become more powerful, while Fire-type moves get weakened!
Moves that use sunlight, like Solar Beam, also get weakened!
Your Pokémon will heal less HP when they use moves like Synthesis or Morning Sun, too.
On the other hand, moves like Thunder or Hurricane will become sure hits!
If it's hailing during battle...
any Pokémon that's not Ice type will take damage every turn!
Moves that use sunlight, like Solar Beam, will get weakened!
Your Pokémon will heal less HP when they use moves like Synthesis or Morning Sun, too.
On the other hand, the move Blizzard will become a sure hit.
If a sandstorm is raging during battle...
Rock-type Pokémon get a boost to their Sp. Def!
Any Pokémon that's not Rock, Ground, or Steel type will take damage every turn!
Moves that use sunlight, like Solar Beam, will get weakened!
Your Pokémon will heal less HP when they use moves like Synthesis or Morning Sun, too.
Whew! I got a little carried away there!
Thanks for listening so politely. Please, take this!
You're the first one to listen to everything I had to say about weather... Here's a little something extra, just as a thank-you!
I've gone and tired myself out. Come back tomorrow if you're interested.
Oh, I see...
