Dum dum dee dee... La la de daaa...
Whew! I guess this is as good a spot as any!
Now then, <var>! And Kubfu! If you want to become stronger...
there are special training grounds just for Kubfu!
Prepare yourselves for the...Towers of Two Fists!
The blue tower is the Tower of Waters!
And the red tower is the Tower of Darkness!
Choose wisely, since you'll only be able to climb one of the two towers.
Kubfu's fighting style will change depending on the tower you choose... And the types it gets will change as well! Think carefully!
Each tower's five stories tall, and each floor has a tough opponent waiting for you. Make sure you level up Kubfu properly before trying to climb up!
You can reach both of the towers by heading through the Forest of Focus.


You might even be able to find a shortcut if you can ride your bike across the river!
I'm really looking forward to when you two make it to the top of one of those towers! It's going to be so exciting!
The Towers of Two Fists were made specially for Kubfu to train in to help it grow. Pick either the Tower of Waters or the Tower of Darkness, and try to reach the top!
You need to challenge the Towers of Two Fists, special training grounds for Kubfu!
You really need to have Kubfu with you for this training, though...
It's not too late to find Kubfu though! Come here together so you can start your training!
