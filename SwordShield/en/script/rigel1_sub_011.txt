Di... Digleeet!
Oh! Diglett! You're here!
Hahaha! You little rascal! I was worried about you!
Dig!
Thank you for finding my Diglett.
Is that a Diglett?
Is it from Alola?
This is a Diglett from the Alola region!
It's a regional form. That means it has a different appearance, because it's from a different region!
Oh! I didn't expect to meet someone who knows about it!
That's right! This is a Diglett from the Alola region.
When I traveled in Alola, I fell in love with these adorable three hairs.
I caught a lot of Diglett there and came back. But they went somewhere when I looked away for a second...
Digleee!
Anyway, you found a Diglett buried in the ground...
You definitely have a talent for finding Diglett!
If it's OK, will you find all the other Diglett, too?
Oh, what a kind person you are! Words can't express how grateful I am!
Don't worry. It's not that hard. During your adventure, all you have to do is find tufts of three hairs and speak to them.
You've found <var> Diglett so far, so please find <var> more Diglett.
If you find them, please tell them to come back to me.
If you find the last one, please tell it to come back to me.
Oh! Hello!
Thanks to you, <var> more Diglett came back to me!
One of them has evolved into Dugtrio...
If you find those three hairs again, please tell them to come back to me!
I'm so happy that a lot of Diglett came back. So...
I'd like to give this Pokémon to you!
I met this Pokémon in Alola—just like my Diglett!
I'd like to give this item to you!
Ah... Including the one that just came back, the number of Diglett that have come back is...
Wha—? All 151 Diglett came back?!
Thank you so much! Thanks to you, all my Diglett have come back!
Dispec!
I think this Diglett is saying that you're worthy of its respect, because you found them all.
Dugether!
What? You want to go together with this Trainer, because you respect himer?
Diii!
Hmmm. I feel a bit sad, but...
if that's what it wants, I'll respect its wish!
Please take good care of Diglett.
Diglett became your Pokémon!
How is your Diglett? My Diglett and I are having a blast 'cause I still have 150 of them.
