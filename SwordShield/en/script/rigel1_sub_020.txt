Beeep! Bzzzrp!
You like it?
Hmph. You wouldn't get it anyway.
Heh. I thought you might be the type.
That's Porygon, a Virtual Pokémon, in the flesh— Er...in the code.
Just imagine, a being brought to life using the pinnacle of scientific capabilities,
making it basically the ultimate crystallization of technological progress!
It was designed ages ago now, which explains all its straight lines and angles.
But that's just what gives it that retro feeling enthusiasts can't get enough of.
And you can have it evolve into Porygon2 if you trade it with someone while
Porygon's holding an Upgrade. Its smooth, rounded design is top-notch, too!
You get it? This Pokémon captures the entirety of human advancement and progress!
Er...so...anyway, you can have it. Hardly anyone ever beats Daddy at his full strength, after all.
Cherish that Porygon. It'll give you a better appreciation for human ingenuity if you do.
