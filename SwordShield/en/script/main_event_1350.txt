*sigh*... So you're finally here, huh?
See, I'm...I'm really not a great Gym Leader. Figured that's why nobody was comin' to challenge me.
I have good ears, so I overheard the whole thing about the city bein' shut up. When I was alone, it was like my soul was weepin'.
This is a simple Gym Stadium. We can't even Dynamax our Pokémon, but well... I still hope you enjoy the battle.
Now then...
I'm the Gym Leader of Spikemuth, Piers, the Dark-type user!
You wanna challenge me, even though you know you'll lose? Then this song's for you, foolish Trainer!
Get ready for a mosh pit with me and my party! Spikemuth, it's time to rock!
I'm glad we were able to battle. Seems like my Pokémon feel the same way.
Here's your Dark Badge.
You can now catch Pokémon of up to Lv. 55!
Here's a uniform, too... I've actually been thinkin' about just sellin' them at my concerts.
My little sis Marnie's gonna challenge me next, I bet.
Do you want to go back to the reception area?
