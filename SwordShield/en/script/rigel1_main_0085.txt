Hey, <var>! My bad, my bad!
It just dawned on me that you're brand-new to the Isle of Armor!
I bet you have no idea where to even begin looking for Max Mushrooms!
C'monâ€”let's go for a walk, and I'll show you some mushroom hot spots.
Dum dum dee dee... La la de daaa...
Now, usually the Forest of Focus is chock-full of Max Mushrooms.
But the thing is, a swarm of Greedent came through and ate every last one here!
So I'm thinking maybe you'll have more luck finding Max Mushrooms if you go check Warm-Up Tunnel. It's out on the other side of the forest!
Just watch where you're going in the forest, 'K? It's easy to get lost!
Anyhoo... Good luck with the hunt for Max Mushrooms! Catch you back at the dojo!
Hey, Max Mushrooms! Oh, it's only you, <var>... Sheesh! Don't confuse me like that!
I've searched the Forest of Focus high and low, but there's no sign of any Max Mushrooms... Could they be growing somewhere else?
Blast! I've gotten disoriented! Warm-Up Tunnel isn't this way!
I don't think there are any Max Mushrooms this way. I need to hone my sense of direction!
I want to get to the Training Lowlands, but this isn't the right way to go...
If I brought back Foongus instead of Max Mushrooms, d'you think they'd notice?
