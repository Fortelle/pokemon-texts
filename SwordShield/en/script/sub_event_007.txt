Oho... I see you've become the Champion. Then I can now have your Lv. 100 Pokémon undergo Hyper Training.
What's this? Seems you don't have any Bottle Caps or Gold Bottle Caps.
Now, which Pokémon will I have undergo Hyper Training?
If it isn't Lv. 100, it's not hype enough to undergo Hyper Training.
Oh! <var> is already so strong, it doesn't even need any training!
Would you like to use a Bottle Cap or a Gold Bottle Cap?
You want me to hype up all of this Pokémon's stats?
Which stat should I hype up?
<var>: <var>
Quit
The training starts now!
This Pokémon can't be trained any further!
You don't have enough <var>...
Phew... <var> got stronger from the Hyper Training.
Want to keep the hype going with some more Hyper Training?
Shall I stop the Hyper Training?
Come back when you're ready to get hyped for some Hyper Training.
