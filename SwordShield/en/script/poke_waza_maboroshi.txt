It's my solemn duty to teach a move to Mythical Pokémon. Although I'm on vacation, I could teach a move to your Mythical Pokémon. What do you say?
Whoa! Your Pokémon already knows the move I can teach!
What a shame! I could teach a move if you were with Keldeo or Meloetta.
I could teach a move to your Mythical Pokémon. What do you say?
Speak to me again if you change your mind.
Even I can't teach my moves to an Egg!
That Pokémon cannot learn the moves I can teach!
Hmm? That Pokémon already knows the move I can teach!
Hmmm. That Pokémon doesn't seem to have the energy to battle...
<var> learned <var>!
What? <var> is...
<var> has resolved to battle and has changed into Resolute Form!
Please choose a move that will be replaced with <var>.
<var> learned <var>!
One...two...and...ta-da! <var> forgot <var>! And it learned <var> instead!
<var> did not learn <var>.
Which Pokémon do you want me to teach a move to?
