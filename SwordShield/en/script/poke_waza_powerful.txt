Moves that only select Pokémon can learn... They are called ultimate moves. Do you want your Pokémon to learn one of them?
All right. Fair enough. If you want your Pokémon to learn one of my moves, just come back.
Oh, but none of the Pokémon you're with can learn my move! That's too bad!
Which Pokémon should learn my move?
<var> can't learn my move.
An Egg... I can't teach my move to an Egg.
<var> already knows my move.
Which move should be forgotten?
<var> learned <var>!
One...two...and...ta-da! <var> forgot <var>! And it learned <var> instead!
An ultimate move... How you handle its overwhelming destructive power and its aftermath will be the key!
I'm devoting what's left of my life to helping young Trainers grow. I'd like to teach the ultimate moves to as many successors as I can. Is it all right to teach them to your Pokémon, too?
Would it be all right if I taught your Pokémon the ultimate moves?
Young Trainer, the Pokémon with you can't learn these moves. Please thoroughly check the list of Pokémon that can learn these moves.
Young Trainer, feel free to come visit me any time you want.
Well, please tell me which Pokémon I should teach.
Young Trainer, that Pokémon can't learn an ultimate move. Please thoroughly check the list of Pokémon that can learn these moves.
Young Trainer, I can't teach a move to an Egg.
Young Trainer, that Pokémon's bond with you is not yet strong enough. It can learn the move once it forms a strong bond with you.
Young Trainer, that Pokémon already knows the ultimate move.
