Lovely to see you, Champion! What would you like to do today?

Thanks for stopping by! I hope we'll see you again soon!
Ah. Dear me... It looks as though you're shy on cash, love.

All right! Then let's have you in a chair. I'll take your Bag and things, too.





Now then! What kind of look did you want today?















All done! Thanks for your patience. You look fresher than a mint!

Nothing
































Oh, I've gone ahead and tucked your hat into your Bag, since you can't wear it with this look.
Would you like to put your hat back on or...?
I'll wear it
Leave it off
Then on we go! I think it'll look good with your hat on as well.
Then I'll just tuck the hat you were wearing back into your Bag, darling.
Do you want to reprint your Pokémon League Card, too?
Hang on, love! That card you've got there... Is that a Style Card?!
That's the rarest of the rare, that is! Only the chicest of the chic in all Galar carry one!
I'll let you in on our latest, trendiest looks, you ultrafabulous fashionista! On that note...
