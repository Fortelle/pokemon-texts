Where...? Where are you?
Where, oh where, could you be, my...?
Ms. Oleana?!
A ghost?!
Oh my. Champion? I didn't expect to find you here.
I beg your pardon? There is no ghost here— only a now-mildly-peeved Oleana.
But what a stroke of luck. You may just have the information I need.
Word has reached me that Chairman Rose has supposedly been seen in these parts.
I know full well that cannot be true, but I could not help but come and investigate.
Would you happen to know anything about Mr. Rose somehow being here in this tundra?
I think I might...
Sorry, I don't
You do?! What do you know? Tell me straightaway!
No, I suppose you would not. Things are never as simple as that...
Hey hey, Chief! What brings you here in the dead of night?
M-Mr. Rose?!
Come off it! Me? Rose?! Talk about a mix-up!
You... You're not Mr. Rose at all!
But there is a slight resemblance. Could you be Mr. Rose's...?
Looking closely, I can see you do indeed lack his intelligence and grace... Not that a particularly close look is needed.
Oi, Chief. Do you know this joker?
*gasp* Does this mean the "Mr. Rose" seen here was...?
...
I am now one extremely peeved Oleana!
You may be Mr. Rose's brother, but ultimately, you and he are nothing alike!
Well, now that I know Mr. Rose is not here, I see no reason to linger.
Farewell, Champion. And likewise to...that man over there.
Hello? Have I reached the Flying Taxi service? I need a pickup from the Crown Tundra, please.
Well, that sure was something!
Still...even a bloke like him can inspire that much loyalty, eh?
Hm? Oh, I'm just talkin' to myself here! Don't mind me!
Well, better pack it in for the night before we get spirited away by some ghost Pokémon!
Gahahaha! Nah, just havin' a laugh! Cheers, Chief!
