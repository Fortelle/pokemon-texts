Oh, <var>!
Someone saw those sword and shield weirdos! They said they got through the door!
But the door's closed with an electric lock. Opening it might take some time...
Bow wark!
I'll work on getting the door to the roof open. Can you take care of what's going on in the stadiums, <var>?
Whaâ€”? You're back already? Hold on a moment! I think I've almost got it... Huh? That's strange...
Yamp! Yamp!
What?! It...it opened?!
Yamper! I should've known! Thanks for your help!
Nuphunnn!
Those two weird guys are probably up ahead. Be careful!
Zzzap!
