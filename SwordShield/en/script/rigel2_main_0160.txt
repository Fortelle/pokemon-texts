Would you believe it? I caught myself fallin' asleep outside again!
I was chilled to the bone, so I thought I'd warm myself up with a good, hot shower at our base. But the water comin' out was ice cold!
I got ultra-mega-surprised and jumped out without putting on any of myâ€”
Mlerrrgh...
Human child! Were you able to make the Reins of Unity?
You bet!
Chief Peony did!
Oh joy! What glorious news!
Indeed? This man has done so much to aid me... I do hope I can repay him sometime.
I have some good news of my own. I was finally able to track down my loyal steed!
Glastrier is making its home in the Crown Shrine! It is a place where my loyal steed and I spent much time together!
Spectrier is making its home in the Crown Shrine! It is a place where my loyal steed and I spent much time together!
I had been avoiding the place, as I feared I would get trapped in mine own nostalgia...
Why has my loyal steed made the shrine its home? Is it reminiscing about our time together? No, it can't be.
The Crown Shrine stands majestically atop the mountain to the north.
Bring the carrot and the Reins of Unity, and meet me there.
I shall hasten there now, but you may come when you feel you are ready!
I am counting on you, child...
I'm afraid we don't have much to offer you, but you're welcome to stay for as long as you'd like.
There are a few strange ruins you can find in the Crown Tundra. But the doors won't budge, whether you push or pull on them!
Head east from the Giant's Bed and climb up the mountain to the north, and you'll find an old shrine sitting there.
Be very careful if you're going to climb the mountain, you hear? The path to the summit is long and treacherous.
Isn't my Spheal just the roundest thing ever?
I suppose it's about time I repaired the shower in the village inn...
