Anyone would want to wear the same uniform as their favorite Gym Leader!
Even if your Pokémon are doing just fine, there's nothing wrong with setting up your tent and having a little cookout!
If your Pokémon are a bit low on energy, set up your tent and give them some food!
Camping with your Pokémon, playing together, cooking together... these are all great ways to become closer with your Pokémon. You're welcome to stop by my camp, too, if you'd like!
