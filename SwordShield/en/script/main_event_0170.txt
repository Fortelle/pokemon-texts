Hop! <var>!
Wha—? Lee? How'd you manage to find your way here? You're pants with directions. You always get lost.
Oh, that's nice to hear from the little brother who had me worried sick! I'd been waiting ages for you two, and you never showed! Of course I came looking for the both of you!
Wait, where's the Wooloo?! We were trying to rescue that Wooloo!
Meh!
The little chap's just fine. Though all of you had fainted by the time I found you here. You know this place is out of bounds... But it took courage to come in here all the same. And I can understand well enough why you did it. You did good, Hop!
And at least that Wooloo's all right... Yeah, <var>? I thought we'd had it when that weird fog started rolling in and that mad Pokémon attacked... but at least it wasn't all for nothing!
Attacked by some mad Pokémon? What are you talking about, Hop?
It seemed loads stronger than any Pokémon I've ever seen. And it just had this sort of presence... Our moves didn't even touch it. I mean, really— they seemed to pass right through it!
Your moves passed right through it? So, the fearsome Pokémon they say live in the Slumbering Weald... Are they actually illusions or something?
Get strong enough and maybe the two of you could be the ones to reveal the truth someday.
For now, let's simply get out of this place. You'll be all right now that I'm here with you!
Even if we did get an earful from Lee...
what an experience! This'll make a pretty fine first page in the tale of my legend!
