Lilligant's nectar wasn't it... Applin's nectar wasn't it...
They weren't really sticky enough to be the sticky honey that Urshifu loves...
Come to think of it, they aren't really honey at all, are they?
I was thinking nectar and honey were the same thing, so I was looking for plants and flowers. But was I just barking up the wrong tree?
Pede.
Whoa, a Venipede! I don't see one of those every day!
It's cute looking, right? But it can produce a really thick, gooey poison inside its body—making it pretty dangerous.
Th...that's it!
I was stuck on Pokémon that produce nectar... But what we really need is a Pokémon that USES that sort of nectar to produce something else!
Something like honey?!
You just noticed?!
Yes!
And when it comes to Pokémon that collect and store up lots of nectar to make honey... well, the answer is obvious, right?
Sheep Pokémon!
Beehive Pokémon!
Er, no, that'd be Wooloo. It might eat grass, but it can't produce honey...
The Beehive Pokémon has got to be the answer! I'm sure of it this time!
And Vespiquen is the Beehive Pokémon, right, <var>? Have you ever seen one?
If we're talking about the Isle of Armor...
I think we should find some on the island shaped like a honeycomb over near that big blue tower!
Now that we know where we're going, I'm off! Don't make me wait, <var>!
