What an ideal matchup for letting both of us show our strength.
Agreed. We couldn't have asked for better opponents.
I will press onward toward victory with every ounce of strength in my body and soul!
Between us, we make a monolith that won't easily be crushed!
Well, just look who we're up against! Now, Champion, no hard feelings when we win!
I...I'm not so g-great with Multi Battles...
Allister! No whining! Now's the time to stand tallâ€”understood?
I'll...I'll try my best.
These two aren't the types of opponents we can afford to take lightly... But we're no strangers to bringing our A game! We can do this, mate!
Pretty odd team they make, isn't it? Still, they could turn out to be a good combo in their own right...
Fighting types make a pretty rough matchup for me... Can I just leave 'em to you, <var>?
I'm right at home takin' on Ghost types! Just leave 'em to me, <var>!
