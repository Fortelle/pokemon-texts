Most impressive, <var>!
I wouldn't expect any less from a challenger endorsed by the strongest Champion ever to grace our beloved Galar region!
I really do wish I could have seen the Championship Match between you two. And I'm terribly sorry to have ruined the whole Gym Challenge and everything!
It's too bad, but it can't be helped... In order to solve the energy issue as soon as possible, we awakened Eternatus. But we couldn't control it. The Champion came to aid me, even at the cost of abandoning the match.
Indeed, just like a knight in shining armor coming to rescue a princess from a dragon!
I do tend to ramble on, I know. I love to make speeches. But I think I can stop talking now.
I think the Champion should have captured Eternatus by now. If you're curious, you can take the lift up.
And I trust you'll be going too, right, Hop? I certainly hope losing to me didn't discourage you too much. Go on now, both of you! Go see how our Champion is doing!
Discouraged...? You don't get it, do you, Chairman? Neither me nor my Pok√©mon are anywhere near giving up! We've learned how to be strong, thanks to the Gym Challenge you organized!
All right, <var>? I'm ready for anything. Are you?
Of course!
Give me a moment
Wouldn't expect any less from my rival! Now, come on! We've got to help Lee!
Yeah, we've no idea what's going on up there. Better be sure you're really ready!
Of course I won't stop you. Head up via the lift, if you wish!
