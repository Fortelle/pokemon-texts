My Gym's the first one people face, so we get a lot of challengers. That's why I try to keep the Gym mission challenging, but...
that didn't stop you from completing it, <var>! Proper job!
Sure seems like you understand Pokémon real well. This is gonna be a doozy of a battle! I'll have to Dynamax my Pokémon if I want to win!
That must have been a fulfilling Pokémon battle for you!
As proof that you have defeated a Gym Leader for the Gym Challenge, allow me to present you with your very own Grass Badge!
You can now catch Pokémon of up to Lv. 25!
You need to obtain all eight Gym Badges in order to complete the Gym Challenge. And the only way to gather the Badges is to defeat every Gym Leader!
Do you want to go back to the reception area?
Challenger <var>! My most sincere congratulations on defeating Gym Leader Milo! Please accept this TM to commemorate your victory.
Here, you can have Milo's uniform to go with it! It's a replica, of course.
The Grass Badge looks good on you! Keep at it, Challenger <var>!
