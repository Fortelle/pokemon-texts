<var> gives you a calm look.
Ready the <var> to catch <var>?
Grrrrrriiieeeld!!!
Lrrroooaaarrrd!!!
It seems like <var> is testing you.
Wow, brilliant!
Seems like you've been recognized by real royalty!

Ah.
What a sublime battle.
What a sublime battle.
We were so preoccupied with fussing over who the new king was... How terribly uncouth-like.

Hey, you. Spiky head.
Hey, you. Spiky head.
Ugh... Why should I go expectin' those two to start learnin' some manners now?
My older brother and I will atone for our crimes. Please escort us to the appropriate place.
My younger brother and I will atone for our crimes. Please escort us to the appropriate place.
If you really wanna atone, what's with that posh, superior attitude?
Ah, whatever...
<var>, I think I understand why you became the Champion.
But...please don't go callin' me anymore. Seems like I'm only gettin' called out when you're in some sticky situation.
Professor Sonia...
I can't ask you to forgive me. But I am truly sorry for deceiving you.
I was really hurt at first, but I've rallied. Thanks to you, I ended up learning quite a bit... Ah, that came off a bit more sarcastic than I thought it would!
Hehe... Well, please continue to do your best as a professor.
Righto! We've stopped them from causing any harm! Still, I hope <var> is OK...
*beep beep beep*
<var>, your Rotom Phone! Probably Hop, I reckon!
Hello? <var>?! I was just— Whoa! Hey, calm down!
Kyaaaun!
Kyaaaun!
Heh! I suppose you heard that? Yeah, I've got <var> here with me!
Are you OK?
Where are you?
<var> started going crazy, so things have been better! But I'm hanging in there...
<var> was going wild in the Slumbering Weald, but I'm doing my best to keep it in check!
I could sure use your help, though! Get over here quick as you can, would you?
I'll be waiting for you in the heart of the Slumbering Weald!
He sure sounds like he's got his hands full. Guess some things never change!
Grrrrrriiieeeld!!!
Lrrroooaaarrrd!!!
Even in its Poké Ball, <var> seems worried about its partner.
We should go to the Slumbering Weald and see how Hop and <var> are doing.
