Oh? Something is written on the door. "Let the first Pokémon hold a never-changing stone."
Something changed in the air...
A rocky power is emanating from the Pokémon statue... Do you want to check it out?
Zaza zari za...
Regirock stopped moving again.
The door is shut tight!
The huge Pokémon statue is looking down at you.
Better report back to Chief Peony!
*beep beep beep*
Oi oi! It's me, Peony! You lookin' out for yourself out there, Chief?
Come again? You've met the rock giant, Regirock?!
Gahaha! Smashin' job, Chief! Now, time to keep lookin' into the other giants! Keep up the good work!
Oi oi! It's me, Peony! How're things, Chief?
What's that? You've found someplace ruiny lookin'?!
That's gotta be one of those places! Y'know, where the legendary giants are s'posed to be!
D'you see a door with mysterious writin' on it? I hear no one's ever been able to get it open!
If all that's true, I think I'd call this particular adventure...
Ha! Well? How's that grab you?
Right then, Chief! I eagerly leave the rest of this research in your hands! Talk to you later!
