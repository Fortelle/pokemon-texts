Milo does more than just work the fields. He raises beautiful flowers, too!
Fluff fluff...
If you hold flowers, Pokémon will gather around you!
The League Cards of Gym Leaders tell all sorts of stories.
You can challenge the Gyms as many times as you want. I guess it's to test your unbreakable will!
If you've never seen it before, you should really go see the amazing scenery from the hilltop. In fact, you should go see it again even if you have seen it before.
That geoglyph... I heard nobody knows its name. Maybe it was a forbidden name or something...
I took a photo of the geoglyph, but it just doesn't compare to seeing it yourself. Still, looking at the photo is enough to bring back a rush of emotions!
How can a geoglyph drawn ages ago last for so long without eroding away? It's so perplexing! If I think too much about it, I won't be able to sleep.
You know what I think? I think the geoglyph was created with the help of Pokémon.
I wanna stick my head into the photo stand-in when I grow taller!
Such mysterious stone structures... Were they made by people...or by Pokémon?
If you don't take proper care of your equipment, it can fail you when you really need it.
Route 5 is really long... It feels good to speed through it, though!
More people are coming to see the geoglyph these days.
You could say Milo raised all the Trainers here!
The new Champion is pretty amazing!
Time for the Gym Challenge. How exciting!
I can't believe Milo lost...
Hey, is that the Champion...?
Wait, I have to wait my turn for the Gym Challenge?!
Bow wark!
