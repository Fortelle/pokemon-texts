Welcome, one and all!
Welcome to the wonderful world of Pokémon!
Our beloved Galar region is a wonderful place, with thriving nature...
beautiful cities, and many Pokémon with which we share our lives!
As you know, our society is able to thrive...
thanks to help from these mysterious creatures that we call Pokémon.
Yes, Pokémon are all around us—in the sea, in the sky, and even with us in our towns!
And those of us who choose to raise and train Pokémon to do battle and compete...
we call Pokémon Trainers!
Oh! But I'm getting carried away. Please allow me to introduce myself. My name is Rose, and it is a pleasure to be here.
Now turn your gaze to the Galar region's greatest Pokémon Trainer, your undefeated Champion...
It's time for Champion Leon's exhibition match!
Exhibition or not, Leon, your pristine record is about to end—when I beat you here today!

You know I don't lose battles, Raihan!
Charizard! Dynamax!
