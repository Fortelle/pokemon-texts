So this is Route 10! It's like a wall made out of snow!
Bet there'll be Ice-type Pokémon crawling out of the woodwork in a place like this!
Come on, <var>! Reckon we'll be able to train ourselves up to new heights here, before the Champion Cup starts?
I believe in myself and the Pokémon on my team, and I know we'll all get loads stronger!
So I'm off! See you in Wyndon, mate!
