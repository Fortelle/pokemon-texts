Go on—you pick first. I've already got my Wooloo, after all.
Where are you going, <var>?! You haven't chosen a Pokémon yet!
<var>! My dream is to help make the Trainers of the Galar region strong as they can be. Choose a partner for yourself and become one of those strong Trainers, won't you?
Scorbunny is Fire type. It's filled to bursting with fiery passion!
That's the Water-type Sobble. It adapts to anything, as surely as water flows.
The Grass-type Pokémon Grookey, eh? It's soothing—like a nice, long walk in the woods.






You're set on the Fire-type Pokémon Scorbunny?
Going with the Water-type Pokémon Sobble?
The Grass-type Pokémon Grookey, is it?
It's natural to want to consider your options! Though going with your instincts is fine, as well! You choose your dear partner however you like!
You chose <var>!
