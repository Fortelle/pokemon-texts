So, that means the culprit must be among us!
Wait... Who are you?!
After all the trouble of deducing things, don't go messing it up now!
*sigh* We're accused of being criminals... Will you help us out?
I just want to be let go soon...
Where did my Pokémon go off to...?
*cough* I suppose I should introduce myself.
The name's Howses. Yes, THAT Howses—the great detective. I've been hired by the hotel.
At present I have cornered the culprit of a most heinous crime.
And that crime is...
the strange case of who ate the large quantity of Berries in the lobby!
I've gathered the three people who were present in the lobby at the time of the crime...
But because of the noise, my marvelous deductive reasoning seems somewhat muddled at present...
That's it! You, interfering child! You will be my assistant!
Listen to the stories of each suspect, and find the culprit!
Looks like you were unlucky enough to get caught up in this, too...
It was a huge pile of Berries in the lobby, right? There's no way I could've eaten that many. I've been saying that this whole time.
That detective sure seems like trouble, doesn't he?
I will admit that I saw the mountain of Berries, but my doctor told me to stop eating those things. I've got it in writing right here.
*sigh* Where did my Pokémon go off to...?
Huh? Berries? I didn't eat them. Hey, you haven't seen my Pokémon around here, have you?
Chewww!
Ah! My Pokémon! Where were you?
Muuunch.
It sure has a lot of Berry juice on its mouth...
Heh heh heh...
After listening to everyone's accounts, I have deduced the culprit.
Dancer! You are the culprit!
What? Why me?
Because you're a dancer! You move and shake your body so much that you needed all that food for extra energy!
That's evidence as clear and sharp as the leek of a Farfetch'd!
What? What does that even mean? You're no detective—you're a fraud!
Wh-who are you calling a fraud?! You can't be referring to me, the great detective!
I can't deal with this disrespect! I leave it to you! You find the culprit!
*gasp*
Fraud detective... It's so cruel, I might cry...
You think I'm the criminal, too?!
You're a fraud, too! A fraud assistant to a fraud detective!
Good, you get it.
What? You think I'm the culprit?
Sorry, but you're totally wrong. I'll do you a favor and keep that a secret. Let's pretend that didn't just happen, OK?
I can't eat Berries, after all.
Wha?! You think I'm the culprit?
You're wrong! Think things over more carefully!
Oh!
Cromch?
Could this be the culprit?
Munch...
What? That Skwovet is the one responsible?
Muuunch?
Ah, it's true! It's got Berry bits around its mouth!
Oh, you're right. I see it now that I look more closely.
Yes, it definitely ate the Berries. Definitely...
Muuuncha.
As...
As... As expected of my assistant!
Here! Recompense for solving this mystery! Take it!
Splendid, just splendid! I'm overjoyed!
I must be off now. Take care, everyone!
Hey, you! Wait just a minute!
Hahaha! I guess I'm supposed to chase after him, too.
Muuunchaaa!
Thanks for solving the case! Skwovet is saying you did good, too.
Cheeew.
