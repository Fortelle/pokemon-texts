Here it is, the last match of the Finals! Who will earn the right to challenge the unbeatable Champion Leon?!
Will it be the brilliant rising star, Challenger <var>?
Or will it be the only Trainer that Champion Leon calls his rival... the tamer of dragons, Raihan?!
You're really something else, kid. You've made it all the way here! I guess that's why the Champion himself endorsed you, yeah?
Leon's my rival—and he chose you. So I've got to first prove I'm better than you if I'm to beat him! I've reworked my whole team, and now we're all geared up for one-on-one battles!
You might be thinking that you beat me once already... But if you think I'm the same Raihan you faced during the Gym Challenge, you'll soon regret it!
Challenger <var> seizes victory!
My lovely Pokémon and I have become much stronger than we were before... But you just blew right past us! Beyond anything I'd imagined!
I'm still pretty young myself, but it just goes to show that there's always someone younger coming up, reaching further than you ever dreamed... And you've got your whole future ahead of you!
Keep up the momentum! Prove that Leon's not unbeatable!
Number <var>, Challenger <var>, has achieved a dazzling triumph! The Trainer who was endorsed by the Champion will now face the very man who endorsed himer!
