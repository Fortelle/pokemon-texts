Not a brilliant turn of events, but the ruins were brought into the light for us to see...
What does this tell us about Galar's legends?
Pokémon?
A sword and shield?
Right! More than any hero, there's those things that appear to be Pokémon that stand out! Not just that, but those Pokémon appear to be holding a sword and shield as if they were using them!
Anything else look interesting to you?
The hero...was actually two people?
The same as the tapestries?
Oh, good observation! There really were two heroes. But if that's the case, then why only the one statue at the Budew Drop Inn?
More than any statue of a hero or old tapestry, these ruins made in truly ancient times must show us the real truth.
Which means...
The sword is a Pokémon!
The shield is a Pokémon!
Yup! I was thinking the same thing! Seems like at some point in history the sword and shield were combined with the two actual Pokémon and treated as the same thing... But then what? They just faded from history?
Two young heroes... The sword and shield were actually Pokémon... But why would the truth of these ruins be hidden when their stories were depicted in artwork?
With your help, I really feel like we made a big discovery here. Thanks! I'll give you a couple of these, so you keep giving it your best in the Gym Challenge, too, OK? Guess you'll be headed to Ballonlea next, right?
So... There was history being covered up by all that over-stylized artwork... I'm gonna have to look into this some more.
