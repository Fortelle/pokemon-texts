It seems like my children are giving something to people who've had a Let's Go experience... But what in the world is a Let's Go experience? Do you have any idea?







Hey, have you and Eevee had a...?

Nah, it was just my imagination. Sorry to bother you!
I knew it! You've had a Let's Go experience with Eevee, haven't you?
I hope you'll have another Let's Go experience with this Eevee, too!
The Eevee I gave you is special, you know? You should definitely Dynamax it!
Hey, have you and Pikachu had a...?

Oh, no, I think I was mistaken. Don't mind me!
I knew it! You had a Let's Go experience with Pikachu, didn't you?
I hope you'll have another Let's Go experience with this Pikachu, too!
The Pikachu I gave you is very special! You should try Dynamaxing it!
