We've been expecting you, Challenger <var>. As the Champion Cup is about to begin, allow me to explain how it works... First, there are the Semifinals, where you will face the other Trainers who completed the Gym Challenge. If you manage to win in the Semifinals, you will then face the top seven Gym Leaders of the Galar region in the Finals. Defeat them, and you will finally be able to face the Champion in the Championship Match.
The matches will begin shortly. Please ready yourself and head to the pitch.


Your first opponent is already waiting for you on the pitch.
You again, eh? Well, best of luck to you, kid. Not that it'll do you a lick of good. Marnie's sure to win this thing.
As members of Team Yell, we'll be cheerin' for our Marnie.
