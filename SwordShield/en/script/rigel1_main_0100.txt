Some wild Max Mushrooms! Do you want to pick them?
Hold up a sec!
Wait just one moment!
*wheeze*... *wheeze*...
*pant*... *pant*...
Hellooo, what's this?! Three Max Mushrooms in one spot? Here I thought I'd need to go find them one by one!
Hah! Just as I expected! Multiple Max Mushrooms growing in a bunch!
I saw those mushrooms first! I swear!
My psychic powers picked up on these Max Mushrooms eons before you found them.
I've been at the dojo longer and all. Sooo... it's only fair that you let me have 'em. Riiight?
I believe I should be the one to get those Max Mushrooms. First come, first served, and all!
No way!
Sure, you can have them!
Tsk! Yeah, I figured that's what you'd say...
Hmph! I knew you wouldn't listen to reason.
Waaait... What's this now? Are you givin' me attitude? Pityin' me, are you?!
What's this? Are you trying to show you're stronger than me? How distasteful!
Gosh, you're a pain in the neck... You just show up outta nowhere, and just happen to be young and talented...
I find your presence most disturbing! You show up at the dojo unannounced and go on to show such talent, even though you're still so young...
If you're looking to get in my way, well, I think some vile poisons will take care of that!
You dare get in my way? I warned you about my psychic powers, and now you'll experience them firsthand!
Aaagh! Why can't I win?! I'm trying as hard as I can! What am I missing?!
Blast it. Victory still eludes me... What is it that I lack? What do I need?
Fine, you can have those silly mushrooms! I'm going to find better ones, anyway!
Very well, you can have those ones. I'll go and find myself some Max Mushrooms that are far more elegant!
So there! Nyah!
Avery, Teleport!
