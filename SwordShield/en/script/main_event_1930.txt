You came to help me in spite of the danger? Thanks, Hop. And you, <var>. You two really have grown tremendously!
But no need for you kids to worry. It seems like some power of Eternatus's was keeping my team from Dynamaxing, but... we've had a champion time all the same!
Charizard and the rest of my champion team members have really worn Eternatus down.
Now if I can simply catch it in a Pok√© Ball, we should be able to get this madness under control. Then everything will be back to normal. So watch this! It's going to be a real champion catch!
