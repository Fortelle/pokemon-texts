All right? The big moment's finally here, eh?
I came just to cheer you on, you know!

After all, it's the showdown between my big brother and my rival... Who should I really want to win more?

Right... You reckon I should cheer for <var>, too, don't you? Couldn't agree more. After all, we did start this thing out together, way back in Postwick.
So you better beat Lee, you hear? If anyone can beat the unbeatable Champion, it'll be you, mate.
