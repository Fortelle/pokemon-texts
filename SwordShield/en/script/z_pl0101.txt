I'm Ball Guy! I'm here to cheer everyone on, whether they want me to or not!
It's the Ball Guy! Who are you on the inside?
Aaah! A Pok√© Ball monster!
I feel like Challenger <var> has a balanced team, but she doesn't have any way to decisively win, you know?
Challenger <var>! I'll remember your name from now on! I've always loved how decisive your party is!
I guess the Champion's going to extend his winning streak again.
The unbeatable Champion was defeated, and a new Champion was born. We got to witness history being made!
Challenger <var>! Remember, the Semifinals and Finals are just speed bumps on your way to facing Leon. You have to win!
You made it to the Champion Cup! That's amazing! You really are a powerful challenger now, <var>. Everyone in Galar wants to see what you can do!
You made it all the way to the Championship Match! You can't lose now! You have to win, <var>. You have to beat the unbeatable Leon and bring a new era to Galar!
It's the great Champion <var>! I was the first one to see you had the potential to become Champion! Maybe I can become a Trainer trainer some day since I'm so good at discovering talent! Hee hee... I'm just joking. Seriously though, congratulations! I'm so happy for you!
Ba ba bug!
E-excuse me, but... could I get a handshake?
Of course!
It'd be my pleasure
Th-thank you so much! I'm never going to forget this!
I'm a huge fan, Challenger <var>! I want to become as strong as you someday!
So she made it this far, huh.
I wonder who'll win?
I can't tell who's going to finally win!
Oh, it's <var>! So cool...
It's Challenger <var>!
Give it your best shot! No regrets!
The whole world is watching this match!
It's the new Champion! Your battle had me in tears!
Oh my goodness! It's <var>!
Let's go, <var>! Let's go!
You can do it!
You've got to beat Leon! You just have to!
<var>!
We're counting on you to keep the Galar region nice and lively, Champion!
Until the emergency in Hammerlocke settles down, there's nothing we can do...
