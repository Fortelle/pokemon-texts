Hey there, Chief! Thanks for stoppin' by!
I'm finally gettin' a little quality family time with my darlin' Nia.
Hmm? I dropped something at base camp?
Is that really mine? I don't recall ever writin' it...
Hmm? Hang on—isn't that the Max Lair there in that clue?
Waaagh!
Huh?
What happened?!
Creatures! A horde of creatures appeared inside the Max Lair! And we don't know if they're Pokémon!
What?!
Has something caused alien beings to appear? And is this somehow connected to that Ultra Wormhole that opened up briefly in the sky?
Well, sounds like some new, crazy thing's afoot!
And you know what that means, Chief! Bet you a new expedition's approachin'!
And I know just what to call this one!
Ha! How d'you like that one, Chief?
Anyway, for now, there's your goal: catch the Pokémon—or whatever— in the photo on that odd clue! Now get pumped for some more adventurin'!
