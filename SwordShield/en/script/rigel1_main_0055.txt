Yaaahooo! Are you ready for a battle?
Oh my, you like to take your time, don't you? Don't keep this old man waiting too long!
All right! Let's get this show started! This is the best way to get to know new students!
Bah ha ha! I lost! You're pretty strong, aren't you?
Hey, the newbie won! Master wasn't going all out, but that's still pretty impressive!
Who is that kid, anyway?
The way you battle really shows me how much you care about your Pokémon!
Even if you've come because of a misunderstanding, as long as you have a will to learn...
then you're welcome at the Master Dojo!
I think we can all help each other become stronger! I'm happy you've come to join us!
So on that note, here's your Dojo Uniform!
With that on, you'll fit right in with the students of my Master Dojo.
You got a Dojo Uniform!
Hey, newbie!
If you want to change or just take a break, use that room over there!
Now then!
With <var> here now, the dojo's at max capacity!
It's time to really start our training! You'll all be facing three trials.
Three trials?!
Wait. Why is there a max capacity for this dojo?
And there's more! The person who completes the three trials will receive the secret armor of this dojo!
Ooh! A secret set of armor! I want it!
Heh heh, that's the spirit! Now, lemme explain the first trial...
Aww! But, Masterrr! You haven't given me my uniform yet!
Pardon me, Master! I haven't received my uniform yet!
Why does that kid get a uniform but not me?! It's not fair!
I daresay it's unfair for only that child to get a uniform. Unequal, even! I demand an item swap!
Oh dear. Do you really not have a uniform? My bad, my bad!
That's easy to fix, though! I have another uniform right here for you, Klara!
That's easy to fix, though! I have another uniform right here for you, Avery!
Hee hee! The squeaky wheel gets the grease!
Ha! It does pay to complain sometimes!
Klara got a Dojo Unif—
Avery got a Dojo Unif—
POKE!
Huh?! What was that?
Eek! What in the world?
Wha—?! It's gone! Where'd my Dojo Uniform go?
Hey! My Dojo Uniform! It's gone missing!
Po-po-po...
Huh?
Hmm?
Poke!
That speed... Was it really these Slowpoke?
I've never seen any Slowpoke move so fast!
Hey! Give it back! Give me my Dojo Uniform!
How dare you? Are you using Trick?! Return my Dojo Uniform immediately!
Slooow? Slooow...
... ... ...
Poooke!
Hey! Get back here!
Oh my! Where do you think you're going?!
Oops! Guess I let them out of their Poké Balls a little too soon! Heh heh heh!
Master... What's up with those Slowpoke?
This is the first trial, my students...
You've all gotta chase after those fast Slowpoke, trained with care by little old me! But that's not all... You need to defeat them, too!
And while you're at it, could you get Klara's Dojo Uniform back?
And while you're at it, could you get Avery's Dojo Uniform back?
Awww! Do we have to?!
Well, that's that! Do your best, you lot!
Do you want to change back into your usual clothes?
All set! Time to chase down those fast Slowpoke!
No need to change! Time to chase down those fast Slowpoke!
The first trial is to chase down the three fast Slowpoke! And while you're at it, it would be cool if you could get back the Dojo Uniform they stole!
Slowpoke are usually super zoned out, but that didn't stop the master from raising them to be super fast!
The way they moved... Those aren't ordinary Slowpoke! Maybe they wanted to wear the Dojo Uniform?
I know you might be feeling nervous, being new here and all. But don't you worry. All our students are good, through and through. They'll take care of you.
