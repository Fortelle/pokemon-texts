Welcome to the Rose of the Rondelands. We pride ourselves on offering five-star service that is beloved throughout the world.
I'm a professional concierge! I'm more than happy to assist Pokémon...even if we don't speak the same language!
It's important to always be smiling! My legs are feeling a bit swollen, though...
I came to Galar on my Braviary instead of my private jet, but I must admit it was a little tiring...
I know my wife is complaining, but she actually loves traveling with her Pokémon.
I was invited by Macro Cosmos to come watch the matches.
A celebrity watching any match is sure to get everyone interested.
Being a doorman is a lot of work! It doesn't matter how many people come and go, mistakes are unacceptable. That's why we have Pokémon helping us out, too.
Weeeeeelcoooooome.
