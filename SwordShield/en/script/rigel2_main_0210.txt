Huh? Well, how 'bout that, Chief!
Looks like that was the last bit of the grand Peony Adven-tour that I had for you!
Whoooooo! Now this is an occasion! What's the word? Ultra-mega-epic!
Your passion for all this caught me off guard, Chief...
This whole Adven-tour thing was built out of a load of rubbish I scraped together. Even I had my doubts about the whole thing. But you? You went at it with a ton of energy!
You don't s'pose those Pokémon you caught were really the ones in the legends, do you?
I do!
Well, actually...
Nah, actually, never mind. You don't have to tell me anything!
A look at your face tells me everything I need to know, Chief.
I can tell that you must've done some ultra-mega-epic explorin'!
And whatever you discovered on your way... that's a special treasure just for you!
I'm not about to rain on your parade by bein' nosy and askin' silly questions!
Well, Chief <var>... Thanks for stickin' around and finishin' every part of my Adven-tour!
I want you to have this. Consider it my way of sayin' "thank you"!
Hmmm... But I can't shake the feelin' I'm forgettin' somethin'...
Ugh. Daaad! People can hear you all the way outside, you know!
My darlin' Nia!
Huh! This place isn't bad! So this is where you're staying?
Oh hey, <var>! Fancy meetin' you outside the Max Lair for once!
Yeah, it's been a while!
What took you?
Hehe! You're really on my wavelength.
Heh, yeah, sorry for all that!
So you actually kept my old man company! Cheers, I owe you one!
I've had my fill of Dynamax Adventures now...
So I thought I may as well try one of those what-d'you-call-'em tours my old man was going on about.
Oh...
Huh? What? Why'd everyone suddenly go quiet?
H-hold on! Gimme just a mo! I'll come up with some new legends straightaway!
You'll have your adventure, Nia! A nice father-daughter expedition! Finally!
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Wait one second! You'll "come up with" legends?
Also, that's way too close! I need some personal space here!
R-right! First things first! I've got something for you, Nia...
Here! I made this brilliantly shiny explorer's outfit for you! You can get changed while I come up with somethin'.
What in the world?! Are you trying to turn me into a disco ball or something?
Why have I got to wear this golden one when yours is normal?
Gahahaha! Isn't it obvious? You're my darlin' daughter!
I want you to shine so bright that everyone notices you!
Ugh! It's things like this!
I've changed my mind! Here—you can have this!
Hey! But why?!
You got a Gold Expedition Uniform!
I'm heading back to my own adventure! Time to catch some more Dynamax Pokémon!
No! Come back, Nia!
No need to be so rebellious! I know you really love me! Don't you?!
Agh! Sorry for the sudden commotion, Chief! It was a blast explorin' with you!
You're free to keep usin' our base camp, of course!
Anyway, time for me to go spend some quality time with my darlin' daughter!
Hold on, Nia! Wait for me!
