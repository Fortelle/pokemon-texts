What's this? What's this? Let's see how you and Kubfu are getting along...
Aw, you've hardly gotten to know each other at all! Go on, then. Spend more time together! Go have some fun!
Getting there, but there's still lots of room for improvement. Your bond will become stronger as you have battles and gain experience together!
Oooh! I can tell you're warming up to each other! I hear a Soothe Bell is great for becoming friends with Pokémon, too!
You're just starting to become friends! How wonderful! Don't forget—playing together while camping is a great way to build camaraderie!

I put some little markers on your Town Map for where the view of the Isle of Armor's just gorgeous. You and Kubfu should go and enjoy the scenery!
Once you two are the best of friends, we'll start with Kubfu's proper training!
Bearmor!
Good, good! You two are just the best of friends now, aren't you?
Kubfu's really become more confident. How wonderful!
I daresay I think you're both ready.
Follow me, you two.
Hmm? Why, <var>, I don't see Kubfu in your team or in your Boxes.
There's no point in this training without Kubfu. Are you sure you want to continue?
Are you sure you won't regret continuing with the training, even without Kubfu?
Well then, follow me.
That's what I thought! We'll continue with the training once you bring Kubfu back!
Hmm? Oh, Kubfu's at the Pokémon Nursery? I guess I'll have to wait until it's back with you to see how friendly you've become!
Hmm? Oh, Kubfu's off working on a Poké Job? I guess I'll have to wait until it's back with you to see how friendly you've become!
