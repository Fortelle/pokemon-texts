What...what is all this?! We need to help Lee!
And what do you plan on doing, Gym Challenger?
Stopping the Darkest Day!
Helping the Champion
Uh, pardon? What are you talking about? There's nothing to stop now. We've already brought about the Darkest Day...or should I say, the ultimate Pokémon—Eternatus!
I'm afraid I can't allow that. The Champion is the one who needs to control Eternatus.
Must I explain myself? From your perspective, I suppose it must seem that I am doing something terrible. I don't expect you to understand. But I must provide the Galar region with limitless energy to ensure everlasting prosperity. It is my purpose, my duty, my destiny!
That's why we've been giving the Wishing Stars to Eternatus! Surely you remember the red light that caused a ruckus around Hammerlocke. That was all part of our experiments to awaken Eternatus! You must understand. I can't let you interfere with my plan to protect the future of Galar!
