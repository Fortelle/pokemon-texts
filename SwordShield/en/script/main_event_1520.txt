Heh. I knew you'd get all the Badges and meet me here.
I know that there's been a lot between us, what with my big brother, Team Yell, helpin' Spikemuth and all that...
But the truth is, when all's said and done... I really just wanna become Champion for myself!
So don't take it personal when I kick your butt!
Everyone in the stadium was watchin' us durin' all that... I heard them cheerin' for me and my Pok√©mon. It was nice...
I may have lost, but... At least we drove the audience wild! Guess that's not so bad!
Think I'll join my brother in the stands, and we'll watch from the sidelines to see who ends up challengin' the Champion.
Just so y'know... I still haven't decided if I'm gonna cheer for you... See ya!
