The dojo has different training equipment for building up the muscles of Pokémon!
There are a lot of shiny gold trophies. Each one is polished and spotless!
It's a game in which a lot of square Pokémon appear!
There are strategy guides for a whole bunch of different games!

Whack whack!

Ryaryarya!
Through these doors is the Battle Court— sacred ground for battle and for valor. Entering for any reason other than battle is strictly forbidden.
Klara is waiting for you on the Battle Court. Don't hold back!
Avery is waiting for you on the Battle Court. Don't hold back!
Master Mustard is waiting for you on the Battle Court. ...I wish you the best of luck.
Oh dear, I can't see the telly if you're standing there!
Come on, <var>... It's not nice to bother people like that!
Oh, you know what? I ran into that one Gym Leader at the station when I came here to the Isle of Armor. You remember the one! I guess all sorts of folks are starting to come here to the island to train a bit.
<var>! Bet you'll never guess what rare Pokémon I found when I was out doing my survey!
Well, let's see it then!
I'll take a look later
That training must be keeping you real busy, huh? Not that I'm going to let you outshine me!
Heh heh, surprised? Don't worry, mate. I'll keep on letting you know whenever I find a cool Pokémon you've never managed to see.
I wonder what new Pokémon I might see today... Every day's the chance for a new discovery!
Medals from many different competitions are arranged nicely!
Toy balls for Pokémon to play with!
Composure
Pika!
