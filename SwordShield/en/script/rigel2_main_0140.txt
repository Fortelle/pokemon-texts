It's one of the fields Calyrex told you about!
Do you want to plant the Carrot Seeds in this field?
I see you have reached one of the fields.
Are you truly ready to plant the Carrot Seeds?
If you plant the seeds in this field, Iceroot Carrots will grow. It has been so long that my memory is hazy, but I believe that my loyal steed would often partake of this sort of vegetable. If Iceroot Carrots were what my steed preferred, it must have been Ice type, mustn't it? It's most vexing that I can't recall. I suppose we will see.
If you plant the seeds in this field, Shaderoot Carrots will grow. It has been so long that my memory is hazy, but I believe that my loyal steed would often partake of this sort of vegetable. If Shaderoot Carrots were what my steed preferred, it must have been Ghost type, mustn't it? It's most vexing that I can't recall. I suppose we will see.
I will ask but once more... Are you sure this is the field in which you want to plant the seeds?
So you wish to reconsider? Very well... I shall return once you have made your choice.
Very well. Then I ask that you plant the seeds.
*dig dig dig*
You planted the Carrot Seeds in the field!
*pat pat*
Kah hah hah! Very good, very good. You have an able hand for working with soil!
Now then, it's time I did my part. Let me show you my powers!
Crownow!
Rownwo!
Crowrown!
*rumble rumble rumble*
*doink*
*gasp gasp*
You planted so many seeds, and yet my powers could only get one to grow...
To think that I have fallen so low! It truly breaks my heart...
But soon it will be time to bid my sorrow farewell!
Now, human child. I must ask that you pull that Iceroot Carrot free with all your might!
Now, human child. I must ask that you pull that Shaderoot Carrot free with all your might!
Chief Peony is floating in the air and glowing!
