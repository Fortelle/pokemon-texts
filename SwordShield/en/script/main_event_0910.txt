What a cute Silicobra.
Just look at those adorable eyes.
It's our duty as Team Yell to make sure Silicobra gets a nice, peaceful sleep!
Hello there. If I promise not to wake the Pokémon, will you let me through?
Of course! It'd be our pleasure.
Oh, hey, <var>. You're heading to Stow-on-Side, right?
Oi, Team Yell. Don't suppose you'll let us through?
Nah, you kids are way too loud. Can't be lettin' you through. An' we're particularly not fond of kids wearin' the Challenge Band!
With all your stompin' around, Silicobra is sure to wake up!
Right...
What do you say, <var>? If we don't get past them, we won't be able to continue our Gym Challenge at Stow-on-Side...
I'll battle them!
Let me think...
You... Yeah, that's the spirit!
I don't figure thinking at them is going to change much about the situation. What else you got?
You two are way too noisy. You don't wanna wake up Silicobra, now do you?
I swear, kids these days... Well, we've got no choice. We have to send you packin'. It's all for the sake of Silicobra!
Think I'll leave this to you, <var>. Keep up the pace.
Silicobra might wake up after all that ruckus!
Then there's no point in us stickin' around! Let's get out of here! We'll make these bothersome kids holler some other day!
<var>... You and <var> were brilliant together!
See, Bede really wiped the floor with me the last time we battled... And don't get me wrong—I can take a loss! Battling means you've got to lose sometimes.
But he said that I was dragging Lee's good name through the mud, being so rubbish like I was... And I just can't get those words out of my head!
If I'm weak, then people'll think Lee's weak, too... But I don't want that! I can't let Lee get dragged down! He's the unbeatable Champion! I'm gonna have to take some time figuring this out. See you around, <var>...
Hsss...
