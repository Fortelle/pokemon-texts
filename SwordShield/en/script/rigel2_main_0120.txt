Have you seen what's happened to the statue of the King of Bountiful Harvests? Its head has become massive!
Hmm? You say that's the way the king's supposed to look?
Now that you mention it, it does resemble the design on our town's souvenir shirts... But you speak as if you've seen the king with your own two eyes!
That statue's been broken since I was a child...








Oh, of course! You wanted to learn about the loyal steed of the King of Bountiful Harvests!
Well, I don't know why you'd be interested in such things, but... Come, then. Follow me.
An old book I read long ago said that the king's loyal steed was particularly fond of a certain special vegetable...
But my memory isn't what it used to be. I can't recall what exactly the steed so desired!
I think it best that you search on the bookshelf over there if you want to find out any more.
If you want to learn about the loyal steed of the king, read the books on the bookshelf.
