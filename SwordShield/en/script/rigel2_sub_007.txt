Oh? Something is written on the door. "Let ring the piercing note that will wake the giant of steel."
Something changed in the air...
A steely power is emanating from the Pokémon statue... Do you want to check it out?
Ji-ji-ze-ji-zoh.
Registeel stopped moving again.
The door is shut tight!
The huge Pokémon statue is looking down at you.
Better report back to Chief Peony!
*beep beep beep*
Oi oi! Peony here! Haven't hurt yourself or anything, have you?
Come again? You've gone and met the steel giant, Registeel?!
Gahaha! Smashin' work, Chief! Now take that energy and go catch the others! Keep up the good work!
