Just having a Pokémon with you doesn't make you a real Trainer, you know. Proper Trainers raise their Pokémon up to be first-rate in battle, too!
Oh, and you think you're worthy of calling yourself such a proper Trainer already, Hop? Guess I'll be the judge of that! Let's see how you handle yourself in a battle against your friend, if she's up for it.
What do you say? Willing and ready to take Hop on in the first-ever Pokémon battle of your life?
Then how about I give you a spot of advice. You don't want to go getting so caught up in things that you forget everything you've accomplished till now. Take a moment to jot down what you've done, in order to save a record of your progress!
Believe in your partner Pokémon! And care for them, too, with all your heart. Do those two things, and I'm certain you'll learn to choose the moves that suit your Pokémon. And more importantly...to have a champion time battling with them!
Looks like everyone's on board, Pokémon and Trainers alike? Then let's do this!
I've watched every match that Lee's ever had! I've read every book and magazine he left behind at home, too! I know exactly what to do in order to win!
Well, that was a shock! Guess I know now why Lee thought he should give you a Pokémon, too...
Sorry, mate. Even if you did get your Pokémon direct from a champ like Lee, looks like I'm still the greatest!
You and your Pokémon all fought hard. Made me almost want to let out Charizard and join in on all the fun! Good effort out there, <var>! Why don't I get you all sorted?
And, <var>, you've got real promise! In fact, I've got a favor to ask you... Be a real rival to Hop, would you? Push him, and make the both of you stronger!
Me and <var> are ready to have a go at you anytime!
