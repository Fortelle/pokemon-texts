Welcome, Gym Challenger! Allow me to help you through your registration.
First things first—how about a quick refresher about the Gym Challenge? Your goal as a Gym Challenger is to complete each Gym mission, defeat every Gym Leader, and gather eight Gym Badges!
Got it!
Gym missions?
So, would you like to attempt the Gym mission?
Let's do it!
One moment...
The Gym mission is a sort of test you need to go through before facing the Gym Leader. Each Gym has a different mission for challengers.
If you would like to attempt the Gym mission, please change into your uniform!
Then let the Gym mission begin! Give it your best shot!
You're here for the Gym mission, right? One of my favorite words is perseverance!
Congratulations! You've completed the Gym mission! Don't get too confident, though. Your teamwork with your Pokémon is key when battling the Gym Leader!
Oh, of course! Please come back anytime once you're ready to attempt the mission!
