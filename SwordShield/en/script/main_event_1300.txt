There's no way we're lettin' you anywhere near Spikemuth! And that means we can't let you go on to Route 9!
It's Team Yell's duty to cheer on these lovely Drednaw! And we also get to stop people from headin' out over the water!
Ba bite!
Yes, I understand... All I'm saying is that I can make it so that Rotom Bikes can ride on water...
Why, we meet again, my young Gym Challenger friend! Remember me? I gave you that bike! So, do you think you could do me another favor and teach these ruffians a lesson or two?
It's our duty to protect Drednaw! And that means yer gonna need to give up on the Gym Challenge! You look like you need convincin', so how about a Pokémon battle?!
Then clear off, would ya? We're busy cheerin' on Drednaw!
I'll send you packin'! For the sake of Drednaw, of course.
Even if you reach Spikemuth, it's not like you're gonna be able to do the Gym Challenge. Why not just give up now?
Gah! HShe's gonna ride the Drednaw!
Oi! I've got an idea! We can get on Drednaw first and ride it away!
All right! Get a move on, Drednaw! See ya later, Gym Challenger!
Ba bite!
Seems you've come to my aid yet again. How's the cycling life been treating you? Are you having fun?
Wouldn't it be great if you could ride your Rotom Bike on the water, too?
That's why I'm going to add these special parts, allowing it to travel along the water's surface...just for you!
All right, all right! With the Rotom Bike "Water Mode," you'll cruise across the water like a Pokémon with Swift Swim! By the by, when you're riding on land, we'll call it "Land Mode."
