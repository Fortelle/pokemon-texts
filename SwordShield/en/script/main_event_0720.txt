'Scuse me, mate, sorry to bother you... You're one of them takin' part in the Gym Challenge, right?
Crikey, but that's really somethin'! I'd love a battle against a great Trainer like you.
Well, look at you, <var>!
Surrounded by adoring fans, eh? You'll even be showing up Lee pretty soon!
Oi, jog on, mate! Can't you see we're in the middle of a conversation here?
Yeah? And can't you see that I'm Hop, the Trainer who'll be your next Champion?
Oooh, so we've got a joker here, eh? You're so funny, I forgot to laugh.
You think I'm joking? I'll prove it, then! And I think a battle with you lot would definitely end with some laughs!
Let's take 'em on together, <var>! You ready, mate?
The two of us were endorsed by the Champion himself! We'll show you just what that means!
Got it! Then get yourself all ready for a good battle!
Well, if you insist... Team Yell's gonna teach you kids that the Gym Challenge's no joke! You better not be yell-ow!
What'd this other kid have to come waltzin' up for, eh? I just wanted to knock off challengers one at a time...
Nice one, <var>! That's my rival for you!
Now then... Where could Kabu have gone off to? Let's keep going. Maybe he's farther in!
That little mug's the Champion's little brother... Guess that's what you get when your older brother's not useless...
I know we're Team Yell, but we'll leave quietly once we're beaten...
