Hey, <var>!
I was born 'ere so I know another way in.
If you wanna get into the town, how 'bout I show you the way? But...you're my rival. So you'll have to beat me in a battle first, got it?
With pleasure!
Let me think about it
Oh, did I misjudge you...? Ahhh, I get it. You need to get ready! Go on, then! I'll wait here until you're ready.
You've had a pretty good win streak in the Gym Challenge, just like me! I respect you as my rival and all that, but I got too much at stake to go around losin' now!
My partner Morpeko has been interested in you and your strength, and I think I get it now. But I've got everyone in Spikemuth supportin' me!
I'm definitely gonna get all eight Gym Badges just so I can have a rematch with you. Don'cha forget it! I'll get my revenge in the Champion Cup!
Anyway, I promised I'd show you a way in, so follow me!
