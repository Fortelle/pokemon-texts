A Gym Challenger! Ah, but if you want to battle our Leader Kabu, you'll need to have earned a Grass Badge in Turffield and a Water Badge in Hulbury first!
A Gym Challenger! And you've even earned your first two Badges! But I'm afraid our Leader Kabu has gone off to Galar Mine No. 2 to undergo some special training with his team. You might want to head to Hulbury and try to catch him in the mines on the way back here.
Hey, a Gym Challenger! That's a welcome sight! We don't have too many challengers, since our Leader Kabu has made his Gym mission so hard... But I'll be happy to get you registered at once!
I'm ready!
Not yet
Roger that! I'll be here, so come back when you're ready to challenge our Gym!
If you're here to challenge our Gym, we'll ask you to change into your uniform first...
Congratulations on clearing the Gym mission! You had that one in the bag, eh? Next up will be your match against Leader Kabu. I wonder which one of you will burn brighter?
You may find the Fire Gym's mission a bit different than others you've faced. In you go!
Please take this TM to commemorate what you accomplished here today!
And take one of our uniforms. It's the same design as Kabu himself wears.
Few enough people challenge Leader Kabu, and even fewer manage to defeat him... It'll be a treat to see how such a promising Trainer does in the Gym Challenge!
Back for our Gym mission, are you? Good luck racking up those points!

Heya, <var>! I was on fire in my battle against that Kabu!
