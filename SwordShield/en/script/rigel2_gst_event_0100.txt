<var>! Hop! I knew you two'd make it through!
From the moment I saw the tourney bracket, I knew this was how things would end up, Lee!
Haha! Well then, here we are...facing off in the final round!
This match'll settle who's the strongest team... So let's give it all the effort it deserves!
I've gotta say, I'd still rather win this thing by beating you, Leon...
But if it means schooling these two, then maybe teaming up with you isn't too bad, either!
Come on, <var>! We're gonna win, even if we have to pry victory right from the hands of Lee's team!
<var> and Marnie, eh? You're gonna be one pain of a pair to battle.
I've been waitin' for a chance to show you how strong Spikemuth's new Gym Leader is, Bro! Finally, I get to let you see firsthand!
Oh, I'm well aware how strong you've got. But I'm still your big brother. You get how it is.
Now bring it, Sis! Get ready to get crushed down to dust!
I was really hoping for a chance to finally beat Leon...
But I don't mind missing that chance if it means I get to beat these two!
No holdin' back, <var>! You an' me are gonna come out on top!
