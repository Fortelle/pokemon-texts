This is the reception desk!
Turns out I was the first to register for the Champion Cup. In other words, I'm already number one. It's pretty much in the bag that I'll win this thing!
<var>, correct? We've been watching over your performance in the Gym Challenge. This is just a formality, of course, but I'll need to check your Gym Badges, if you don't mind.




I'm all sorted and ready to battle you on the biggest stage of them all!

But it looks like Bede couldn't make it. Hard luck... Somehow I didn't think he'd just take being disqualified lying down, you know what I mean?
I guess it is what it is... Come on, <var>. We should head to the locker room!
This is it. I really made it. I made it through the Gym Challenge. There might be four remainin' in the Semifinals... But I'm the one who's gonna win through and battle the Champion.
Urara!
