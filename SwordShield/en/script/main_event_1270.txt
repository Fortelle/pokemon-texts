Got that Gym Badge, <var>? Nice one!
Oh, hey! There you are.
I've been trying to find out more about the Darkest Day and the sword and shield Pokémon, but still no luck...
Wait! Hold on!
No way! What's this?!
A new chapter in the old Galar legends?
A fifth tapestry!
An absolutely fantastic poster!
Exactly! Bob, with his brilliant smile, must be part of the legend!
Wait, what are you on about?! Don't confuse me!
The heroes look sad... And where are the sword and shield? What was the meaning of this picture?
An end to the legend?
Some kind of seal?
Hmm... Perhaps when their duty was completed, they went into some kind of sleep?
You think so? I guess it could be that they were sealed away. Or maybe they've gone into some kind of sleep?
Based on those statues we saw back in Stow-on-Side, the sword and the shield were actually two Pokémon, right?
That's right! That's my take on it, at least.
You remember the Pokémon we met that day? Do you think...it could've been one of them? Either the sword or the shield Pokémon?
You...met them?
Come on! You know what I'm talking about, right, <var>?
In the Slumbering Weald?
I really don't
Exactly! The mad Pokémon we ran into in the fog! Don't you think that could've been it?
Not so sharp when it's not about battle, huh? Don't you remember that mad Pokémon we ran into in the fog that day? Don't you think that could've been it?
Oh, that's right! You lot have been in the Slumbering Weald.
I only started on this journey because my gran told me to, but this is turning out to be too much fun! You've got to tell me more. How about we discuss this over a meal? Go on, what do you want to eat? Let's get our orders in!
Fascinating... All right, the next thing to do now that we're done eating is to have a look around Circhester! Let's inspect the Hero's Bath!
