There, there... Everything's all right...
Grrr...
Grrr...
You don't have to lose control. You can manage this. I know you can! You're the true hero who protected the Galar region, after all!
Rrr...
Rrr...
...Bark!
...Bark!
Oh? Got everything under control? See! I knew you could do it, champ!
Hop! You look a fright!
You two made it! And yeah, well, I was just focused on trying to calm down <var>, so...
*sigh* Rushing in and trying to calm a legendary hero head on was awful reckless...
Bark!
Bark!
It looks happy now
Hop, you're amazing
Yeah... It does, doesn't it? Though I can tell you, things were looking pretty dire here at first!
Y-you think? I'm pretty chuffed to hear that from you of all people, <var>!
Kuuun.
Kuuun.
What? Wait, really?! Y-you sure about this?
What did <var> say?
That it thinks I'm worthy of it... That it'll become my Pok√©mon... I'm pretty sure that was it, anyway!
Wait, seriously?! That's totally crazy!
Is it...is it really OK?
All right, here I go, then...
Hyah!
Hop caught <var>!
You two really are something!
I still don't quite see anything like that in myself yet...
But thanks to your help, I'm starting to!
<var>! I've got a favor to ask!
Though I hate to look like I'm copying that posh jerk, Bede... Still! I want another battle against you!
Everything started right here...
in the Slumbering Weald!
Hop sure must be tough if he's been accepted by <var>. Make sure you're in top form before challenging him.
If you need some time to prepare, I can take you back to the entrance of the woods.
Want me to show you to the center of the woods, where Hop is waiting?
All right! Let's get a move on.
OK! Take all the time you need to prepare.
