Moves that only select Pokémon can learn... They are called battle-combo moves. Do you want your Pokémon to learn one of them?
All right. Fair enough. If you want your Pokémon to learn one of my moves, just come back.
Oh, but none of the Pokémon you're with right now can learn my move. That's too bad!
Which Pokémon should learn my move?
<var> can't learn my move.
An Egg... I can't teach my move to an Egg.
<var> already knows my move.
Which move should be forgotten?
<var> learned <var>!
One...two...and...ta-da! <var> forgot <var>! And it learned <var> instead!
Battle-combo moves... How you combine them with each other is the key to using them well!
Did you get a Pokémon from the island kahuna or professor, maybe? It doesn't matter if it's evolved into something else since then. As long as it's a Fire-, Water-, or Grass-type Pokémon that new Trainers are given around here, and it's really friendly toward you, I'll teach it a special move—a battle-combo move.
A special move... Shall I teach your Pokémon a battle-combo move?
There is no move that I can teach to any of the Pokémon you are with...
I see... Well, see you next time.
Which Pokémon will it be, then?
That Pokémon can't learn a move from me.
Do you want me to teach my move to an Egg?! You are being unreasonable.
This Pokémon... It doesn't look like it's too comfortable with you yet.
That Pokémon already knows one of my moves.
Do you want me to teach <var> <var>?
My favorite Pokémon are all the Pokémon you get from people like professors or kahunas. I teach special moves—battle-combo moves—to those Pokémon and the Pokémon that evolve from them. That's what I do!
Please choose a move that will be replaced with <var>.
<var> did not learn <var>.
