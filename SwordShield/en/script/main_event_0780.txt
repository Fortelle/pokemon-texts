The Gym mission for the Fire Gym is this! Catching Pokémon to earn the most points!
Earn five points to clear the Gym mission! In case you were wondering, you'll earn one point for defeating a Pokémon in the tall grass or two points for catching a Pokémon. But you won't be alone in this competition. Other Trainers will be joining you in your battles!
Think about what your opponents might do, and try to take the best action to rack up points!
Now, let the Gym mission begin!
Did you need something?
What was the mission?
I want to withdraw
I'm good
Get five points to clear the mission! Defeating a Pokémon in the tall grass gets you one point, but catching a Pokémon gets you two!
If you withdraw, you'll have to start over the next time you give the mission a try. So, are you sure?
Then I look forward to your next attempt!
Well done! That's the way to clear a Gym mission!
Next you'll be facing Kabu, the leader of the Fire Gym! On you go, Challenger!
Right you are! Then on you go, Challenger!
A cautious one, are you? Get yourself all sorted first, in that case.
Then on with you! And good luck!
Gym mission start!
Gym mission completed!
Clearing Leader Kabu's Gym mission like that... You're positively on fire!
Congratulations on another mission cleared!

Now <var> more points needed to clear the Fire Gym mission! Keep that fire burning! (Gym Leader Kabu)



Challenger <var> claims <var> points!





Challenger <var> has already claimed himerself four points! Just one more to victory!

Oh my word, is Challenger <var> really going to end this thing with naught?!
Your target is the wild Pokémon! Don't concern yourself with the other Trainers!
The other Gym Trainers are all stronger than me! Be careful out there!
Status conditions are the greatest! Getting burned will land you in real hot water!
A Full Heal can cure any sort of status condition!
Study the situation, and choose your opponent wisely based on it!
We won't let you get through the Fire Gym's mission that easily!
