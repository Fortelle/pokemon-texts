I noticed something shiny on the ground while I was wandering the Wild Area, and so I went to investigate. Guess what I found? Star Pieces! A whole bunch of them! Here, you can have one, too!
You can sell Star Pieces for a good price at the Pok√© Marts. I've got my eye on some new clothes and a new hat already!
