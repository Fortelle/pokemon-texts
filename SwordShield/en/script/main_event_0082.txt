So it'll be <var> for you? Nice one!
Then I'll go with...<var>! You're mine!
I'm aiming to be the next Champion, so be ready! You and I'll be doing some serious training!
I bet you will be, Hop. That's why I brought along these Pokémon for you and <var>. So the two of you can battle and train and grow stronger together...to try to reach me!
And you'll come with me! Charizard will show you the ropes. He's strict—but real strong and real kind, too!



All right, enough of all this Trainer nonsense for one night! Dinner's ready, children. Bring along your Pokémon, and let's all eat!
