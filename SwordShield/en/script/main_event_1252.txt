I am Melony. As you can clearly see, I've assembled a team of all Ice-type Pokémon.
Well, fancy that! You made it all the way to me without falling in a hole. If I'm not careful, you could sweep my feet right out from under me.
You! You aren't sore all over from falling in a hole or two, are you? Even if you are, I'm not going to hold back!
All righty, I suppose we should get started. You won't be able to escape when I freeze you solid. And after that... Well, you'll see. I think you'll find my battle style is quite severe.
You... You're pretty good, huh? Of course seeing my Pokémon lose is sad, but to meet someone so young with such ability is quite grand.
Here, take this sparkling Ice Badge!
You can now catch Pokémon of up to Lv. 50!
For some reason, I can't help but imagine my son challenging you after you become the Champion. If that time comes...give him a right thrashing, would you?
<var>! My sincere congratulations for your victory over Gym Leader Melony. Please take this commemorative TM.
Here's a uniform for you, too. It's the same as what Melony wears, so it's a quite popular replica!
That Ice Badge looks great on you! Keep at it, Challenger <var>!
Do you want to go back to the reception area?
