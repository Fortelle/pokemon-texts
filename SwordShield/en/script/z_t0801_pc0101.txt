You... Don't you dare make Marnie's Morpeko cry, OK?
You... You know what to do when you battle against Marnie next time, right?
Well, you made it here, so I guess there's nothin' t'be done. You better be ready to face Piers!
Piers... He's not a big fan of Chairman Rose, but he really loves Gym Challenges.
Any Trainer who's made it all the way to Spikemuth's got a right wicked look to them!
Oh, well... I'll mime with Mr. Mime.

Daaak!
