Three days later...
So, Chairman Rose turned himself in, then? Never thought I'd live to see the day...
He awoke Eternatus and nearly caused a catastrophe for the entire region! You reap what you sow, I say.
I don't know about you, but I slept like the dead!
Everyone's still talking about what happened, but at least things are back to normal now. We really did defeat Eternatus together with Zamazenta and Zacian!
And still Lee's...well, he's being Lee. Insisting on having a Championship Match with you today. It's a bit much, isn't it? You sure you're up for it? I'm not even too sure about him. He was out cold and hurt pretty badly himself during all that mess.
I do understand how he feels, though. Feels like I've been waiting forever to get to see you and him face off in a serious match.
So come on! The match'll be at Wyndon Stadium. Where else!
