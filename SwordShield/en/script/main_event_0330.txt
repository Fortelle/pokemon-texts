It's morning at last! And time for our adventure to truly start!
Good morning to you, young Challengers.
Hop, is it true you really met some Pokémon you didn't recognize? Is there anything more you can tell me about it?
Er, well, there was weird heavy fog, and then this even weirder Pokémon appeared... <var> tried to fight it off! But then I think we both passed out or something. It's all pretty hazy.
A right fount of information you are.
<var>, Hop, these are for you.
You got a Dynamax Band from Professor Magnolia and slipped it on your wrist!
Those are your Dynamax Bands. I made them by fitting the Wishing Stars you found last night into those bands.
Thanks, Professor! This is brilliant! It's just like the one Lee has on him, too. Now we can Dynamax our Pokémon like he does!
My word, you don't waste any time, do you? I think you'll find it's not so simple as all that. There are a number of conditions you must meet if you hope to have your Pokémon Dynamax and take on that gigantic form.
Now, don't be afraid to go to all sorts of places and meet all sorts of Pokémon. That will help fill out your Pokédex, too.
The legend of my reign is finally about to begin!
Come on, <var>! I'll beat you to the station!






You will have the chance to meet many Pokémon and Trainers in the Wild Area. You may even encounter Dynamax Pokémon in such places. Put your faith in your partner, and push yourself to new heights together.
A strange Pokémon in the Slumbering Weald... I don't know... I've got an uneasy feeling for some reason...
