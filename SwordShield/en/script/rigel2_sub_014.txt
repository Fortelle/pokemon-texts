Words are carved into this ancient tombstone... "Spread my voice."
Is that a small sound coming from within the grave?
You can hear a faint voice coming from within the grave...
Did the gravestone just move a little bit?
You can sense a presence within... It feels like something could pop out at any time!
Words are carved into this ancient tombstone... "My voice has been heard."
