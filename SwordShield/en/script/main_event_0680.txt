Do not keep the chairman waiting. Head to the seafood restaurantâ€”the Captain's Table. So you will not forget the chairman's face, I will give you one of his League Cards.
Chairman Rose is the kind of man who gets downhearted if he doesn't take care of things he needs to right away... Go to the seafood restaurant as soon as possible, so as not to keep the chairman waiting.
