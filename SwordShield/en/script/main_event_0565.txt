Look! Just take a look at that, <var>! That's Turffield Stadium down there!
The Gym Leader just returned, too. Milo's his name. But the place is jam-packed with challengers. It'll be ages before our turn comes up...
Oh... But Sonia was looking for you, <var>. She wanted to ask you about something. She tried asking me, but I had no idea. She's up on that what's-her-face hill. You know the one.
What? You don't know the hill? Well, have a look at your map if you're not sure!
Bowow!
Oh! If it isn't Sonia's Yamper! He's a good boy. He'll show you the way!
Bow wark!
Bow wow wow!
Sonia's probably still waiting for you at the hill, <var>. Go on and meet her. You can't take on Milo yet anyway, and I don't want her griping to me later as if I didn't pass on the message!
