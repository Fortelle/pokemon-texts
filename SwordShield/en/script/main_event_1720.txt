Ladies and gentlemen, we're already at the second match of the Finals! Of the four remaining challengers, which two will be left for the last match?!
If you're just tuning in, ladies and gentlemen, we witnessed quite the surprise during the Finals here at this year's Champion Cup, as the former Gym Challenger Bede stormed the stage! But <var> was having none of it! This year's top challenger made quick work of him before washing away Gym Leader Nessa!
On the other side, we have... the Galar karate prodigy! Let's hear it for Gym Leader Bea, everybody!
I promise you, my attacks will shake your very soul this time.
May the best Trainer win.
Bea has been defeated! Challenger <var> has shown hiser skill!
Thank you for a wonderful match.
I really enjoyed battling you and your team... I'm upset that I lost, but I also feel so satisfied and so refreshed...
In a way, I guess you could say it was the best sort of match anyone could ever hope for.
I hope that you'll meet many more Trainers and have many more matches in the future. And I hope that every one of those encounters will nourish your spirit.
The next match will begin in no time, so stay in those seats, folks!
