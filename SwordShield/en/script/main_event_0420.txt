Would you take a look at this... The place is packed with Gym Challengers! Every one of these folks is another rival!
Seriously? What a piece of work...
Let's get signed up!
If you're here to register for the Gym Challenge, I'll need to see your endorsement, please.
Fancy that... This is the first time we've had a challenger endorsed by the Champion!
Well, now you've had two, because I am as well!
What?! Two of you at once?! I wonder what's come over Leon this year... The two of you must be something special.
I'm Hop! I'm Leon's little brother, in fact. And the next Champion. Get me all signed up, would you?
W-well, yes, I am trying to... If you'll just give me a moment...
There! You two have been successfully registered as Gym Challengers. You can now choose your preferred number for your uniform, if you'd be so kind? It will be displayed on the back of the uniform you must wear for any official match.
Number <var>, is it? Very well. And here. Please wear this Challenge Band at all times to identify yourself as a Gym Challenger.
The opening ceremony for the Gym Challenge is to be held here tomorrow. All the Trainers taking part have been booked a room at the nearby Budew Drop Inn.
That's the League Chairman for you! Even booked us all hotel rooms! I'm off to check out the fancy digs!
You're lookin' a bit gobsmacked by all this. You must be from some small country town, is that it? I'm quite the same myself.
I was endorsed by the chairman himself. In other words, among all those elite enough to get an endorsement, I'm the most elite of all. So why don't you clear off and not try talking to me again, would you? It's positively criminal of you, wasting the time of someone as important as I am.


If you're looking for the Budew Drop Inn, you'll find it's not far from the stadium. Head toward Route 3â€”it's along the way.
