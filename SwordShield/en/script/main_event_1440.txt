Hey there, <var>! You gave Raihan a good thrashing, and that means you've completed the Gym Challenge! Congratulations, from the bottom of my heart!
I really wish we could go celebrate, but I think there're some things we should talk over.
That light that covered Hammerlocke... It was just like the Darkest Day, where it's said that giant Pokémon went on a rampage and almost destroyed the entire Galar region.
It certainly seems to be that way, my dear. As you know, we Dynamax our Pokémon today using the energy from Wishing Stars that have fallen to us.
But we still don't know how to fully control the energy behind Dynamaxing or how the two heroes managed to do so. In fact, we're not even really sure who—or what— the two heroes actually were.
The legendary sword and shield...
Sonia, my dearest... My lab coat is yours now.
Are you sure, Gran? I still haven't finished the work you've assigned me.
Think of this as something to help you finish that work.
Professor Sonia!
It looks great!
Y-yeah!
The two heroes that protected the Galar region from the Darkest Day... And the legend of the sword and shield you just mentioned... It's up to you to figure out the truth behind it all.
I know, Gran!
I'll do what I can! You or Hop could be the one to take down Leon, and I don't want to miss that! Not to worry—you can count on me to take care of everything! You just focus on getting to Wyndon. Go on! Head to the station, or you'll miss your train!
The station's near Route 7, remember? Now, off with you, Gym Challenger!
There are things that only young people like you can do, and there are other things that should be left to the adults. Everyone has their own role.
