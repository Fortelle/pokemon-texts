Do you have an Armor Pass?
Hee hee! Of course! I totally have one!
Naturally. I have made all the proper preparations, which you can observe with unclouded eyes.
Please allow me to check your pass.
Slooo...
Oh, a Slowpoke!
Hmph. To meet a Slowpoke... Such a thing is simply elegant.
Uh-oh, looks like another one's gotten on the train and ridden over from the Isle of Armor.
Is this the first time you've seen a Galarian Slowpoke? The coloring of the top of its head is curry-like. Isn't it superduper cute?
Could this be your first time ever seeing a Galarian Slowpoke? Where they're from might be different, but they're still just as carefree as other Slowpoke.
There's a lot of Slowpoke living on the Isle of Armor. Not sure if they feel like traveling or what, but sometimes a few board the train.
