Grrr...

It's trying to suppress and calm itself, but it can't control all the power!
<var>...
I was hopin' we could just calm it down like we did with the others. But our opponent is a Legendary Pokémon. If you're thinkin' about catchin' it, think again.

I hate to admit it, but if anyone can stop it, it's got to be you, <var>!
I'll keep everyone else safe down here! So you don't have to worry about a thing! You just focus on calming down <var>!

Amazing... Absolutely incredible, <var>... I wonder if <var> is thanking you, too?
S-such a fearsome creature... And we thought we could control it as we pleased? Truly, we have been foolish fools!

My younger brother is unharmed. For that, you have my gratitude...
