I'm still not too sure what I should do about all that stuff I told you before... About me being weak and dragging down Lee's good name and all, yeah?
But the only thing I can do is get stronger, right? So I'm gonna try out all kinds of different things against you and see what works!
You're on!
Wait a second...
Then let's do this! I bet an all-out battle with my true rival will help me get my head on straight!
What? Your rival is depressed over here, and you won't lift a finger to help?
Hrmmm... I tried switching my team members in and out to max out their potential in every matchup, but... We just couldn't get it together somehow... Maybe that's why I'm still so weak...
But Lee really is the greatest Trainer! And I don't want people to be laughing at him all because his little brother is rubbish!
It's not enough! I've got to try harder! And harder and harder till no one's laughing! I'm off, mate! Off to find the kind of Pok√©mon that I can really draw the strength out of!
