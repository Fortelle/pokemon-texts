Some advice for you, <var>. The Gym Challenge has a set order you'll need to follow.
So that means your next stop should be in Hulbury to meet Nessa. Hulbury's just beyond Route 5. Or since you've got the Grass Badge, you could head to the Wild Area. It's a bit tricky to catch Pokémon that are a higher level than the Pokémon on your team, but they make powerful allies if you succeed!
