Congratulations, <var>!
You've beat even the unbeatable Champion— making you the new Champion of the region!
You've become a first-rate Trainer, all right.
I offer you my heartfelt congratulations!
And now that you've grown so strong, perhaps it's time I started looking ahead myself.
It's time we adults started working on improving the here and now, for the sake of all that's to come!
And you, <var>! What you ought to do now is...
believe in yourself and your partner Pokémon, and keep on blasting ahead!
In order to create that bright future we all hope to see!
People of Galar!
Here you have it! A new legend born right before your eyes!
Your Champion, <var>!
Bet you can't wait to see what kind of future a kid with this kind of strength might bring about!
I sure can't! Let's watch and see what she can do!
