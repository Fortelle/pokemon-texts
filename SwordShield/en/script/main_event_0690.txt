<var>! Let's celebrate your recent victory!
Oh, were you invited, too?
You two know each other? That's great! Come now—please be seated.
Hulbury is a seafood town. Naturally, if one is going to eat here, the obvious choice is the local cuisine! Everything on the menu is delicious.
By the way, how is Professor Magnolia getting on?
I'm quite indebted to her, you know. She was the one who figured out how to unleash the power of Wishing Stars and use that power to Dynamax Pokémon. We would never have been able to create Dynamax Bands without her.
*sigh* She was saying that there's still so much we don't know about Dynamaxing. It's causing her some worry.
She even made me take a Power Spot Detector with me when I started traveling...
A Power Spot Detector! That's the device that allowed me to discover the Power Spots... Locations that emit Galar particles and allow Pokémon to Dynamax!
I don't like hearing that Professor Magnolia is so worried, though. If only there were something I could do...
Sonia, it may be good for you to visit the vault in Hammerlocke. I believe the key to unlocking the secrets of the Dynamax phenomenon lies in the history preserved there.
Understood, Chairman. I will arrange a meeting with Ms. Sonia.
However, I believe it is about time we get going, Chairman.
Hm? But I've hardly had a chance to speak with <var>! It's regrettable, but I suppose it can't be helped. If something needs to get done, there's no time like the present, after all! In any case, I bid you all farewell!
*sigh* Does he think he's doing me a favor? He's right that the vault would be a good place to look for info on the legends, but...
You got the Water Badge, yeah? Defeating Nessa's no small feat. Here's a TM as a reward!
Nessa's a good friend. Perhaps I should drop in on her. Until next time, Gym Challenger!
