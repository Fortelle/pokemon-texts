Thank you so much for participating in the Rotom Rally! Here's a little souvenir for you, as a sign of my gratitude!
If you let me give your bike some extra power, I can make it charge up the turbo boost faster! It'll cost you <var> W, though. Is that OK?
If you let me give your bike more power, I can help the turbo boost charge up even faster! It'll cost you <var> W, though. Is that OK?
If you let me give your bike even more power, I can increase its turbo-boost charge speed to the maximum! It'll cost you <var> W, though. Is that OK?
All right, your bike has extra power! Since your turbo boost charges faster now, why not have another go at the Rotom Rally?
