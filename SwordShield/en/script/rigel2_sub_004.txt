Oi oi! It's me, Peony! Listen—I wanted to ask you somethin'...

They're sayin' dodgy bird Pokémon are poppin' up left and right!
There's this pointy-feathered one in the Wild Area!
Plus a fiery-lookin' one out on the Isle of Armor!
And this fancy, graceful one's apparently flyin' about the Crown Tundra!

Oi oi! It's me, Peony! How's your expeditionin' goin'?
Come again? You've found the Legendary Pokémon <var>?!
Gahahaaa! That's really somethin'! Now go track down the other bird Pokémon!
