Wyndon is quite massive, so it can be a frightful headache to find your way around. Best to use the monorail or ring up a Flying Taxi.


We get heaps of tourists here in Wyndon, so I change up the menu to cater to their tastes.
You get so caught up in the action of the matches when you're in the stadium that you forget to eat!
I want to do an entire loop of the Galar region! What better way to start than the Ferris wheel?
A Ferris wheel... But I'm afraid of heights!
So according to this, you can't reach Rose Tower unless you take the monorail...
Certain Pokémon species love the train rails... They can cause rather amusing trouble at times!
You can see one of Wyndon's famous monorail platforms right this way! The monorail goes round and round the city! It's a dizzying delight!
Ki dee dee!
My Pokémon love music more than just about anything else! When they hear anything with a sick beat, they can't stand still. They're off like a shot!
Ziggy!
Zaggy!
