Welcome, Gym Challenger. I'm Bea.
Do you have an unshakable spirit that won't be moved, no matter how you are attacked? I think I'll just test that out, shall I?
Thank you for the battle.
Phew... Facing you gave me all the explanation I needed.
Battling against you and your team... I hadn't expected it, but it made my heart dance. It's good to be unshakable in the face of battle. But it's good to be moved by battle, as well.
Thank you again. Take the Fighting Badge.
You can now catch Pok√©mon of up to Lv. 40!
I hope that you'll meet many more Trainers and have many more matches in the future. And I hope that every one of those encounters will nourish your spirit.
Challenger <var>! Congratulations on defeating Leader Bea! Please take this TM to remember your victory by!
And take one of our Fighting Gym uniforms as well, as a souvenir.
The Fighting Badge suits you, <var>. I hope you'll carry on just as you've been doing!
Do you want to go back to the reception area?
