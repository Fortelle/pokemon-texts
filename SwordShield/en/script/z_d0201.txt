Hiya! Me and my little sister have set ourselves up as a pop-up Pokémon Center service. Not that we asked anyone if we could or should. Galar Mine is pretty rough on a team, isn't it? I'll heal up your Pokémon for you, friend.
Come talk to me anytime you think your team needs a bit of care!
Welcome to our pop-up Pokémon Center! You want your team healed up again?
Thanks for waiting! Your <var> should be all better now!

Hiya! Me and my big sister have set ourselves up as a pop-up Pokémon Center service. Not that we asked anyone if we could or should. You've done a good job making it this far. I'll heal your team up for you!
Once you get through Galar Mine, you're out on Route 4—and nearly to Turffield! You're almost there, Gym Challenger!
