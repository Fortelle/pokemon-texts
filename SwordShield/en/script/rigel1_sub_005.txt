I'm completely obsessed with moves. Under the supervision of my master, I've been developing new Pokémon moves day and night.
I've spent a lot of time developing many moves.


I'll teach your Pokémon a move for a small token of gratitude...
Shall I teach your Pokémon a move for five pieces of Armorite Ore?
Which Pokémon do you want me to teach a move to?
You don't have enough Armorite Ore... I mean, gratitude.
Please obtain Armorite Ore in Max Raid Battles on the Isle of Armor.
Turning down my offer so firmly... That's a move that children are good at.
Then I'll take your Armorite Ore... I mean, gratitude.
If you want me to teach your Pokémon a move, come back with a small token of gratitude.
