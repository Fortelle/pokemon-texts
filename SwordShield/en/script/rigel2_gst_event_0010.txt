<var>! At last!
...Hello, hello? You there? This is <var>'s Rotom Phone, right?
Brilliant! I asked Hop for your number. I'm glad he didn't pull anything funny, like giving me the wrong one...
Ack! Sorry about that! Looks like I've got the wrong number... Though your voice does sound awfully familiar, I've got to say... Hang on—<var>! It really is you, isn't it?! You're as bad as Hop, you rascal!
Oh, sorry. Guess I should've said who was calling you, eh?
It's me, Leon! Sorry if I took you aback!
But rest assured, there can only be a pretty good reason for me to call you out of the blue like this.
The former Champion of Galar has a favor to ask of the current Champion... And that's you, <var>!
Come on over to Wyndon Stadium, and I'll tell you all the details!
I'll head that way myself now—and I swear I won't take any detours or get lost!
