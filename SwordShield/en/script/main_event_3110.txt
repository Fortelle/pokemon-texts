You all! Did you come to lend us a hand?
...Oh. You. You came to help me?
Eh, somethin' like that. How're things lookin'?
We just finished getting everyone to safety, so I was about to challenge the Dynamax Pokémon...
The people all got out... But I'm the Gym Leader... I'll...battle the Dynamax Pokémon!


Nice one! Then let's all work together!
I give you my most heartfelt thanks!
That'd... That'd be brilliant, thanks!
We've got several opponents, so we may as well take one each. I'll be counting on you all!
There are loads of 'em... I hope everyone...can take one each. Please!
Here we go!
...Let's go!



I can't thank you all enough. With your help, the Dynamax Pokémon have all been returned to normal.
...Th-thanks. A lot. The Pokémon have all calmed down...
I'll keep them safe here in the stadium, so no need to worry.
They can rest here... They...should be fine in time...
<var>. Next time I'll be the one who saves you in your hour of need. Give me a call if you're ever in a rough spot.
<var>... Here... My League Card.
If there are other places that need a Champion's help, please go look after them!
...Y-you can leave things here to me.
I'll protect the peace of Stow-on-Side Stadium with all my might!
...I-I'd rather you go help those who need you!
