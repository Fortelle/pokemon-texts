The tense, still air on the pitch... And the exact opposite from the audience, cheering and yelling... They're both fantastic, wouldn't you say?
But remember, the audience is also a bit cruel... They want nothing more than to see one of us lose, after all!
It can fill you with fear knowing that, but I absolutely love pushing past the fear. I love giving it everything I've got as a Trainer and seeing my team give everything they've got to seize another victory! It's the greatest feeling in the world, and I can't get enough of it!
I can feel my partners itching with anticipation inside their Poké Balls... We're going to have a real champion time!
I'm the Galar region's Champion, Leon! Me and Charizard, and all the rest of our team, will use all our knowledge and experience to crush you completely!
Wait—hold on!
Hey! Look at the monitor!
What is that on the big screen...?
