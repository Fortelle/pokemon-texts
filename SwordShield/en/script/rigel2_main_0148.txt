Brrrrm... Rrrrm...
Stop!
Wait!
Brrrrrriiiiiice!
Sheeeighhhhd!
Brrrm... Brm...
Neeeighce!
Braaark!
Eek!
Cra-crown!
Brr?!
Brrriiice!
Sheighhhhd!
Are you all right?!
Y-yes... I feel like something stepped in to save me...
Oh, kind visitor! How could I possibly thank you enough for saving the people of this village?
I had no idea such a vicious Pokémon still existed in the tundra...
Why, it reminded me of that Pokémon in the fairy tales... The loyal steed of the king...
Ah, but no doubt I am overthinking things.
Hmm? What is that you have there? Is that a tuft of White Mane Hair?
Hmm? What is that you have there? Is that a tuft of Black Mane Hair?
In the fairy tales, it is said that by weaving the hair of the loyal steed together with a radiant blossom grown by the king...
it is possible to create the Reins of Unity, which link the king with its steed!
In fact, it was my own ancestors who used to weave the Reins of Unity, following an ancient tradition passed down over many years.
Of course, I myself have never seen any kind of radiant flower, and the method of making the reins has also been lost to time.
In any case, we can't spend all day musing over fairy tales!
I must make plans and preparations. That Pokémon could well decide to pay us another visit, after all!
Thank you very much for your help, kind traveler!
Hey... Thanks for saving us.
Was that Pokémon really the one from the fairy tales? It looked very similar to be sure, but...
Thank goodness you happened to pass by! You really saved the day!
When that Pokémon was about to run into us, I just got this feeling that...some other Pokémon wearing a crown stepped in to save us.
Things have quieted down. I guess the festival's over now?
