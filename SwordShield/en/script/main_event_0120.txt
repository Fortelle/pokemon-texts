I already want to get stronger and stronger! You've seen me battle now, Lee, so come on— you've gotta let me take on the Pokémon Gyms!
You? Join the Gym Challenge? You think you're ready for the single greatest competition in the Galar region? Not putting the cart before the Rapidash there, Little Brother?
If that's really what you want to do, you two have a whole lot you need to learn about Pokémon.
Especially your friend <var>. Before you think about getting Gym Badges, best to think about getting a Pokédex.
A Trainer's Pokédex helps them learn lots of things about all the Pokémon out there, including their strengths. But it's more than just a collection of data, you know. It's a record of a Trainer's love and passion for Pokémon training!
Right, right, we get it... Pokédexes, then! We're on it! Looks like it's off to the Pokémon Research Lab for you and me, <var>!
That's the kind of enthusiasm a Trainer needs! I'll let the professor know to expect you.
I'm going to be the next Champion, so completing a simple Pokédex will be nothing! Just another page in the tale of my legend!
You'd probably better go tell your mum that we're heading out, though.
You've found yourself a perfectly lovely partner, haven't you? Congratulations, dear.
