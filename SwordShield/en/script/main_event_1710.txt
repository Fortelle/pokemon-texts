The time for waiting is over! The Finals of the Champion Cup are about to begin! The two Trainers to face each other in the first battle of the first round are...
A Trainer endorsed by the Champion himself, Challenger <var>!
Hiser opponent is... the raging wave! The master of Water types, Nessa!
I can tell you've grown far stronger since you faced me in Hulbury Stadium. I've got to hand it to our undefeated Champion. He's got a proper eye for talent, too.
But you're not the Champion, and you'll never become the Champion, either. Do you know why? It's because I, Nessa, am going to defeat both you and Leon!
I'm not going to underestimate you again. I'll use Dynamax to wash you out to sea and beyond the horizon!
Aaaaaand the winner is...<var>! HShe defeated Nessa during the Gym Challenge and now has pulled it off again!
You and your Pok√©mon are just too much... Even with my Dynamaxed partner, you weathered our waves and stood firm.
Now that I think about it, Sonia was saying something about how amazing you were. I wish I'd paid more attention to what she was talking about.
I bet everyone in Galar's got their eyes on you now. You defeated my team, so now you've got to ride that current all the way to the end!
Now...don't go anywhere, ladies and gentlemen! The second battle of the first round will begin shortly!
