The next evening...
This is it. Did you get enough sleep?
You and your team are the ones battling, but I've had Butterfree in my stomach since I woke up...
Challenger <var>? The Finals will be starting shortly. I'm here to escort you to the stadium.
What's all this! Didn't learn your lesson yesterday?! If you need another helping of Hop and his trusty <var>, I'll be happy to give you one!
No! Wait, please! I'm not like those other League staff! I'm a good one! If I may say so myself...
I heard about what happened yesterday. Ms. Oleana can be a little extreme in her desire to assist the chairman with his goals, I'm afraid.
It seems she was cultivating her own group of League staff in secret to be deployed for... well...things like that debacle last night.
But you've no need to worry about today's staff! All of us are here for the right reasons.
Well, that's what she says... I guess we trust her, then, yeah, <var>? Let's go! I can't wait another minute!
Would you like me to show you the way to Wyndon Stadium?
Then let's be on our way!
Understood. Come talk with me again if you need any help, or use one of the Flying Taxis out front.
