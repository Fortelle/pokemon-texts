Hm? There's something written on the door... "A giant of rock."
"A giant of ice."
"A giant of steel."
"When gather the three giants, the door of destiny shall be opened."
Something changed in the air...
An electric power is emanating from the Pokémon statue... Do you want to check it out?
A draconic power is emanating from the Pokémon statue... Do you want to check it out?
Zizi zizizi.
Zagd.
Regieleki stopped moving again.
Regidrago stopped moving again.

The huge Pokémon statue is looking down at you.
Better report back to Chief Peony!
It looks like once you check this, you won't be able to reset the switches on the floor.
Are you sure you want to set the switches in the electric pattern?
Are you sure you want to set the switches in the dragon pattern?
It seems you didn't press the switches quite right...
