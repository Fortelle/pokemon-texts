Hammerlocke's stadium doubles as an Energy Plant.
Now, have a look at my tablet. I've got all the information you need on it.
See? An easy-to-understand description of the Energy Plant!
First, energy is absorbed from Hammerlocke Stadium's tower...
Then, it's changed into electricity in the underground power plant and delivered to people throughout the region!
Our lives and society require various types of energy sources, such as electricity, natural gas, and water.
My associate groups aim to improve everyone's lives by harnessing the power stored in Wishing Stars!
Oh! It's time for me to get to work. I should get a move on before Oleana decides to give me another earful.
<var>, I suggest you head over to the vault next. Just head toward Route 6 from the stadium, and you should find the vault without any issues!
