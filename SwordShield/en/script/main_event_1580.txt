Man, why am I here for this? I'm totally exhausted from that battle with you, <var>...
We decided that Team Yell will cheer you on, <var>. Let's help out together.
What a beautiful display of sibling love! However, it is entirely unnecessary.
Ms. Oleana?
Chairman Rose is with the Champion in a very, very important meeting...
There is no way I will let anyone interfere!
After all, only authorized personnel with the proper key can ride the monorail to Rose Tower.
That means as long as Chairman Rose is in the tower, no one can disturb him!
I have hand selected a member of the League staff and given them a key. Chairman Rose does enjoy these kind of menial games after all.
Do you think you can tell the difference between normal League staff and the one I chose?
Do you think you can find me?
What should we do?
Tch. This isn't good! But I got this one!
<var>! Team Yell's yellin' will handle this!
No. This is brilliant! I'll search around the front of the stadium!
For now, we should try to head to the plaza together, right?
All right, let's all work together and head for Rose Tower.
Hmm. You should be able to get to the plaza yourself, right?
