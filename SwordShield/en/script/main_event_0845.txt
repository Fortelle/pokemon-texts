Ah, a Gym Challenger! Allow me to check your Gym Badges!
The Grass Badge!
The Water Badge!
And the Fire Badge!
You've made it through Motostoke, Turffield, and Hulbury! Keep up the pace!
Oh, it's you... I doubt Hop will be coming.
It's only natural. After such a humiliating defeat, there's no way he could look the Champion in the eye. I'm sure he'll withdraw from the challenge.
Here, just look at the Gym Badges I've already won.
Anyway, I have a meeting with the chairman, so I must excuse myself.
Hmm? You don't have the Fire Badge yet. You can't enter without the Fire Badge. Would you like me to take you back to the bridge at the Motostoke Riverbank?
Of course. In that case...
Please don't overexert yourself.
