Hmm? You got four Gym Badges already? I'm gonna have to watch out for you, huh?
Urara. â™ª
Look, even Morpeko is wary of you.
Wait, Morpeko, don't tell me you actually like <var>?
Ugh! We've already had a serious battle with himer. HShe's an opposin' Gym Challenger! Guess there's nothin' to it. Look, just take one of my League Cards, OK?
What's with that look, huh? This just means I'll think of you as my rival from now on, OK? There aren't too many Gym Challengers left, y'know. So we're meetin' in the Finals. You got that?
