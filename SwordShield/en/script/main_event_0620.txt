Oi! Just hand over that bike already! We need it to cross this long bridge!
We're gonna use that bike to chase around Gym Challengers! It'll be a scream!
How barbaric! It wouldn't work anyway. You don't even have a Rotom with you!
Hey, young Gym Challenger! They're trying to steal my bike! Please, if you could give them a good thrashing, I would be in your debt!
Oi, we're not tryin' to steal the bike! Only borrow it! We're gonna use it to chase after Gym Challengers and make 'em all tired! But I'm thinkin' you deserve a special shout-out. I'm gonna crush you in a battle!
Gah... You crushed my attempt to crush you.
Why you... I want that bike! Don't get in my way!
You're too strong! If you stay in the Gym Challenge, you're gonna cause problems for our lady! You 'aven't seen the last of us! We're gonna make sure you stay out of our lady's way!
My word, you're quite the Trainer! And I see you have a Pokédex, too! That means you have a Rotom with you! Fantastic! I think I'll give this bike to you, then. Better you have it than Team Yell!
Now, you know that Rotom love motors very, very much, right? Enough to jump right into machines that have motors! So, that got me thinking... If I attached a motor to a bicycle, then maybe I could get a Rotom to pop into that as well!
Right...
I see
Come now—give it a shot! Enjoy cycling together with Rotom to the fullest.
Chop, chop, come on now! You and Rotom ride that bicycle together!
I'll read the manual. "Press the + Button or - Button to ride your bike with Rotom. Let's get cycling!"
