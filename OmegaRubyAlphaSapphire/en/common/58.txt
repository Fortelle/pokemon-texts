I went to the Poké Mart in <var> the other day for some <var>. I ended up buying just <var>, though of them!
The other day I went to the Pokémon Day Care to pick up the <var> I'd left there. It had leveled up all the way to Lv. <var>. That was a real surprise!
I actually won <var> playing at the Loto-ID Center the other day!
Inverse Battles sure are tough, aren't they? I tried one the other day, and no way could I have won if I hadn't had <var> with me!
You know about Moomoo Milk, yeah? You normally buy <var> at a time, right?
I love growing things like <var>! I harvested <var> the other day. Are you farming Berries, too?

If it's my awesome <var>, I'm pretty sure it could win in any <var>... What do you think?

When I bought <var> in <var> a while ago, another dropped down for free! That's some kind of luck, right?
