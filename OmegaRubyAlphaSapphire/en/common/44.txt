Can you see that? Right in front of you! That giant right there is a Balloon Bot! "Secrets to Super Training Success: Hit those goals before you get hit!" Use the Circle Pad on your Nintendo 3DS to move your Pokémon around the virtual space! Tap and drag on the lower screen to both aim and shoot a special ball at the goal! Aim for the white goals that appear in front of the Balloon Bots, and shoot like mad! Good luck! Time to work out!
Hey, champ! We've been waiting for you! This time I'll teach you about a secret, special way to shoot in your Super-Training Regimens! "Secrets to Super Training Success: Energy Shots for the win, baby! Get 'em!" You see that round meter down low in the middle of your Nintendo 3DS system's upper screen? That special meter shows you how much energy your Pokémon has—its oomph! When you're full of that energy, the shots you let loose transform into Energy Shots! Energy Shots will vary by Pokémon, and they'll even look different when you see 'em! They're the way to really win! Good luck! Time to work out!
"Secrets to Super Training Success: Keep an eye out for the opponent's shots!" When a shot from a Balloon Bot hits you, you'll lose some of the points you earned! If you reach the time limit without enough points, it'll be game over for your regimen! Use the Circle Pad to move and get away from incoming shots! Can you dodge 'em all?! Well, you're about to find out! Good luck! Time to work out!
"Secrets to Super Training Success: Aim for bonus goals while you still can!" The white goals that appear in front of Balloon Bots disappear after one hit, OK? But red goals are special bonus goals you earn, and they won't disappear after one hit! Hit 'em again and again and again—until they disappear after a set amount of time! You ready for another regimen? Good luck! Time to work out!
"Secrets to Super Training Success: Keep an eye out for the opponent's shots!" When a shot from a Balloon Bot hits you, you'll lose some of the points you earned! If you reach the time limit without enough points, it'll be game over for your regimen! Use the Circle Pad to move and get away from incoming shots! Can you dodge 'em all?! Well, you're about to find out! Good luck! Time to work out!
"Secrets to Super Training Success: Focus, and predict your opponent's moves!" When goals appear on the arms, wings, or other moving bits of Balloon Bots, taking aim is no longer a simple matter! Will you study how the Balloon Bots move before letting loose your shots? Or are you the type to use wild potshots?! Good luck! Time to work out!

Will you study how the Balloon Bots move before letting loose your shots? Or are you the type to use wild potshots?! Good luck! Time to work out!
"Secrets to Super Training Success: Don't let a single goal get away unhit!" When several goals appear at once, it is your chance to get in some serial hits! Take aim at each, and be sure to hit it! It's the trick to beating a regimen in a flash! I hope you're ready to go! Good luck! Time to work out!
"Secrets to Super Training Success: Use barriers to guard yourself in a pinch!" Sometimes you simply cannot dodge an opponent's shots. Here's what to do then! Press the L Button, and you'll be able to throw up a barrier to protect yourself! This barrier will keep any opponent's shots from hitting you for a short period of time! But you can't keep using your barrier nonstop, so don't go wasting it! Ready that L Button! Good luck! Time to work out!
"Secrets to Super Training Success: Let 'er fly! Release that Charged Shot!" If you keep your stylus pressed to the Touch Screen, your Pokémon will be enveloped by a special, glowing aura! While that aura is burning bright, lift the stylus from the Touch Screen, and boom! You'll let loose with a super-high-power Charged Shot that'll net you triple points! But be careful—if you wait too long, your aura will fizzle out and disappear! You ready to give it a shot? Good luck! Time to work out!

"Secrets to Super Training Success: Bust through the Bitbots to win!" Bitbots are small, AI-powered bots that Balloon Bots can summon at will! These lovable little bits of errant data can act as a shield to protect their parent Balloon Bot. And even when you defeat them, give 'em enough time, and they'll regenerate on you! Do you think you're ready for them? Good luck! Time to work out!

"Secrets to Super Training Success: Break down the opponent's barriers!" When a Balloon Bot is surrounded by a barrier, none of your Pokémon's shots will hit it! But barriers aren't invincible, and you can knock 'em down if you try hard enough! Ready to find the crack in those defenses? Good luck! Time to work out!

"Secrets to Super Training Success: What in the world is Circuit Training?!" Circuit Training! It is a brutal regimen that features two or more Balloon Bots in a row! The way each Balloon Bot moves may be different, so keep your eyes peeled! Are you ready to take on this parade?! Good luck! Time to work out!
"Secrets to Super Training Success: To the speediest go the spoils!" You've probably noticed by now, but clearing a Secret Super-Training Regimen gets you items, as well as regular training bags! And there's more—if you clear a regimen a lot faster than the set target time, you'll have a better chance at getting a rare item! Think you can do it? Good luck! Time to work out!

"Secrets to Super Training Success: Watch out for that furious counter!" The Balloon Bot you face in this regimen will get faster as you get more points. Its shots get more powerful, too! Its moves may change suddenly, so keep a steady head! I hope you're ready for this challenge! Good luck! Time to work out!
"Secrets to Super Training Success: Strike first and fast if you want to win big!" The Balloon Bot you face in this regimen lets off quick, ferocious shots from the start! As you get more points, though, it will start to get a bit sluggish, so hit it first to win! I hope you're ready for this challenge! Good luck! Time to work out!

"Secrets to Super Training Success: Discover the thrill of a one-hit game over!" The Balloon Bot you will face in this regimen shoots off incredibly strong shots!

Are you ready for this challenge? Good luck! Time to work out!
