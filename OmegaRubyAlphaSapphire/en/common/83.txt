This is an HNN special report. The "Peeko-napping" incident that became a top headline not long ago has been resolved thanks to the brave actions of one young Trainer. Peeko's Trainer, a Mr. Briney, aged 72, responded to inquiries that the Trainer in question is a "real catch," stating that he expects this precocious do-gooder to become a big hit in the future. I'm sure we at HNN will be keeping our eyes on this young hero's future!
This is an HNN special report. We have a new update regarding the strange attack on the Oceanic Museum's director, Captain Stern, aged 57, by parties unknown. We are just now getting reports that the situation has been resolved peacefully. Captain Stern had this to say about being suddenly set upon by a group unknown to him. "Just when I thought things might be over for me, that young boygirl ran into the fray, showing amazing Poké Ball technique. HShe got into the thick of it with hiser team, putting those criminals, or whoever they were, on the run." This was Captain Stern's description of his savior, who we have learned is in fact the very same Trainer who we reported on previously during the Peeko case. We will be sure not to lose sight of this hot young hero here at HNN!

This is an HNN special report. We have breaking news about a kidnapping case now unfolding. Noted meteorite researcher Professor Cozmo, 40, of Fallarbor Town, has been abducted by unknown parties, according to breaking reports. A woman working as the professor's assistant says that the professor has a habit of acting recklessly when it comes to his pursuit of meteorites, and she has expressed fears that he may have been tricked by some criminal element. We, too, are concerned for the professor's safety.

This is an HNN special report. We've had word of a special young man who has been defeating Gym after Gym around the Hoenn region.

This is an HNN special report. Professor Birch, aged 35, the leading figure in Pokémon research, has announced a new theory regarding Pokémon diversity. Birch: "Thanks to the fieldwork that I conduct with the aid of my young daughter, we can say with some certainty that Hoenn's Pokémon population was more diverse over 1,000—no, 3,000— years ago than it is today. It seems that the Hoenn region was a more hospitable environment for Pokémon long ago." Hm, 3,000 years ago... Just how many Pokémon did live in this region? We have high hopes that Professor Birch's continuing research will provide the answers.

Interviewer: Greetings! How are all our viewers doing out there? It's time for Today's Smart Shopper! Today, I've come to this great shop in <var> to ask which items have been flying off the shelves lately. Let's ask one of the staff right now! So, what's your number-one seller?
Clerk: Well, thank you for asking. I'd say that <var> have been selling really well lately. I even had this one Trainer named <var> come in the other day to buy <var> of them!
Interviewer: Phew! It takes some deep pockets to buy up <var> <var> at once! I bet that <var> of yours was getting ready for an adventure! I know I always want to have <var> or <var> for any journey that I'm on!
Interviewer: Oh, that reminds me! Speaking of <var>, I bought one myself the other day. <var> are handy and wonderful and, well... They're just great to have on you!
Interviewer: Really? <var>? And <var> of them?! I never even imagined that anyone would buy so many at once. I never buy more than one or two at a time myself.
Interviewer: I remember one time, way back when, I bought a whole lot of <var>, too. But I had so many left over that I ended up with real buyer's regret. Now I just try to buy what I need. Oops! But I guess talking about myself doesn't really help!
Clerk: Well, it was a really great sale, so I guess it's natural to want to stock up!
Interviewer: Hmm, hmmm... I guess that <var> must really know how to spot a deal. Let's see, the total for that purchase was... Just $<var>?! Whoa! That really was a great deal! Well, that's all we have time for today, but catch us again for more of the best deals! Bye for now, bargain hunters!
The time has come for the latest episode of The Name Rater Show! Using the nickname bestowed on a Pokémon, I will tell its fortune! Today's guest is <var>, with <var> nicknamed <var>! Now let me see... Mm-hmm... Oh, yes. Hmm... This Pokémon's nickname tells me...
That this Pokémon has a great penchant for battle! Indeed! Even when you think it might lose, this Pokémon won't give up! It'll strike fear into opponents with a vibe that says, "You're gonna miss!"
That this Pokémon will be very spoiled by its Trainer! What a life! It always wants <var> to fuss over it and care for it. And yet I also get the feeling that... Yes, the sounds of <var> tell me that you should definitely give this Pokémon a lot of love in Pokémon-Amie!
That this Pokémon has quite a bit of happiness waiting for it! If it uses Thunder in battle, it'll succeed about 70 percent of the time! Yes... That's right. It's quite average, isn't it? <var> is a pretty average nickname, after all. What it all boils down to is that being average is no bad thing!
That it is one thoughtful Pokémon! That's what kind of name it has. If you put this one in a contest, I don't know why exactly, but I think it could show off its appeal at just the right time to excite the crowd. Yup, that's what "<var>" suggests to me anyhow. It makes me think of an old couple.
That this Pokémon is destined to have some ups and downs in life! I'd say that the future in store for it will be anything but mediocre! This name is like when you finally meet a Shiny Pokémon in the wild— and then you knock it out with a critical hit! Arrrghhh! Yup, that's what "<var>" sounds like to my ears. I see lots of drama for this one.
The name "<var>." Well, <var>, I have to say that nickname seems a bit lacking in the love department, you know? If you want to understand your <var> a bit better, how about renaming it "<var>"? With the same name, maybe you'd understand your Pokémon as much as you understand yourself!
The name "<var>" really captures the love you have for your Pokémon, <var>! My, my... How can I say this? It's like... It's like, <var>, <var> completes you. <var> supports you a lot, doesn't it? You have noticed that, right? You'd better notice it!
This nickname, well... You did spend <var> seconds on deciding it, so I guess that tells you all you need to know! <var>, you really put a lot into that name, didn't you?
But you know, <var>, I've got to say that you pick some fine nicknames for your Pokémon. I hope you'll continue looking after <var> with as much care as you clearly put into its name. I hope fate has it in store for us to meet again!

Li'l MC: So then, lemme see... I went right ahead and asked, and... It seems like making <var>-dexes is what's really on fire!
Vet MC: Ho ho! Maybe I'll check out one of those schools for myself! But what kind of schools are they?
Vet MC: Ho ho! Maybe I'll have to hold one of those parties for myself! But what kind of parties are they?
Vet MC: Ho ho! Maybe I'll try to become one of those masters myself! But a master of what exactly?
Vet MC: Ho ho! Maybe I'll head out to visit one of those festivals myself! But what kind of festivals are they?
Vet MC: Ho ho! Maybe I'll try out some moves for myself! But what kind of dances are they?
Vet MC: Ho ho! Maybe I'll try my own hand at one of those songs! But what kind of songs are they?
Vet MC: Ho ho! Maybe I'll start one of those trendy collections for myself! But what are they collecting for?
Vet MC: Ho ho! Maybe I'll pursue that kind of quality for myself! But what kind of quality is it?
Vet MC: Ho ho! Maybe I'll try renovating one of those houses myself! But what kind of houses are they?
Vet MC: Ho ho! Maybe I'll try to compile a dex like that for myself! But what kind of dex is it?
Li'l MC: That's what I want to know, too! Let's see for ourselves! We're off for that trendy town of Dewford to find out more!
Vet MC: All right! Now I'll finally be able to be as cool as <var>, too!
Li'l MC: Sure you can! This has been Trend Shoot! I hope none of you watching miss out on the next big wave of trends! See ya on the other side!

<var>'s sneaky steps were beautiful and light! I think it only took <var> seconds to reach that Pokémon!
<var> is quite the cautious one. HShe's taking hiser time to approach slowly.
But then... <var> walked right on by! <var>! Oh, <var>! How blind are you?! Wasn't it in your field of vision? Couldn't you see that cute <var>?! I bet you're just the kind of Trainer who complains about how they can never meet new Pokémon! I'm so disappointed!
And so <var> walked on incredibly slowly! One step...and then another... <var> is being so careful! And that's why... That's why... it got away! <var> looked a bit sad as she watched the <var> fade into the distance.
Then a Lv. <var> <var> was encountered... The <var> was driven back by a powerful attack, though! Being a strong Trainer is lovely, but you end up expecting more from your opponents. Hopefully we can all find that one special Pokémon someday!
Then <var> finally found that one special Lv. <var> <var>! They fell for each other the moment they met! The <var> looked so happy going into the Poké Ball!
Then <var> met a Lv. <var> <var>. It looks like our fearless Trainer was driven back by a fierce attack! Seeing <var> run for the Pokémon Center was a bit sad.
Then <var> finally found that one special level <var> <var>! <var> ran away, though! I was so disappointed! Pokémon are nothing to be scared of! They're just waiting for you to approach them!
Then <var> finally found that one special Lv. <var> <var>! Although the only one who thought so might have been <var>! That <var> ran away in flash! Of course, I just felt so sorry for himer that I couldn't find the words to say.
