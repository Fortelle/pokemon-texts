There are many types of Pokémon. All types have their strengths and weaknesses against other types. Some battles will be easier or harder based on the types of your Pokémon.
For example, your Treecko is a Grass type. It's strong against Water and Ground types. But it's weak against Fire types.
For example, your Torchic is a Fire type. It's strong against Grass and Bug types. But it's weak against Water types.
For example, your Mudkip is a Water type. It's strong against Fire types. But it's weak against Grass and Electric types.
