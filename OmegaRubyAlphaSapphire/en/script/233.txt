Uh... Oh yes! I'm the Move Deleter! I can make Pokémon forget their moves.
You're here so I can make your Pokémon forget a move, um-hmm?
Which Pokémon will that be, hmm?
Remember me if there are moves you need to, um, have forgotten!
Um, that Pokémon only knows one move. Hrmmp, I can't make it forget its only move...
Hrmmp? I'm fairly certain that, um, Egg doesn't know any moves.
Which move do you want forgotten, hrmmp?

I'm the Pokémon Move Maniac! I know every move Pokémon can learn by leveling up, and I can teach 'em to your Pokémon! I'm totally into collecting Heart Scales right now, so bring me one and I'll share the maniacal magic of moves!
Oh! Sweet! That's a Heart Scale, right enough! You'd like me to teach your Pokémon a move?
Which Pokémon will it be?
If any of your Pokémon needs to remember a move, bring me a Heart Scale!
Huh? I don't have any moves I can teach Pokémon Eggs.
I'm sorry, but it doesn't look like I've got any moves to teach that Pokémon.
