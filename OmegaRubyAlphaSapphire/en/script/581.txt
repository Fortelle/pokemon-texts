Yo, how's it going, Champ-to-be <var>?
Wattson, the Leader of Mauville Gym, uses Electric-type Pokémon. If you challenge him with Water-type Pokémon, he'll zap them! Bzz-zzzt! And he's put in switch-controlled electric devices all over his Gym! Eccentric!
Hey, go for it!
Whoa, you're electrifying! You've powered the door open!












Oh? Now, what are you doing here?
What? You say you've gotten past all my rigged doors?
Wahahahah! Now, that is amusing!
The plans to reform Mauville are done for now. Making traps for my Gym and battling with young Trainers like you are the things I live for now!
Then I, Wattson, the Leader of Mauville Gym, shall electrify you!

I was electrified by you. Now, take this Badge!
<var> received the Dynamo Badge from Wattson.
With the Dynamo Badge, Pokémon can use the HM Rock Smash outside of battle. One other thing—Pokémon up to Level 40 will obey you now, even if you got 'em from someone else!
All righty then, this here's for you, too! Go on, take it with you!
Volt Switch is a move where your Pokémon attacks the opponent and then rushes back to switch places with a party Pokémon in waiting!
I swell with optimism, seeing a promising young Trainer like you!
Wahahahah! Go forth and endeavor, youngster!

Oh! So you've become the Champion, have you? That's what I expect from a youngster that has my approval! I look forward to more big things from you in the future!
