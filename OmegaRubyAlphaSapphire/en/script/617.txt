Even if a Pokémon is weak now, it will grow stronger if you raise it. The most important thing is love! Love for your Pokémon!
Do you use Repels? They keep Pokémon away, so they're useful when you're in a hurry to get somewhere.
Do you have any Antidotes on you? If a Pokémon is poisoned, it will steadily lose HP when battling. To make matters worse, the poison won't disappear after the battle, either. I recommend you bring some Antidotes when you set out on an adventure!
