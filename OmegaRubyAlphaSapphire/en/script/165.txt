Hm?
<var>? So, we meet again. How has it been? Have you been using the Mega Bracelet wisely? I suppose I needn't even ask, though. Not when it comes to you and your team.

I wonder... Have you noticed? Hm? There's something here you can't see.
Now, if I were to use this device on the invisible obstacle...
No, no... Rather than describing it, I should just show you. That should be more entertaining.
<var>...
<var>...
Are you and your Pokémon ready for battle?
No? I'll wait here, so go get ready.
Good. In that case...
Good. In that case...
I want you to take this.
Try it on. I'm sure it will fit you.
<var> slipped the Devon Scope on.
A previously invisible Pokémon became visible to the naked eye!
The startled Pokémon attacked!
Just as I expected. That's called a Devon Scope. It's a fantastic piece of tech that lets you see Pokémon in hiding.
Consider it a gift from me. Take it.
And one more thing...
This stone ranks as one of my top five favorite stones in existence. I have no doubt that your Pokémon will like it, too.
You know, <var>... I like to see Trainers and Pokémon who are trying their best. That's why I like you so much.

Hm? It seemed as though something just... shone for a moment in your Bag. I'm sure I sensed the power of some kind of stone... A Meteorite...? No, it couldn't be...
Let's meet again someday.
There's an invisible obstacle in your way.
Would you like to use the Devon Scope?

Route 120 ← Fortree City
→　Route 121 ←　Route 120





Ahead waits a natural labyrinth, far more fearsome than this route. I'm afraid I can't let you pass if you're not at least as strong as Fortree's Gym Leader, Winona.
