Grumble... What happened to the others who went to Fallarbor? They're late...
Grumble... I'd like to ride the Cable Car to the top, too..
Grumble... You two never cease to complain... Grumble...
Grumble... What happened to the others who went to Fallarbor? They're late...
Grumble... I'd like to ride the Cable Car to the top, too..
Grumble... Mumble... Rumble... If I have to pick just one, it's GRUMBLE!
Eh, I'd like to get to Mauville, but if I went down these ledges, it'd be no easy matter to get back to Lavaridge.
Mt. Chimney Cable Car A short walk this way! ↑
Mt. Chimney For Lavaridge Town or the summit, please take the Cable Car.
Route 112 ← Lavaridge Town
Ah!
<var>!
Look! Right up there! That's Mt. Chimney!
It sure is big... No, more like huge... It totally takes my breath away! I'd love to take the Cable Car all the way up to the top someday...
Hm? Hey, <var>, don't your Pokémon seem a bit ragged around the edges? Here, let me give them a little boost!
Your team's health was restored!
Here! Take this, too!
I bet you can find all kinds of ways to use it in the mountains that lie ahead! But it won't work outside of battle if you don't have a Badge from Lavaridge Gym.
Gasp! What am I doing nattering away here? I'm supposed to be on my way to Fallarbor to visit Professor Cozmo!
I'm off for now, <var>, but let's battle next time!
Hm?
So it's you, <var>.
You see that mountain up there? That's Mt. Chimney.
I dunno, but... But seeing it for real is, like... Like a punch in the gut, you know? Hope I might get to take the Cable Car up to the top someday...
Hey, <var>, doesn't your team seem a bit worse for wear? Here. I'll help them out for you.
And why don't you take this?
I bet you can find all kinds of ways to use it in the mountains that lie ahead! Oh... But it won't work out here if you don't have a Badge from Lavaridge Gym.
Bah! This is no time to be giving you tricks! I'm supposed to be heading to Fallarbor to visit Professor Cozmo right now!
See you later, <var>. Next time let's have a battle, OK?
