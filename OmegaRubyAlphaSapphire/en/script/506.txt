The Gym Leaders in this city are a formidable duo. Their combination attacks are, like, excellent and wow!
Pokémon that live in the sea and in caves and things are really, really good at hiding. If they catch even a glimpse of you, they'll be gone in an instant! And sometimes you really feel like you can sense a Pokémon around, but you still won't be able to find it unless you can actually see it with your eyes. You have to spot 'em first, and then sneak up slowly! That's the trick!
I'm going to win a whole lot of Link Battles, and me and my Pokémon will charm everyone! We'll have tons of fans all over the world. That's my ultimate goal!
Aha! Pokémon Journal The effects of Secret Power and Nature Power depend on the location. Misty Terrain and Grassy Terrain also change their effects.
