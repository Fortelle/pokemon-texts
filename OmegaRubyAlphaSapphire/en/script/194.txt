I get it, OK?! You're trying to show me how much you like goggles, right?! I get it, OK?!
You can protect yourself from all kinds of stuff with Safety Goggles! Even though these things that I'm wearing look like glasses, they're actually goggles, too!
How did you manage to climb your way up here? Did you use a strange power like me, I wonder? ...You rode a Mach Bike up here? It wasn't some strange power? Do you think I could ride one, too?
I'm in pretty good shape, so maybe I'll try riding one of those Mach Bikes, too.
The sandstorm is vicious. It's impossible to keep going.
<var> put on Go-Goggles!
