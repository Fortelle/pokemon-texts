I'm the owner of the Seashore House. You can call me Mr. Sea! What I love above all is to see hot Pokémon battles.
Let me see if your heart burns hot! If you can defeat all the Trainers here, I'll reward your effort.
Show me some hot matches! I run the Seashore House for that reason alone!
You're scorching hot! Those battles blazed! I'm more than pleased!
As thanks for showing me your hot streak, I want you to take these. It's half a dozen bottles of Soda Pop!

Want to buy some Soda Pop? Pokémon love it! Only $300 a bottle! Try some, buy some!
Here ya go!
You don't have the money.
No? That's too bad.
Ah, I don't think you can carry any more.













It's a machine for making snow cones!
The freezer is stuffed with scrumptious ice cream.
The freezer is stocked with refreshing cold drinks.
The pile of cushions is covered with sand from the beach.
There's an old calendar hanging on the wall.
