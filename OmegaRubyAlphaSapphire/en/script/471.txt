I am the last of the Pokémon League Elite Four, Drake the Dragon master!
In their natural state, Pokémon are wild living things. They are free. At times, they hinder us. At times, they help us.
For us to battle alongside Pokémon as partners, do you know what it takes? Do you know what is needed?
If you don't, you will never prevail over me!

You deserve every credit for coming this far as a Pokémon Trainer. You do seem to know what is needed.
Yes, what a Trainer needs is a true and virtuous heart. It is through their contact with Trainers that Pokémon learn right from wrong. The influence of their Trainers' good hearts helps them grow strong!
Go! Go onward! The Champion is waiting!
Oh, I've been waitin' for you! My Pokémon and I are going to show you everything we've got! Well then, you had better get ready to try and stop me!
I got a glimpse inside your heart! There's nothing for me to say to you! Go forth, Trainer! Go on to your next challenge with your head held high!
