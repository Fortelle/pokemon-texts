I'm not going to take it easy just because you're our Leader's kid. I'll show you how horrible it is for a Pok√©mon to take a critical hit!

Your father really is strong. He's a Trainer worthy of respect. And I sense the same brilliance in you as in your father. I hope you'll stage a terrific battle between father and sondaughter!
The Trainers of Petalburg City have become a lot tougher since your father became Leader.
