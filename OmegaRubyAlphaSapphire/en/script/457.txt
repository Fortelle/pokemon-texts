Wow! You got scouted by THE one and only Lisia?! You're so lucky!
Lissi! Give me your autograph! And I want Ali's footprint, too!
Lisia and Ali are like the idols of the Contest Spectacular circuit! Everybody looks up to them!
Lissi and Ali's performance up on stage is amazing! They're unbeatable!
Ah! You there! Could you spare a moment?
The portrait here upon this wall... It is of your Pokémon, who just managed to win its way through the Master Rank, is it not? Splendid!
You see, I am the curator of the Lilycove Museum. This portrait of your Pokémon... Such life... Such vitality... I would love to have such a masterpiece in our museum's collection as well. Please come visit us to view it in the museum proper. I look forward to seeing your continued contest success!
