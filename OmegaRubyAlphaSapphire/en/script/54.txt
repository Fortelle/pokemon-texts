Yo, how's it going, Champ-to-be <var>?
Dewford's Gym Leader, Brawly, commands Fighting-type Pokémon.
Going against him with Normal-type Pokémon is asking for trouble. Fighting-type Pokémon will lay a serious smackdown on Normal-type Pokémon, so stay on your toes!
Hey, OK, go for it!
Whoa! It's turned too bright in here! Your future is bright, too!









I'm Brawly! Dewford's Gym Leader!
I've been churned in the rough waves of these parts...
And I've grown tough using the cave at the outskirts of this town as my training ground, as well as using the equipment in this Gym.
So you want to challenge me?
Let me see what you're made of!

OK, you've got me. Take this Gym Badge!
<var> received the Knuckle Badge from Brawly.
The Knuckle Badge makes all Pokémon up to Level 30, even those you get in trades, obey without question.
Hmm... You know what? I think you can make full use of this, too.
I'm sure this will help your Pokémon bulk up muscle!
Bulk Up temporarily enhances the Pokémon's muscle power. The move boosts both Attack and Defense stats of the Pokémon.
I can see your talent becoming a giant wave that causes a storm of astonishment with Trainers one day! I look forward to the day when I can surf your giant wave!
By the way, have you been to Granite Cave? It's located to the north of this town. It's full of fascinating stuff, like rare stones and wall paintings thousands of years old. My friend Steven rushed to the cave after I told him about it.

You defeated Steven, right? The wave of rumor hit this town, too! I didn't think you'd roll in to the Hoenn region so soon. I've got catching up to do! My Pokémon and I are working hard every day to bulk up!
