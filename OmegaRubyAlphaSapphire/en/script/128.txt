Would you like to trade Poké Miles for prizes?
PokéMileage is the service that allows you to collect miles when you trade Pokémon. The number of miles you can earn depends on the distance between regions registered on the two Nintendo 3DS systems. You can also collect a small number of miles by walking around the Hoenn region. To view your current miles, please check Poké Miles on your Trainer Card.
Collect Poké Miles and come again.
