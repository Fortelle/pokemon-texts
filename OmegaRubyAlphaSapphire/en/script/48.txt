The Sturdy Ability protects Pokémon from one-hit KO moves like Fissure! But that's not all! It also protects the Pokémon when a normal attack was strong enough to have made it faint in one blow. I want to acquire that kind of raging strength of my own as a single man!
On Mt. Chimney's peak, there's a local specialty that you can buy only there. Give one to a Pokémon—it will be elated.
