What? Are you coming? Come and get some, then!
Pi pikwee!
Grah, keelhaul it all! This hostage Pokémon turned out to be worthless! And to think I made a getaway... into this tunnel to nowhere! And you! Now you're here to battle me. Really?

This is plain not right... The boss told me this would be a slick-and-easy job to pull. All I had to do was steal some parts from Devon. Tch! You want 'em back that badly, then take 'em!
Peeko! Am I glad to see you're safe!
My Peeko owes her life an' freedom to you, ladss! They call me Mr. Briney. And you are?
Ah, so it's <var>, is it now! Then I sincerely thank you, <var>! If there's ever a thing I can do to help you in turn, don't you hesitate to tell me. If I'm to be found, it will always be at my cottage by the sea near Petalburg Woods.
Come, Peeko! High time we're under way to home!
Pikwee!
... Why can't I keep digging? Is the boulder too hard? My beloved girlfriend lives in Verdanturf Town, just beyond here... If Rustboro and Verdanturf were joined by this tunnel, I could visit her every day... But this... What am I to do?
To get from Rustboro to Verdanturf, you need to go to Dewford, then pass through Slateport and Mauville...
Wow! You shattered those boulders blocking the way. To show you how much I appreciate it, I'd like you to have this!
I found that when I was digging for the tunnel. I felt like there's some mysterious power coming from it, but I don't think I could do a thing with it.
Wanda! Now I can see you anytime!
That's...that's wonderful! Come on. Let me take you to my place so you can rest.
On the other side of this rock... My boyfriend labors day after day. He...he's not just digging this tunnel to come see me. He works his hands raw and rough for the benefit of everyone.



I want to do something about this boulder, but... It's beyond me to deal with it alone.

It's a cracked boulder. A Pokémon may be able to break it.
Y-your Pokémon! It can use Rock Smash?! Please, kid! Use Rock Smash and break up these boulders!
Th-thank you so much!
Oh... I s-see...
If only we had a Pokémon that could use Rock Smash. If we asked it, it could break up these boulders in no time flat!

Thank you so much for doing this!
Oh... OK... That's disappointing. But it's up to you...
