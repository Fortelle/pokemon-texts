PROJECT AZOTH File No. 1 The goal of Project AZOTH is to return the world— return everything—to the beginning. In order to further the project, we must proceed with research on Groudon's Primal Reversion. Primal Reversion is a potential of Pokémon Evolution, a potential different from Mega Evolution. Mega Evolution is made possible by the energy of people and Pokémon. Primal Reversion is made possible by natural energy. In Primal Reversion, Groudon absorbs natural energy into its body, thereby increasing its power dramatically. Both states significantly enhance Pokémon's power: the difference lies in the source of the required energy.

Sniff, sniff... Today's smell check of our beds is done! They're fine. They smell good.
HOT! The magma flowing in this tube is super hot! I know better than to touch things that I know are hot.
Hey, you—no, no, no. This is Team Magma's library, where documents on our highly confidential plan are stored. No outsiders are allowed to enter.
The Project AZOTH... A stands for the beginning, Z stands for the end—that's what I think, but I don't know what O, T, and H stand for.
All of us gather and listen to our leader Maxie's edifying speech at 11 o'clock every morning. Every morning. EVERY morning...
There's a bed. Let's take a rest.
