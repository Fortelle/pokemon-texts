<var>... Pokémon hide in tall grass like this, don't they?
P-please stay there to watch and see if I can catch one properly.
Wh-whoa!
I did it... It's my... My own Pokémon!
Thanks so much, <var>! Let's head back to the Gym!
I'm...not very tall, so I sink right into tall grass. The grass goes up my nose and... Fwafwafwafwafwa... Fwatchoo!


I'm going to catch a whole bunch of Pokémon!
Route 102 → Oldale Town
Route 102 ← Petalburg City














Heeeeeey!
How's it going, <var>? Have you been using your DexNav and perfecting your sneaking skills? I hope you already checked out the DexNav's Detector Mode. It reacts to Pokémon in the area, so it's really handy!
Ah!
Look! Up there! Check 'em out, <var>!
Those were...Beautifly, weren't they? I'll have to check in my DexNav later to be sure!
But, wow, we already made it through Route 102, huh? I guess it's really true that time flies when you're with a friend!
Oh, l-look! There's Petalburg already!
<var>, your dad... He's the Gym Leader in Petalburg City, isn't he?
Maybe I should try to take him on myself, once I train up my Pokémon a bit more!
Guess I'm off then, <var>! Let's meet up again sometime!













Hey! There you are!
How's it going, <var>? Hope you've been using your DexNav and perfecting your sneaking skills. Oh, and you DO know about your DexNav's Detector Mode, right? It'll react to any Pokémon in the area, so it's pretty handy to use!
Hm?
Whoa! Check 'em out, <var>!
It's like...I don't know... Seeing them like that makes me feel kinda...warm. You know?
All right then!
We're nearly there! Petalburg, here we come!
Norman is the Gym Leader in this city, right? And...your dad, <var>.
I'm thinking maybe I should challenge him once I train up my Pokémon a bit more.
Guess I'll be off then!
