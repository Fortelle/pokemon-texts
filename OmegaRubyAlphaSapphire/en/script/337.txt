It's a model of a large sailing vessel! There is not a single mote of dust on top of the model.
It's a showcase! There is a lock on it, so you can't open it.
It's the Team Magma flag!

Uwaahhh!
This conversation isn't proceeding as expected!
Ugh...
If it has come to this, then I, Tabitha, shall handle this myself!
Courtney!
Y-yes?!
Apologize to Leader Maxie!
Hu-huh?! Ow...ch...
Hurry up! OK?! Just say, "Sorry!"
I'm sorry! Leader Maxie, I'm sorry! I won't do it...anymore! I'll never do anything...like that...again!
So please... Forgive... Forgive me.
?!
Wah...wah... Sniffle...
What are you—?!
Sniff...sniffle... Ohh...ooh...
... ... Fine.
I understand.
Courtney. I, the great Maxie, will forgive you.
But only on one condition!
Huh?!
?
You must...also forgive me.
Courtney. I never imagined... I never could have imagined...
How very loyal you were to me. Nor did I imagine even one iota of the shock you must have experienced, due to my recent speech and conduct, or how it could have pained you. The one who drove you to such an extreme act was me. I am truly sorry for that.
You see, Courtney, I would like to start on a new path. There are truths that I have learned because of the mistakes I have made. They pit me against others who are not like me and against ideas that differ from mine. They tell me the importance of understanding these others, even though we may continue to cause pain to one another. And that holds true whether the opponent I face is human, Pokémon, or even the might of nature itself. I will take this step forward, free from hesitation, and meet my foe. And together we will find a way to create, not destroy. Or so I hope. That is the vision that I, Maxie, have for Team Magma's future.
Will you come with me on this journey as well? Courtney.
Wahh... Uwahh... Waahhh! Waahhh... Of course I will!
My... You certainly do cry a lot.
Ahyahya! And that settles that! Ahyahyahyahya!
Guh—?!
All right! And the winner is Zinnia!
Leader Maxie! Please compose yourself!
Grr...
The great Maxie has fallen to this woman?!
Murrr!♪ Murrr!♪
Oh, oh, what's this? Aren't you a happy girl, Aster? ♪
Just what I'd expect of my daughter! We're so in sync! Ahahaha!
Woman... Who are you?
Who am I? That's a surprisingly difficult question.
... I couldn't become who I was supposed to be, so who does that make me now? ...
Haha! Whatever, right? Enough with the introspection and the soul searching...
You there! <var>! Don't just stand there like a stick in the mud. Come on over and say hi.
Could it be?! The child?!
You... Why are you here?
Isn't it obvious? He's the hero, right? Here to save the world again.
Isn't it obvious? She's the heroine, right? Here to save the world again.
Oops. But looks like she's a bit too late this time. If only you'd been here just one minute earlier!
Zinnia snatched the Key Stone away from Maxie!
You—?!
Le-leader?!
All right. I'd say this Key Stone is mine.
We finally got everything, Aster.
Murrr?
Now we can do it: The summoning.
We will summon Rayquaza!
Well then, looks like my job here is done. So don't mind me while I excuse myself.
Oh. <var>?
I really hope you'll come chasing after me, you know? We'll be heading to that ancient tower, sealed since primal times, the Sky Pillar.
If you don't know what that is, well, ask that former Champ of yours. He'll know what I'm talking about.
See you there!
Murrr!
Wh-wh-wh-wh— What is going on here?! Who does she think she is, messing up our base and then giving us the slip?! That can never be forgiven!
...
Now I see...
Yes, it was not chance that brought you here now. This was inevitable.
Leader?
Tabitha. Give it to him.
Tabitha. Give it to her.
What did you say?! I-is that all right?!
Yes... Now that the Key Stone has been stolen, a Mega Stone will serve me no purpose.
Acknowledged.
Cameruptite. Make sure your Camerupt holds on to it tightly.
I do not have the power now to use Mega Evolution. So I entrust it to you. I entrust it believing that this is the best action I can now take!
That woman... She had such utter mastery over her Dragon-type Pokémon. There is more to her than meets the eye.
I do not know what must be going through her mind. But...I think you may be the only one who can now stand against her. So I ask you this favor: Rage! Take up this fight for me, and bring this crisis to its resolution!
The Entry Call (Ver. 0.09) app rang on your PokéNav Plus!
Steven: <var>! Are you all right?!
Steven: <var>! Are you all right?!
Steven: ... Steven: Is that right... I never even imagined... Steven: The Key Stone... The Sky Pillar... And the Draconid people... Steven: So that's it... I begin to see the line connecting these dots. Steven: I think we need to meet up at once to discuss what we should do next. Steven: I'll be waiting at the Space Center. Up on 2F. Steven: Do hurry.
...Kzt!
That woman... She said that the former Champion would know what she was about. I assume you of all people should know where to find him, but...?
Please, do get her for our dear Leader, Maxie!
Child. Ah... Forgive me. I should greet you properly by now, <var>.
Child. Ah... Forgive me. I should greet you properly by now, <var>.
Feel free to spend one hour, or even a day, in our hideout. We will always welcome a visit from you, <var>.

Ahyahya! Listen up, child! Chief Admin will be the title that I, Tabitha, am referred to by in our newly reborn Team Magma! I've successfully made my way past being just any old Admin! Ahyahya! Capable people are quick to succeed! Ahya! Ahyahyahyahya!
Welcome. Glad to see you looking well.
