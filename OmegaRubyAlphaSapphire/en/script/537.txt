By being together with Pokémon, people make more and more friends. And that brings the world closer together. I think it's wonderful!
There! Go, bird Pokémon!
Heheh, I asked my Wingull to run an errand for me.
Good! Welcome back, Wingull!
Huh? What is this? What is it holding?
A Mental Herb? It must have picked it up somewhere.
But I'm not a Trainer, so you can have it.
Thanks to my Wingull, I'm able to be close to my friend who lives far away.
Kweee!
