"I Really Did It! A Star Is Born!"
That's what I'm calling it!
<var>! You've gotta keep up this pace and just go as far as you can go! Become a real contest star! If you could have as much fun with Contest Spectaculars as me, I'd be happy as Slugma on a sunny day!

You could become a massive star! I've got a good feeling about you!

I want to battle you!
Why do you do contests?
Nothing, really.
What? A battle? Oooh... Truth is, I'm not all that hot at battles... But don't you worry! Maybe I'll get to take you on in a contest someday!
I started in contests because I wanted to show people that there's this whole other amazing side to Pokémon, more than what you see in battles or whatever. Pokémon are about more than strength. You can raise 'em to be beautiful, or you can raise 'em to be tough as nails. They grow and change, trying as hard as they can to live up to their Trainer's feelings.
Ali! Altari!♪
I want the whole world to get it about all the other cool aspects of raising Pokémon! That's why Ali and I set out to become stars! When you're a star, and everyone starts following you, then they naturally start wanting to know more about contests, too. Am I right?
See, that's why I started thinking that a Trainer shouldn't just depend on Pokémon. The Trainer's gotta be just as cute, or just as cool, to stand alongside their awesome Pokémon!
Oopsies! Sorry again! I probably went on too much...
You gotta win again next time, OK?
Liii?
Ali-liii!
