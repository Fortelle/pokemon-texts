Let's see... On Route 103, I found this Pokémon... and this one...and this one, too...
Oh! Hey, <var>!
What's that? Oh! My dad gave you a Pokémon as a gift, huh?
Well then, why don't we go ahead and have a quick battle? I'll give you a taste of what being a Trainer is really like!


Wow... I think I know why my dad has his eye on you now. I mean, you just got that Pokémon, and you've already got that strong of a bond.
I bet you could probably befriend any kind of Pokémon you meet!
Phew... I guess I'd better head back to the lab!
OK, so it's this one and that one that live on Route 103...
Huh? Hey, <var>!
Ohhh. So you finally got a Pokémon from my dad? Then how about a little battle? Since we're here and all!
I'm going to teach you what being a Trainer's all about!

I think I know why my dad had his eye on you now.
Look, you just got your Pokémon, right? And you already have that strong of a bond? I get the feeling that you could befriend any Pokémon, <var>. No doubt.
Well, I've got some good data here, so I guess it's time I got back to the lab. You should head back, too, <var>!
"Press the Circle Pad slowly to sneak close to Pokémon." "Pokémon are less likely to find you while you're sneaking up on them." The book Professor Birch wrote— "The Fieldwork 101" said so!





If only my Pokémon could use Surf, too, I could get to Mauville City in no time at all.
If you cross the sea from here, it'll be a shortcut to Oldale Town. Fufufu, that's useful, isn't it?

It was a good battle. Thanks! Let me heal up both our parties real quick.
