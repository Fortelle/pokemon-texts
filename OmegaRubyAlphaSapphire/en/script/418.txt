Oh! I knew you'd come!
You're the first punk ever to sneak into this hideout and make it this far! I expected nothing less from a crumb like you!
But I've got some bad news for you! We already completely finished upgrading the ship!
Look at that drill! As long as we've got that thing, we could KO the seal over the Seafloor Cavern with one punch!
My bro Archie's in the ship! Come at me! If you take me out fast, you might be able to catch up to him!
Before you do, though... We need to settle once and for all who's stronger, you and your sorry Pokémon, or me and my not-so-sorry Pokémon!
...Hoo! ...Haaahh!
I'm... Heating up!
Hooah! Full on! I'm burning up!
Me! You! Pokémon! Mixing it up! Dueling!
Well! Welll! Wellllll! Let's battle it out until we've got nothing left!
Hah... Hah... Hah...
Bro! It's all...on you...now...
...
While we were battling it out...
My bro Archie finished getting ready...
...
I have only one hope...
For my bro Archie to finish doing what he set out to do... That's all...
My bro Archie is everything to me... I live to serve my bro...
...All right, then. You took me out, so I'll give you an idea of what the world will be like if my bro has his way.
My bro Archie is headed for the big blue sea that stretches out from Lilycove City. Deep beneath the surface is the Seafloor Cavern. That's where the world my bro hopes to create... Where the beginnings of the primordial world will be felt...
Regular people and Pokémon can't make it there, though. How could you get there...
Why don't you look around in towns by the sea and use your own thick head to think about it?
They're blueprints that read, "Proposed Alterations to Submarine Explorer 1."
Instructions on how to use the panel that controls the locks are written here.
Teeheehee!
We finally meet again.
Hm? Ah... Is this the first time we've met?
Nincompoop! It doesn't matter!
Brace yourself! We'll show you the power of quintuplets!
Hah, hah, hah...
We lost...
It's odd. I can't believe five of us couldn't defeat just one Trainer. Did you cheat? Grumble, grumble...
Nincompoop! Stop whining!
Our leaders are ahead! You have no chance to defeat them!
Our leader's room isn't here. You're the second person to make this mistake. There was also a girl with a Whismur.
The girl who came here asking where our leader's room was... I heard she was an intruder. I probably shouldn't have told her where it was. Archie will give me noogies...
