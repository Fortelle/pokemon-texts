I want to raise a Pokémon that's the strongest and the best for both battles and any Contest Spectacular. It's vexing, trying to figure out which moves I should make it learn.



You can take a picture of Pokémon during a Contest Spectacular. And you can upload the photo to the Pokémon Global Link using Game Sync. I'm gonna brag about my Pokémon globally!
Hey, man, I'm like majorly cheesed, you know. Like, you know, I just wanted to know why my Pokémon never won, you know, like, hey? So, like, I gave the Judge my two cents, you know. They're free. And he wouldn't hear me out, like, hey! So, like, total buzzkill, man! Hey, like, you! Zip it, you know? Just, you know, take this!
That's, like, Torment, you know? Hey, you hearing me? Like, it won't let the other guy use the same move twice in a row, see? Hey, now, you listen here. Like, I'm not laying a torment on you!
It's a big machine with a speed indicator and a meter.
