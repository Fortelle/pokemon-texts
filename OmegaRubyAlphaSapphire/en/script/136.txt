Hullo, hullo, and welcome. I hope you meet lots of Pokémon!
As you explore, you may see some litter here and there. Sometimes you can spot Poké Balls that have been lying around for years. No one has ever come to claim them, and we'd collect them for recycling anyway, so feel free to pick them for your own use.
