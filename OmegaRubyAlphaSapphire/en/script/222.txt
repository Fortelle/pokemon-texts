Wassup! I like to shout my lungs out! It feels so good! You can have this, so you try it out! Use it on a Pokémon, and it will learn a move that attacks with its voice. If the move is used several times in a row, it becomes more powerful!
A word of advice! A TM, or Technical Machine, can be used many times. It won't go away. So try it out as many times as you want!
This flower shop started selling potted plants recently. It made me so happy, I went overboard shopping. I don't need this White Herb anymore. Would you take it, please?

If you see Berries growing in soft soil, feel free to take them. But make sure you plant a Berry in the same spot. That's common courtesy. Here, I'll share this with you.
The way you look, you must be a Trainer, no? Trainers often make Pokémon hold Berries. It's up to you whether to grow Berries or use them.

Trainer Tips There are pairs of Trainers who challenge others for two-on-two Pokémon battles called Double Battles. In a Double Battle, the Trainer must send out two Pokémon, the ones at the top left and the top right of their list. Pay attention to how you array the Pokémon in your list!
