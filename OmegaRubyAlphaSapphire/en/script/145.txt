So, you've come, <var>.
So, you've come, <var>.
As you can see, I have undone the seal on the entrance to the Sky Pillar. Follow the path within, and you will reach the pillar in time.
However... To go beyond this point... There is one more trial you must overcome.
This is my duty as one of the ancient Sootopolitans, a duty passed down to me by my former master.
You must battle me. Here and now. Prove to me that your power is great enough to face what lies ahead!
Now tell me... Are you prepared?
I see. I will wait. Prepare yourself.
Then let us begin... Champion of Hoenn. You, who should exhibit the most graceful of art in battle with your Pokémon... I would have you show me your true strength!
As I have come to expect from you, <var>... You are an excellent Pokémon Trainer.
As I have come to expect from you, <var>... You are an excellent Pokémon Trainer.
The Pokémon that you sent out in that battle... At times dancing as lightly as an elusive spring breeze... Yet striking with the sudden surety of lightning from the blue. Watching you command the battle with such ease and grace... Even I might succumb to your charm.
Now go forth. Find the truth that you seek.
As one of the ancient people of Sootopolis, I cannot intrude upon this holy place. I will return to Sootopolis for now and try to lay plans in case the worst should come to pass despite all our efforts. I'm sorry that we always seem to be leaving the fate of all the world in your hands. Yet there it lies once again. Good luck to you, young Champion!
