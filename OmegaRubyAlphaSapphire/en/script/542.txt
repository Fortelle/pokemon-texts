Yo, how's it going, Champ-to-be <var>?
Fortree Gym Leader Winona is a master of Flying-type Pokémon. She's waiting at the back of this Gym, behind the rotating doors. She's waiting for new challengers who are trying to take wing!
OK, go for it!
You did it! You've achieved liftoff!












I am Winona. I am the Leader of the Fortree Pokémon Gym.
I have become one with bird Pokémon and have soared the skies...
However grueling the battle, we will triumph with grace...
Witness the elegant choreography of my bird Pokémon and me!

I recognize your talent and present you with this Gym Badge.
<var> received the Feather Badge from Winona.
With the Feather Badge, all Pokémon up to Lv. 70, even those received through trades, will obey your every command. You will also be able to use the HM move Fly outside of battle.
And this... This is a gift from me.
Roost... With this move, the user can restore its HP by up to half of its max HP by landing on the ground and resting its injured body. However, the user loses its Flying-type designation during the turn, so be cautious.
You won against me... I know you'll keep aiming higher and higher! Someday, you may even fly up into the sky... That's the impression I get from you.

You became the Champion, a little bird told me. I know you'll keep aiming higher and higher! You'll zip around the land, the sea, and the vastness of the sky... That's the impression I get from you.
