Oh! So you did come to visit! If you're looking for Wally, though, I'm afraid he's gone. After he lost to you in Mauville, he said he had to train more, and we haven't seen him since. It must be his Pokémon that have lit such a fire in that boy and given him so much hope to live for...
Wally... I hope you're all right out there...
Is that right? Wally made it all that way on his own... He may be my little brother's boy, but I feel as proud as I would if he was mine!
Oh! You're the <var> who Wally was telling me about. I'm Wally's cousin, Wanda!
Don't you worry about Wally. He'll be just fine, I'm sure. I know my little cousin, and he has his Pokémon with him, too!
Thanks to you, I can see my girlfriend every day. Happy? You bet I am!
My daughter's boyfriend is a very driven and passionate sort of person. He's been digging a tunnel nonstop just so he can see my daughter. My daughter's a little concerned, so she goes out to the tunnel a lot.
It's amazing. My daughter's boyfriend was digging the tunnel by hand! It's so incredible!
If anything were to happen to Wally, I would never be able to look his parents in Petalburg in the eyes...
Wally was in Ever Grande? His parents in Petalburg would be astonished to hear that!
Why, it feels like it's been ages since we saw you last!
What wonderful timing! I was thinking that I wanted to give this to you...
I didn't really thank you properly when you helped smash those rocks in the tunnel.
Do you remember how light came falling out of the sky a while ago? I found this in the yard that day. Actually, I found two, and I gave the other to Wally. It's a pretty stone, and I'm sure your Pokémon would be delighted if you let one of them hold it!
