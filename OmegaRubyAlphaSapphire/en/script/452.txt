Ahem... Aaah, aah, aah. ♪ There's no jamming my feelings for you. ♪ I'll show you the appeal of my love. ♪
Oh! <var>! I was just sneaking in a little rehearsal! I want to shine as an idol, so when I have free time, I get some practice in! But I was forgetting something more important!

You've finally made it! You've won a Hyper Rank contest! Wow! Fantastic! You're totally on fire, <var>!

"You Can Always Count on Me! The Glittering Life of an Idol!"
That's what I'll call this chapter! Don't you think that's perfect, Ali?
Li! Ali-trrriii!
Oooh! I almost forgot to tell you!
I'm sure you'll blast right through the next rank, too, <var>! The other contestants will be tough... It's Master Rank, you know! You've gotta give your Pokémon plenty of Pokéblocks so their condition is just perfect, and think of the perfect set of moves to use together! But I'm not worried! I know you can do it, <var>!

And, um... If you... When you... If you win all the contests up through Master Rank... Then what would you think about you and me maybe—
Heeey! Lisia! I know you've been pining away for me, but Chaz is on the scene at last!
Mach, mach!
Oh. Chaz. And Macherie.
I don't think anyone would say I've been "pining"... And could you have picked a worse time to interrupt?
What could I be interrupting? Nothing worth anything is going on till I'm here! I'm your MVP! Never mind that anyway. Look, Macherie brought lunch again today, so come and join me for a nice, private—
Mah!
Macherie! Cherie! ♪
Aa...ali...
Maaach! ♪ Maaach! ♪
Hahaha! Macherie, you scamp! You've got a crush a mile wide on Ali! See? Even our Pokémon have good chemistry! We're a perfect pair! It's written in the stars. Destined to be... the ultimate rivals...Chaz and Lisia!
And YOU! Here you are again, trying to steal my spot as rival. Getting in our way! So you happened to win Hyper Rank, and you're not as hopeless as I figured. Sure it's pretty impressive, and I... I should congratulate you on it... But still! Don't dream you're ever gonna beat ME!
Chaz! Look, the contest has brought us all together, which is pretty lucky for us. Can you just drop all this talk of winning and losing? Make the most of being here and doing our best! Am I right? Right! Let's all have fun!
<var>, you want to talk?
<var>, you want to talk?
What were you going to say before?
What's up with Macherie?
No, not right now.
Ah! Um...well... How about I tell you after you win all five Master Rank contests, <var>? See, I...um... Tee hee! Nothing! Never mind! You'll have to win to find out!

Oh, Macherie? Well, Chaz says they met on a dark and rainy night. Macherie was a Machop back then, and someone had just left her there in a box... That's the box that she always carries around with her, you see? I guess it's her fond memento of the moment she and Chaz first met.
Yeah? I'm glad we get the chance to chat after contests, though.
Humph. Well, if you're going to keep going in the contest world, you'd better do your best on stage so you don't embarrass Lisia. She did scout you, after all!
Maaachan! (Macherie seems to be very happy...)
Teep!
