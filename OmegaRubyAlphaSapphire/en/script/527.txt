Hoo, boy... Master Rank contests, here I come. The world will know that my dearest Pokémon is the cutest being in all existence. The time has come! Uheheheh.
You can see a whole variety of Pokémon here. That's why I make this place a regular part of my daily stroll.


The Toughness Contest is like extreme, man! Those muscular appeals... Cascading sweat... I swoon!
Day in and day out, I lavished my care on this Pokémon. Its condition is peaking. Today, victory is mine!
I got a present from a girl who said she was my fan! Hmmm, I've never gotten a present from a girl before. To be honest, it made me really happy!
It's a big machine with a speed indicator and a meter.
