You're the first Trainer I've seen deploy Pokémon with such mastery. But I should warn you—my son is stronger than you. He even challenged the Pokémon League, I'll have you know!
Our family uses this Macho Brace to strengthen our Pokémon more effectively during their training. You may not need it, considering that you beat the whole lot of us, but I hope you'll accept it anyway!
When it comes to Pokémon battles, we're pretty passionate!
Mom is stronger than Dad. I'm stronger than Mom. And Grandma's stronger than me! But my big brother is even stronger than Grandma is!
There's no question that you're strong. But if you ever battle my grandson, you'll end up crying in frustration. He's stronger than any other Trainer we know!
My grandson must be challenging the Pokémon League Champion by now. Knowing my grandson, he could be the Champion already! Ee-hee-hee-hee-hee!
