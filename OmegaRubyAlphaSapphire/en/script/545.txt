That determined expression... That limber way you move... And your well-trained Pokémon... You're obviously a skilled Trainer! No, wait, don't say a word. I can tell just by looking at you. I'm sure that you will be capable of putting this HM to good use. No need to be modest or shy. Go on, take it!
Any Pokémon that's learned Cut can chop down prickly trees if the Trainer has earned the Stone Badge. HMs like this can be used outside of battle, too, with the right Badges!
My dad helped make Rustboro City what it is today. He had his Pokémon use Cut to clear the land of trees and expand the city.
