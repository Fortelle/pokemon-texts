Welcome. My name is Glacia of the Elite Four. I've traveled from afar to Hoenn so that I may hone my Ice-type moves.
But all I have seen are challenges by weak Trainers and their Pokémon.
I wonder what you will show me.
What a relief it would be if I could, for once, have a serious battle against an opponent!

You and your Pokémon... How fiercely your spirits burn! My icy moves pale in the face of such all-consuming flames.
Advance to the next room. There you will learn how fearsome the Pokémon League can truly be!
I've been waiting for a Trainer with a burning-hot soul. How can you oppose Mega Evolution that can freeze everything?
Hmmph... Do you intend to thaw my very heart? That actually wouldn't bother me. Anyway, continue onward! Drake is waiting for you as well.
