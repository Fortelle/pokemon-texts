Hello! I take it you're a traveler. What do you say to taking on our family of four in a series of Pokémon battles?
Is that so? Stop by again if you change your mind!
That's the spirit! I like you!

Hey, all! I've found a pretty strong Trainer!
My goodness! Aren't you young? You must be quite the Trainer to beat my husband, though. Now I suppose it's my turn to battle!

We've got a strong Trainer here! This one's really strong!
You're stronger than Mom? Wow! But I'm strong, too! Really! Honestly!

This stinks... Snivel... Grandmaaa!
How dare you make my precious granddaughter cry! I see I need to teach you a lesson. Prepare to feel the sting of defeat!

If you're not in any hurry, visit with us awhile.
If you don't raise your Pokémon some more, it may be tough to keep winning through the ranks. I've heard the Pokémon League's Elite Four are far stronger than any Gym Leader.
I challenged the Winstrate family, but four matches in a row is tough going... They destroyed me.

Trainer Tips One indicator of a Pokémon's potential power is its Sp. Atk stat. Sp. Atk stands for Special Attack. It affects the strength of special moves. Likewise, the Sp. Def or Special Defense stat protects against special moves!
