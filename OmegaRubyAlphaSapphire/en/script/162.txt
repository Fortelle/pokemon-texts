Hello, and welcome to the Safari Zone! Admittance is free! Catch all the Pokémon you can! Enjoy yourself with Pokémon for as long as time allows!
I met this little rascal here, and now we're just like family!
Guhbeh!
Are you going to the Safari Zone? Then you'd better take either an Acro Bike or a Mach Bike!
There's a book called "The Path of the Safari Zone." It looks long, but do you want to read it?
Chapter One: Foundation. "A desire to provide the children of the Hoenn region with a chance to encounter many Pokémon welled up inside of me and led to my decision to open here." Chapter Two: Opening. "From the very day we opened, a long line wound its way from the Safari Zone. It was a huge success. A desire to make more money off of it welled up inside of me and led to my decision to raise the price of admission."
Chapter Three: Bankruptcy. "As a result of the higher admission prices, customers stopped coming to the Safari Zone. A desire to save my own hide welled up inside of me and led to my decision to flee under cover of night." Chapter Four: Rebirth. "After I had made my escape, the Safari Zone was reborn thanks to the support of some thoughtful people. A desire to pretend that I had never run away welled up inside of me and led to my decision to return to Hoenn." Final Chapter: The Future. "Having made my return, I began working as a volunteer at the Safari Zone. A desire to express my happiness at having returned welled up inside of me and led to my decision to continue to take good care of Pokémon every day."
That look in your eyes... And the aura floating about you... You're one of my kind, aren't you? You make all kinds of mischief, right? If so, you'll really like this!
Maybe it's 'cause I was so naughty in the past, but lately I don't feel refreshed when I wake up. Then I taught this to my Pokémon, and now all my bad dreams get eaten up!
