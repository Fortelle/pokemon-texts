Revives are fantastic! Give one to a Pokémon that's fainted, and that Pokémon will be revived. But be careful. Revive won't restore any PP that has been used up by its moves.
Max Repel can keep weak Pokémon away. And it lasts the longest of all the Repel sprays!
Net Balls and Dive Balls used to be Mossdeep's specialties. A Net Ball is effective against Bug-type and Water-type Pokémon. A Dive Ball works best on Pokémon at the bottom of the sea.
Hey, you! Quick question! Do you want a TM?
I see. If you want to get it, let me know.
That's the TM that my sweetie gave me when I proposed. But I'm not a Trainer, so I don't know how to use TMs. Hahaha!
I want to marry my sweetie and become a happy couple...
