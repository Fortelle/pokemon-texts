Oh, my, my! Are you traveling alone? But you're so young! Good for you! I'm sure my kids could learn a thing or two from you! Me? I'm a Pokéblock Master. If I get just a little serious, why, I can concoct great Pokéblocks. Would you like to learn from me, a Pokéblock Master?
Oh? Are you sure? You shouldn't always try to do everything by yourself, dear!
Oh, good! You're a smart soul! This is a bit long, so listen up! Are you ready? If you want to make great Pokéblocks, you should choose Berries with the same color, if possible. Don't forget that! A good Pokéblock improves the condition of your Pokémon a lot, so it's very useful. And this is also important. If you blend rare Berries with the same color, it's more likely that you'll get great Pokéblocks. And another thing. There are rare Pokéblocks called Rainbow Pokéblocks. You have to make these with all different-colored Berries. It's hard to make them, but they improve all conditions at once, so if you like that, it's worth making them. That's about all you need to know to make good Pokéblocks. If everyone had Pokémon they love, Berries, Pokéblocks, and a loving family, the world would be a happier place. Don't give up, dear!
When my wife gave birth to quadruplets, you bet I was shocked. But, now, seeing them play together, it makes me happy.
I like Pokéblocks, but I prefer giving Poké Puffs to my Pokémon.
I heard that sometimes awesome Pokéblocks can be made!
Before the contest, I'm going to give Pokéblocks to my Pokémon.
I want to brag about how tough my Pokémon is, so we're going to enter a contest together.
