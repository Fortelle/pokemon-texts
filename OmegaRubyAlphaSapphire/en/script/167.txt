I heard that somewhere there's a cave called the Cave of Origin. They say that the spirits of Pokémon are revived there. Could something like that really happen?
Peee-hyoh?
Look at you! You must be tired. Why don't you and your Pokémon take a rest here?
Look at you! You and your Pokémon so full of energy and all!
Look at you! I can tell you've recovered fully! What are you waiting for? Go on with your Pokémon!
