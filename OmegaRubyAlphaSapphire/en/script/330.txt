... Looks like I won't be needing THIS... Hiyyup!
Phew! That's sooo much better! Ooooh, I feel so free! That uniform got pretty stinky after a while! And all sweaty, too!
Murrrm!
Ohhh, my adorable little Aster! ♪ Are you that happy to see me looking like myself again, hmm? ♪ Ahhh, you're just too darned cute! Like always!
Phew.
But there's not much time left for us. It'll only be a matter of weeks... ...No. Days.
Things have gotten a bit tricky now, since that kid managed to stop one of the super-ancient Pokémon from being revived like it should've been.
Not that it's a really big deal. I've already thought of a new plan. If I just tweak a bit with a Key Stone, one with plenty of THAT built up...
Whisss...
I swear I'll protect you. ...Aster.
...
See that, Aster? You always wanted to watch them, right? The Litleonids. A million glittering stars falling from the sky... The show is about to start.
Mur! Murrr!
Aren't we happy now? Yes, what could be better, dear Aster? Ha ha...
... Welcome to the Dragonhark altar. <var>. You know what I am trying to do here by now, don't you?
Ever since I was a little girl, I have always turned my eyes up to the sky. When I was so full of uncertainty that I felt my heart might be crushed by it... When I was so grief-stricken and alone I thought my heart might break of it...
What about you? Have you ever had to do something like that?
I have.
Never.
Right...
Ahaha! You're just too honest! Don't you know that you're supposed to agree, and then we'd share a touching moment of pain?
... I used to watch the stars like this all the time... Together with Aster. We were always together. In good times and in bad.
But I still lost her.
... Hahaha... ... I want to see her... I want to be with her again... My sweet Aster...
Mum...?
I will, won't I? With this... Just a little longer...
Mur, mur!
Guess I should say good morning?
You slept well, didn't you? You look so adorable when you sleep. Sorry about the knocking-you-out thing.
... Enough. I think it's time I gave it a shot.
I'm sorry...for all the trouble I caused you. If something happens to me... Please... Take this little one...
... ... ...OK. Here I go.
"With jewel bright and borrowed might from the spirits of the departed..."
"Through sacred rite, in thy great sight, my life as well I offer..."
The Key Stones that Zinnia holds are giving off a blinding light!
...Ugh...ngh...gh...
"I summon thee...to aid...this fight... and save us...from disaster!"
Kiryararararahhh!!!
!!!
Kiryarassshhhaaahhh!
Ray...quaza!
I did it! I...I did it!
Now the world...will be saved! Aster... Aster, I did it!
Great Rayquaza! Hear my wish! Achieve your Mega Evolution! Take hold of your true power! Show me your true face! The Rayquaza that will save this planet!
... ... ... Zinnia's Key Stone does not react...
Huh?!
H-how can this be?!
I gathered all of the Key Stones that could withstand your great power... and summoned you here... You came...
And yet... Why?!
Come on! Do it! Mega Evolve! Why?! Why won't you...
... ... Zinnia's Key Stone does not react...
Kirrrurrrurrr...
What?!
It can't be... The one without enough power...is you, Rayquaza?
The Meteorites that should lie within Rayquaza's great body...aren't enough? Have these thousand years drained them of their power?
This...can't...be...
I can't...
I... I... Everything...I've done...till now...
Aster... I can't... I can't take any...more...
...
<var>'s Meteorite suddenly began to glow!
That's—?!
The glow of <var>'s Meteorite grew even stronger!
What? That Meteorite?!
It's just like...a Mega Stone?!
Kiryarararaaahhh!!!
Rayquaza swallowed <var>'s Meteorite!
Kirrrihrrrihrrrihhhh!!!
Light is spilling forth from within Rayquaza's body!
Whoa!!!
Swallowing meteorites allows it to store as much power as a Mega Stone. Your Meteorite summoned forth the power needed for Rayquaza to Mega Evolve!
Kirrrihrrrihrrriii!!!
Hah! It's amazing!
<var>! Rayquaza is trying to build up power... It wants power for itself to take you on! Use everything you've got and win over Rayquaza! You have to master it!
If you need a Poké Ball, I've got one!
Kiiiryarrrarrrarrrraaaashiiiii!!!
Is it...over?
Murrrrrr!
... Congratulations, <var>. And...thank you.
History has chosen you... The truth remains that Rayquaza chose you and not me... But... While I don't know how to put it into words exactly... I think I understand why...
...You will be successor to our long history now. And I pass to you the final key to Rayquaza's true power. The move that only it can learn: Dragon Ascent...
<var> succeeded to the power of Dragon Ascent!
...That's it, then.
I guess...it's time that I do my last task as Lorekeeper.
You have obtained Rayquaza's power for your own... Now I will have you prove to me that you can master that power... in battle! That is my final... The final duty of the last Lorekeeper of the Draconid people!
Show me that you can exceed it—the entirety of history that we have clung to until today!
...Phew.
...
My pulse... I can feel it racing...
...Yes. I'm feeling...totally...pumped!
Haaahhh!
This is it!!

...
...
...I guess...it falls to you now...
That settles it, then...
<var>, you should even be able to beat that meteoroid that's approaching the planet. You and Rayquaza...together.
I am leaving this task to you, our new Successor. Successor <var>. You and Rayquaza must protect nature...Pokémon...the people...
Mur!
You received a letter from Aster!
Mur murrr!
"I was finally able to bring everything to an end." "I thank you for that." "I think I'll spend some time now trying to find out if it's also possible to forge a new beginning for something once lost." "Until we meet again,                        Zinnia"


...! The stone tablet before you—!!!
Deoxys suddenly disappeared...

<var> wishes to join your party. Please select a Pokémon to send back to your PC Boxes.

You would like to send <var>?
<var> was added to your party!
Rayquaza is trying to build up power... It wants power for itself to take you on! Use everything you've got and win over Rayquaza! You have to catch it!
Kiryassshhhaaahhh!!!
Realize them...upon this world...! For this do I summon thee!
Rayquazaaa!!!
This is the Legendary Pokémon that all Hoenn views as our great protector! And the only one who can direct it now...
It's you! You have to do this!
I turned and looked up there... so that my tears would never, ever fall.
I loved her. I loved her with everything I had...
That's right. I will summon Rayquaza to this world to destroy the meteoroid headed for Hoenn.
That is my... It is our duty.
