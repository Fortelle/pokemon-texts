I'll have Cosplay Pikachu change into a great costume!
Oh, you've come with Cosplay Pikachu! Do you think your Pikachu wants to change costumes?
Really? Come back and see me if you change your mind!
Change which Cosplay Pikachu?
Oh my! That Pokémon can't wear a costume.
Sorry, Eggs can't wear a costume.
OK! What type of costume does <var> want to wear?
Cool
Beautiful
Cute
Clever
Tough
Remove costume
Quit
<var> happily changed its costume!
<var> wants to learn the move <var>. However, <var> already knows four moves. Should a move be deleted and replaced with <var>?
Give up on learning the move <var>?
<var> did not learn <var>. <var> gave up on changing its costume.
Is it OK to forget the move <var>?
1, 2, and... ... ... Ta-da! <var> forgot how to use <var>. And...
<var> learned <var>!
<var> forgot <var>...
Oh, <var> is already wearing that costume. But you want a change, right?
<var> took off its costume!
Oh! <var> isn't wearing a costume!
<var> gave up on changing its costume.
Hi! Have you got a minute?
I just saw the Contest Spectacular. Your costume in the contest suited you perfectly! Your look inspired me. I rushed out and created a matching costume for a Pokémon!
I know a very fashion-conscious Pikachu called Cosplay Pikachu, and I let it wear the costume! Cosplay Pikachu is a special Pikachu! It's very, very, very fashionable, and any costume looks fantastic on the Pikachu! You'll really, really, really stand out if you two go on stage with matching costumes!
I'm making costumes for the Contest Spectacular! There are more costumes for Cosplay Pikachu, so please drop by the dressing room! Take good care of Pikachu!
Uh... Your Box is full... I'll let you have the Pikachu next time! See you!
Oh! You came here to get the fashion-conscious Cosplay Pikachu. Go on stage with matching costumes!
Take good care of that Pikachu!
Would you like to give your Cosplay Pikachu a nickname?
Hmmm. What should I do? I can't come up with an idea for a really fashionable Pikachu costume... I wonder if I could get some inspiration from seeing a wonderful Trainer in a Contest Spectacular.
It's a wardrobe!
