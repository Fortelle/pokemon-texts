I'm known as the Day Care Man. I help take care of the precious Pokémon of Trainers like you. If you'd like us to raise a Pokémon for you, have a word with my wife.
Why, you again! Good to see you back. Your <var>'s doing fine.
Good to see you back! Your <var> and your <var> are doing just fine. Those two seem to get along like a house on fire.
Good to see you back! Your <var> and your <var> are doing just fine. Those two seem peaceable enough toward each other.
Good to see you back! Your <var> and your <var> are doing just fine. But I have to say, those two don't seem to like each other all that much.
Good to see you back! Your <var> and your <var> are doing just fine. Those two would really rather play with other Pokémon, though, and not each other.
Ah! You're back! We were raising your Pokémon and, me oh my, were we surprised! While we were caring for it, your Pokémon somehow found an Egg! Don't know where it might've come from, but your Pokémon ended up with it. You'll be wanting it, won't you?
<var> received the Egg from the Day Care Man.
Be sure you take good care of it!
You've got no room for an Egg now... Come back when you've made some space.
I'll take it off your hands, then. Be honest—you do want it, don't you?
Well then, I'll be having this one! Thanks!
I'm the Day Care Lady, dearie. We can raise your Pokémon for you here at our Pokémon Day Care. Would you like us to raise one?
I'm the Day Care Lady. We can raise your Pokémon for you here at our Pokémon Day Care. What can we do you for today?
Righty-oh. Come again.
My husband was looking for you, you know.
If you leave me that Pokémon, what will you battle with? Come back when you have more of a team.
Which Pokémon shall we raise for you?
Oh... That is naught but an Egg!
Righty-oh. We'll raise your <var> for a while.
Come back for it later, though.
We can take up to two of your Pokémon. Would you like us to raise one more?
Oh, so you've come again! You have mighty spirited Pokémon, you know. Are you here to take one back?
Well, we've raised your <var> up by about <var> levels.
If you'll be wanting your <var> back now, it will cost you $<var>.
Oopsie! It looks as though your purse is a little light at the moment...
<var> took back hiser <var> from the Day Care Lady.
You wanna take the other one back, too?
Oh me... If you leave a Pokémon with me, you'll be left with only the one. You'd better go catch some more before you try such a thing.
Oh me, your Pokémon team is full up! Make room, and then come see me again.

Oh?
<var> hatched from the Egg!
Would you like to give a nickname to the newly hatched <var>?
Hi, I'm the Day Care Lad! It's my job to help take care of other Trainers' precious Pokémon. If you want us to raise your Pokémon, please go inside and talk to my big sister.
Hi there! <var>'s doing just fine!
Hi there! Your <var> and <var> are doing just fine. They really seem to like hanging out!
Hi there! Your <var> and <var> are doing just fine. The two seem to get along all right.
Hi there! Your <var> and <var> are doing just fine. But they don't seem to like each other very much...
Hi there! Your <var> and <var> are doing just fine. Seems they'd rather play with other Pokémon— not so much with each other.
Oh hey! When we were raising your Pokémon, something amazing happened! It somehow ended up holding an Egg! I have no idea where it came from. It's like a total mystery! You've gotta want it, right?
<var> received the Egg from the Day Care Lad.
There you go! Take good care of it!
Ah! You've got a whole team already! There's no space for this Egg now. Why don't you deposit one of your Pokémon in the PC to make space?
If you don't want it, I'll keep it! But you've gotta want it, right?
Really really? Well... I'll keep it, then! Thanks!
Welcome to the Pokémon Day Care. We're happy to raise your Pokémon here! Would you like to entrust us with your Pokémon?
Welcome to the Pokémon Day Care. We're happy to raise your Pokémon here! How can we help you today?
Come again, then!
My little brother has been looking for you! He's probably out front. Go see him!
If you let me take that Pokémon now, you'll have no one left to battle with! I just can't let you do that!
Which Pokémon should we raise for you?
I'm so sorry, but we aren't set up to raise Eggs here...
Got it! We'll raise your <var> for a while.
You can come and pick it up anytime!
We can take up to two Pokémon per Trainer. Would you like us to raise another?
We've had a great time with your Pokémon, but are you here to make a pickup?
Your <var> has grown by <var> levels during its stay with us.
If you're going to collect your <var> now, you will owe us $<var>. Is that OK?
Oh, you don't have that much money...
<var> took <var> back from the Pokémon Day Care.
Do you want to collect your other Pokémon now, too?
Oh! If you leave a Pokémon with me, you'll be left with only one! I just can't let you do that!
Your team is all full, so I can't return your Pokémon to you. You could drop one off in a PC Box to make space.
