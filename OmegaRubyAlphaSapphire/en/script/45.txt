It seems to me that the more I walk with my Pokémon, the friendlier they become toward me.
I gave a Red Pokéblock to my Pokémon. It looks a lot cooler all of a sudden. Hmm... Maybe I ought to eat a Red Pokéblock.
How disappointing. Traveled all the way from Kalos dreaming of the hot springs over there... Come to find they are for Pokémon only... Sigh. It can't be helped. It seems there are hot springs in the Gym, too, so I should give them a try...
Moomoo Milk? It's great before entering the hot spring! And even better afterward. How about some?
I'll take one.
I'll take a dozen!
I'll pass.
Here's your Moomoo Milk. Drink up!
It's $500 for one bottle!
It's $6,000 for a dozen!
Well, now I feel udder-ly useless!
You don't have enough money.
You can't buy any more.
Aha! Pokémon Journal Use a Fire-type move on a frozen Pokémon, and you can melt the ice.
