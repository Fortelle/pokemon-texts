Give it up, you bozos! Let the professor go!
Hey! You jerks! Let Professor Cozmo go!
Hyuh? What have we here? Why has this child suddenly appeared?
Hahn? What's this? Who is this spoiled brat?
<var>! You came!
<var>! You finally made it, huh!
We've got to save Professor Cozmo from these people!
We've gotta protect the professor from these lunatics or else!
There are two of them... And two of us... <var>, please! Battle together with me!
There's two of them... And two of us, huh? Sorry to ask, <var>, but... Battle alongside me!
What?! Ah! I get it! You've got to get ready first? I'll hold them here, so hurry!!
So even you get nervous, huh... I get it. I'll wait till you get ready.
Thanks a mill!
Thanks, pal!
Ahyahyahya! Isn't this amusing?! Is it really your intention to oppose me, a Team Magma Admin, just the two of you? Mmm... Very well then! I'll show you how terrifying adults can be! Ahyahyahya! I'm going to give you some very thorough coaching!
Ah! So even I, Team Aqua Admin Shelly, have been made a fool. ...Fine! Brats who don't know how to watch their mouths must be punished! I won't forgive you if you cower in fear either! Wahahaha!
This'll be my first time battling beside you, <var>! I've got to do my best!
All right! Let's do this!
Hyuhn?! An unexpected development?!
Ahhh?! Did I go too easy on you?!
We did it, <var>!
All right! We beat 'em!
You children! I would like you to stay out of my way! Team Magma's scientific prowess, Mt. Chimney's energy... And the hidden power of the Meteorite! If we combine them all, a super-ancient Pokémon...
If the tremendous energy of Mt. Chimney and the Meteorite are combined, we of Team Aqua can take a giant step toward the world that we dream of! We won't let ignorant little brats get in our way!
Hmph... Do these mere children give you so much trouble? You—an Admin of Team Aqua...
Bwahahahahahaha! You lost to this scamp? What a pathetic bunch! You lazy stooges will be the downfall of Team Magma!
Wh-who's there?!
Who's that?!
Hyahya! Even Team Aqua is making an appearance! The odds do not appear to be in my favor...
Hmph! Even Team Magma showed their faces, huh? There's nothing to be done about it...
You there! I'll have the Meteorite now!
Hey! Grab that Meteorite!
Yes, sir!
Aye aye!
Wha-wha-wha-what?!
Come now! Hand over the Meteorite!
Come on! Hand over the Meteorite!
Augh?!
Professor!
Professor!
Ahyahya! The Meteorite is in the palm of my hand! Well, well, well... Adios to each and every one of you! At long last I'm off to Mt. Chimney!
Ahahaha! Later days, brats and Team Magma! All right, time to rush to Mt. Chimney!
Hmph...
Tch!


Maxie... We must give chase to Team Aqua or else...
Archie! We will go after those monsters!
Hmm...
That's right! We're not letting them get away!
... My name is Maxie. I lead an organization known as Team Magma. We work for the future happiness of all mankind. From what I have seen here, it appears that you are working against our rivals in Team Aqua. ...Fine. Amuse yourself with those Team Aqua fools. But be careful you do not impede our goals. Be you child or grown, oppose us in the slightest, and I, the great Maxie, will show no mercy!
Oh? What's this? You've got quite a fierce expression on you for such a wee little thing. The name's Archie. I'm the leader of Team Aqua, a group that's working to return the world to a pristine state. One that'll be perfect for Pokémon's survival. Looks like you were getting into it with Team Magma there, 'less my eyes deceive me. It's not like I'm in a position to argue if that's what you're up to, hey? But I'll tell you this much. So remember. If you next get in the way of Team Aqua, you won't get off so lightly. So steer clear and keep your nose clean, scamp! I imagine I'll be seeing you! Waha! Bwahahahahah!
Oh bother! I have no idea what's going on anymore with all these people!
Oh man... What's with those lunatics?
Never mind those nuts! Professor, you doing OK?!
Forget those guys! Professor! Hey! Professor Cozmo! Hang in there, OK?
B-but...they... I...only...
Looks like he's still pretty out of it...
I think he's still pretty out of it...
<var>...
<var>...
Never mind what's happened! I've got to get the professor back to his lab in Fallarbor!
Never mind what's happened! I've got to get the professor back to his lab in Fallarbor!
OK, Professor... Easy now...
OK, Professor... Easy now...















That silver-haired dreamboat said he was headed back to Rustboro.
...
Mum...
Aster...
It's over... It's all over...
...Zinnia, my child.
...Grannie.
...You have worked so hard.
...
...It is enough, child. ...Be done with your burden. Let it go now. For everything there must be an ending. Only then... Only then can there be a new beginning. This is immutable truth that all living things on this planet, great and small, must accept. We Draconids have seen it in our history, as you have seen it in your own life.
Now is the time for rest. Let down the great burden you have borne so long alone... So that you might at last take a step forward toward new life. Now is the time for rest...
...
... Yes.
Child, you...
I heard of what happened from Zinnia. The Draconids owe you much. Thank you, child.
Zinnia has gone on a journey. A journey to find herself this time.
Ah, yes... She did leave this for you, though. I hope you will accept it.
I wonder what kind of future Zinnia might find for herself, now that she is free from the fate of the Draconids. Though I don't think that I need worry about it.
Ah, yes. If ever your Rayquaza forgets how to use Dragon Ascent, come call upon me. I may not seem like much, but I am also one of the last Draconids. I can help the Dragon lord remember that grand move.
