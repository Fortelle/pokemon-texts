This is the Pokémon Lottery Corner. All shoppers visiting our department store get to draw a Pokémon Loto Ticket. If the Loto Ticket's number matches the ID number of any of your Pokémon, you will receive a fabulous gift. Would you like to try it?
Please pick a Loto Ticket. ...

The Loto Ticket number is <var>. I need to check this number to see if it matches any of your Pokémon's ID numbers. Please wait a moment.
Spectacular! The ID number of your team's <var> matches your Loto Ticket number!
Congratulations! The ID No. of the <var> in your PC Box matches your Loto Ticket number!
My goodness, all five digits matched! You've won the jackpot prize, a Master Ball!
Four digits matched, so you win first prize! You've won a Rare Candy!
Three digits matched, so you win second prize, a PP Max!
Two digits matched, so you win third prize! You've won a PP Up!
One digit matched, so you win fourth prize! You've won a Moomoo Milk!
I'm sorry. None of the numbers matched.
We look forward to seeing you again soon!
You can only win once per day. Please come again tomorrow!
