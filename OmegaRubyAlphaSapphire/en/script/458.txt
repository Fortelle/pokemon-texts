Welcome home, <var>! It looks like you and your Pokémon have been working hard out there. It's straight off to bed for you!
Much better! You and your Pokémon are both bursting with energy now! You know, <var>, when your Pokémon get run down, you can come on home for a while. Remember what your dad always says... The world of Pokémon battling is not a forgiving one. Never assume your team can win if it's not in top form! Stay safe out there, <var>, and come home again soon! Do your best, but know your limits!
First, let's restore your Pokémon to full health.
Please visit a Pokémon Center if your Pokémon's HP goes down. If you're planning to travel any great distance, you should stock up on Potions at a Poké Mart. Good luck out there, Trainer!
There! All happy and healthy! Good luck and take care!
