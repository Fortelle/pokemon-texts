Instructions on how to use the panel that controls the locks are written here.
Hehehe!
We finally meet again.
Hm? Ah... Is this the first time we've met?
Nincompoop! It doesn't matter!
Brace yourself! We'll show you the power of quintuplets!
Hah, hah, hah...
We lost...
It's odd. I can't believe five of us couldn't defeat just one Trainer. Did you cheat? Grumble, grumble...
Nincompoop! You're strong, aren't you? Stop whining!
Our leaders are ahead! You have no chance to defeat them!
Our leader's room isn't here. You're the second person to make this mistake. There was also a girl with a Whismur.
The girl who came here asking where our leader's room was... I learned she was an intruder. My next bonus will be cut for sure. Leader Maxie is a scary man...
