PP Up is great! It raises the maximum Power Points, or PP, of a Pokémon move.
B-BuzzNav... It's showing this town! Sootopolis is on TV! Look! Right there! There I am, fleeing inside! In full color!
Do you know Full Restore? Full restoration of Pokémon's HP! Eradication of all status conditions! It's truly an item of your dreams!
It seems like this extreme weather is not just affecting Sootopolis, but Lilycove and Mossdeep, too. Have we awoken some terrible power, to cause all this mayhem?

You there! You call yourself a fan? Then answer this! Who is the cutest idol in the world?
Whaaat?! Are you mad? What a hopeless fool!
What! How dare you sound so unsure! And no true fan calls her by her real name! You have to call her by her nickname: Lissi! But at least you answered the question right. I'll offer you this as a reward for being able to see the true attractiveness of our lovely Lissi!
I've been to every one of her shows since her debut! I've sent her more than 1,000 fan letters! I came all the way here on a pilgrimage, because I've heard that Lissi has some connection to this town! I am prepared to watch over her until I die! No, even after I die. I'll never stop watching her!
Ahh. I wonder if Lissi's OK.
Maybe Lisia?
I'd say <var>.
