Decorations you buy here are sent to the PC exclusively for your Secret Base. How great is that! Would be even greater if they could deliver me home, too!
I'm buying a pretty desk, and I'm going to put it in my Secret Base! And I'm going to put a lot of Azurill Dolls on my desk and on the floor!
Yo-o-o-o, <var>! I knew we'd meet again!
What? You don't know where you are? This is the Secret Base Guild, of course! Huh? Whaddaya mean you never asked? Oh, you! No need to be shy, my boygirl! The Secret Base Guild is here to fully support everyone so they can have a Secret Base life full of adventure!
We can give you hints on how to enjoy your base, and items you can't get anywhere else! And, best of all, coming here means that you can always meet me! Anytime you want!
Y'know, <var>, that reminds me... You still haven't made yourself a team, have you? See, a team is made up of, like, the pals that hang out in your base with you. I guess you could just call 'em friends, but doesn't "team" sound cooler? When you meet people in other bases, you can ask 'em to join your team! Nothing wrong with playing alone, course, but having some pals around sure can liven things up in your base! If you haven't tried it yet, I think you oughta give it a shot before you write it off!
Mm-hmmm! I get it. So you made yourself a team, huh? Team <var>! Yeah, it sounds like it's full of adventure! Not a bad name at all!
Oh yeah! You've been collecting flags, little pal? Here at the Secret Base Guild, we assign ranks to all the teams based on how many flags they've managed to get, see. The more Secret Bases you find and the more flags you snag, the higher you and your team will end up in the ranking!
Huh? You wanna know why we do that? Ain't it obvious? It's more fun that way! A bit of rivalry gets everybody fired up! And doesn't it seem full of adventure to be on an endless hunt for more flags? The higher your rank gets, the richer your base life will become. You'll see! So go out there and find those flags, and then bring 'em here to show me!
So lemme give a gift to my fellow base fanatic, for coming so far to see me here!
A Proclamation will let you set the battle format that will fly in your own base. There are lots of Decorations with special and cool effects like that! Whenever you get a new bit of swag for your digs, check it out to see what it does! And enjoy the base life!
Hi! Do people tell you that you look like <var>?
Oh... Then what do you think you look like?
I knew it! I just knew it!
Oh, <var>! Now that you say it, I think you're right.

Yo-o-o-o, <var>! Didja need me for something?
Yo-o-o-o-o, <var>! So you finally reached <var>! I knew you'd be the one to do it for me, if anyone could!
See, truth is... There's something I've been keeping to myself. There's an even higher rank you could achieve. It's a secret rank, get me?
And that rank is called <var>! You'll need a frankly freakish <var> flags in order to go up in rank again, though! I know, I know, right? It's a crazy number. Maybe too big for anyone to ever hit. But I just don't wanna put a limit on how much adventure waits out there!
C'mon, <var>! Make yours the grandest adventure yet!
Let's see those flags.
Let's have a battle!
How about a picture?
Nothing.
All right! I'll accept that challenge! Oh, yeah. So the battle format here in the Secret Base Guild is Single Battles. Sound good?
I'm good to go anytime! Just come talk to me!
Good work out there, <var>! Phew! Battling you felt like a real adventure! Let's do it again sometime!
Sounds good enough! Me and Flygon have gotten stronger. The battle format is still Single Battles, of course. You cool with that?
Good job there, <var>! You're pretty good at Pokémon battling, too, huh? Let's do this again sometime!
OK, let's see here... Team <var>'s flag collection is now all the way up to... Wow! That's <var>! And you need <var> flags to move up to the <var>! Typical <var>! You hardly even broke a sweat, didja? Here ya go! Proof of your new rank!
You received the <var>!
Team <var> has reached the <var>! Now your Secret Pals will be able to use <var> special skills!
Oh yeah! One more thing! Take this while you're here!
Now that you've reached <var>, I wanna see you have a real fine adventure! Next up is <var>! You'll need <var> flags for that! The hurdle has gotten higher, but I know you'll do it for me, <var>!
Oh! I remembered something else! You oughta check out the shop, 'cause more will be available now that you've gone up a rank! Good luck to you! Have an awesome Secret Base life!
OK, let's see here... Team <var>'s flag collection is now all the way up to... Wow! That's <var>! And you need <var> flags to move up to the <var>!
Just what I'd expect of Team <var>! So you made it to <var> at last... I can just feel the adventure waftin' around you! Your team really is something, you know? Almost too much something... Ahhh, so excited I nearly forgot to give you your proof!
You received the <var>!
Team <var> has reached the <var>! Now your Secret Pals can use all of their special skills!
This is a little present for Team <var>!
Hrmmm. I've gotta capture this super moment forever somehow...
That's it! So you'll never forget the thrill of adventure when you reached <var>... How 'bout we take a picture of Team <var> right now? That's it! I'm a genius!
Now that it's decided, I can't wait another moment! You'd better get ready, too, <var>!
All right! Everybody's here, yeah? Then here we go... Say cheese!
<var>!
And it's...perfect! Man, what a great shot!
Man, I'm gonna keep this photo in the album in my heart forever! ...You and your teammates sure are super, you know? A super team... The Super Team <var>! That's what we oughta call you! You keep having a blast with your Secret Base out there, pal!
OK, lemme see here... Team <var>'s flag collection is now all the way up to... That's <var>! And you need <var> flags to move up to the <var>! ...
S-seriously? <var>! <var>!!! You guys have finally reached <var>! I've never seen anything so super! That's it! I'm giving the best-ever certificate to the best-ever team!
You received the <var>!
Team <var> has reached the <var>! Now your Secret Pals will be able to use special skills twice a day!
And I've got a gift for the best-ever team, too!
And I'll give you this fella, too! It doesn't do a thing for me and my loyal Flygon here... But you get the adventure of battle, so I figure you oughta be up for it!
There's nothing left I can even say! You are a Secret Base master! I just hope you'll keep showing others the adventure that awaits in base life! I'll always be here, of course, so feel free to stop by anytime!
Looks like you haven't made a team for yourself yet. Try getting some pals together! That's the first step!
OK, lemme see here... Team <var>'s flag collection is now all the way up to... Whoa! That's <var>! Just what I'd expect of Team <var>! There's nothing left I can even say! I hope you'll keep showing others the adventure to be had in base life!
OK, lemme see here... Team <var>'s flag collection is now all the way up to... Oooh. That's <var>! And you need <var> flags to move up to the <var>! Looks like you still need <var> more. Hmm. I guess you oughta go check out lots of other people's bases, huh?
OK! I'm gonna take a picture! Get ready!
Super! Another awesome shot! If you ever wanna retake your photo, just say the word!

Are you inviting pals to your Secret Base? You can invite up to five people as your pals to your base. There are many different types of people with different special skills. For example, I'm an Ace Trainer and good at doing exercise with Pokémon!
