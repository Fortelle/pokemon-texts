This crater was created when a huge meteoroid crashed into the earth here... Over time, the crater filled with rainwater, and that is how the city of Sootopolis came to be.
This narrow cave is all that links Sootopolis to the outside world. It's almost as though this place was made to keep something from getting out... Or am I just imagining things?
