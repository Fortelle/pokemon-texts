Our Gym Leader told us to pull out all the stops to beat you. Even if you do happen to be the Leader's own sondaughter!

The way you handle your Pokémon reminds me of your father's style. Go on through! The Gym Leader—no, your father— is waiting!
It's OK to focus on making your Pokémon stronger. But what truly determines the winner of a battle? It's the feelings Trainers have for their Pokémon.
