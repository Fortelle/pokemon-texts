Let me see how friendly your Pokémon is toward you. Oh. Your Pokémon...
It's extremely friendly toward you. It couldn't possibly love you more. It's a pleasure to see!
It seems to be very happy. It's obviously friendly toward you.
It's quite friendly toward you. It seems to want to be babied a little.
It's getting used to you. It seems to believe in you.
It's not very used to you yet. It neither loves nor hates you.
It's very wary. It has a scary look in its eyes. It doesn't like you much at all.
This is a little hard for me to say... Your Pokémon simply detests you. Doesn't that make you uncomfortable?
Skiski?
