Young one... Use this and awaken your Pokémon's hidden powers...
When a Pokémon learns the move Hidden Power, somehow I can tell what type that move will be... Want to know what type of Hidden Power your Pokémon will learn?
I'm just a powerless old woman, but I can tell you the type of Hidden Power your Pokémon would have, if you like?
If this Pokémon were to learn Hidden Power, the move's type would be...<var>.
The type of this Pokémon's Hidden Power is <var>...
When you want to know, ask this powerless old woman!
No Egg can use Hidden Power...
It's a shame, but this Pokémon can't learn Hidden Power...
