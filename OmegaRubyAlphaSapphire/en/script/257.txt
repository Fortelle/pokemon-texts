Hot diggidy! That's a Volcanion you have there, isn't it?
As far as I know, the people in that group are the only ones in history to have seen this Pok√©mon. To think that I'd meet a Trainer who not only found Volcanion, but actually caught it!
What a day! I like you, kid! I'm the head of this TV studio. How about I show you some top-secret specials we made about Volcanion?
They're a little something I made for a TV show once back in the day, but... Well, things didn't work out, and they ended up getting shelved.
OK! Sit back and enjoy! My top-secret Volcanion specials!
