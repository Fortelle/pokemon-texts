Hm... So you did get four Gym Badges.
Then, as I promised, we will have a Pokémon battle.
<var>...
It makes me happier than I can really describe. Being able to have a real battle with my own sondaughter like this.
But a battle is a battle!
I will do everything within my power as a Gym Leader to win!
You'd better give it your best shot, too, <var>!

I can't believe it.
I lost to <var>?
... ... You've come this far...
That's how it is, then! I will give you this.
<var> received the Balance Badge from hiser dad!
Having that Badge will ensure that Pokémon up to Lv. 60 will obey you, even if you received them in trades.
Pokémon that know the HM move Surf will also be able to travel over water now.
And this is my gift to you, <var>. I'm sure you'll be able to use it well.
Retaliate will allow you to take revenge for a fallen team member. Its power will be doubled if you have a Pokémon use it in the very next move right after an ally faints. I hope you and your Pokémon will be diligent enough to use it wisely.
... Sigh.
As the Gym Leader, I can't express how frustrated I am.
But, as a father, it makes me both happy and a little sad. It's odd.
... Come on, <var>.
I'll see you on your way. Let's get out of here.
