Where has Wally gone? He should be leaving for Verdanturf Town soon.




My face is reflected in the water. It's a shining grin full of hope... Or maybe it's a look of somber silence struggling with fear... What do you see in your face?
Now, ladss, let's say you have six Pokémon in your team and then you catch another one... Do you know what happens? It's automatically sent to a storage Box over the PC network!
Petalburg City Pokémon Gym Leader: Norman A man in pursuit of power!
Petalburg City Where people mingle with nature.
Wally's House
Ah! <var>! Mr. Norman!
I haven't seen the two of you in some time. What a coincidence! I just came back to my parents' house to grab something I'd forgotten.
You look like you've been working hard, Wally. It's clear even without a battle.
R-really? You really think so? Hehe... Thank you! That's so nice of you to say!
Ah. <var>, isn't it?
Ah. <var>, isn't it?
I'm glad to see you here. I'm Wally's father, of course.
As you can see, Wally's health has thoroughly improved.
It's all thanks to you and your father. You two helped Wally catch his first Pokémon that day. It's because of you that he has a partner of his own now. That partner is why he's grown so strong. That's my firm belief. So, I thank you.
Yes, that's it. Sometimes words aren't enough. It would delight me if you'd take this.
If you're cleared to use Surf outside of battle, you'll be able to cross seas with your Pokémon.
<var>... Considering how much you and Wally have grown, you should be able to handle what lies beyond the sea on Route 118 now. There are far stronger Pokémon and Trainers waiting for you on Hoenn's east coast. Continue your journey and your adventures there. I know you'll do your best!
Yes, sir! I will do my best to become as strong as <var>, sir!
I guess I had better start out, then. I'm off for now, Dad! See you next time!
Um. Come on, <var>! Let's go together!
Wally... I look forward to seeing you and your Pokémon grow stronger together.
<var>? Well, take care of yourself out there. Don't forget to drop by Littleroot to visit your mother from time to time!
OK! We're off!
Be safe out there!
Learn a lot!
...
...
I don't know what it is, but...
...Hm?
Seeing my little boy all grown up and going off on his own... As a father, it makes me happy and a little sad...
Hahahah! What a coincidence! I caught myself thinking the same thing.
Hohoho! Is that so?
... But if only... If only my boy keeps growing strong and healthy like that... I wouldn't ask for anything else.
Yes. I know exactly what you mean.
Mr. Norman told us to keep going beyond Route 118, didn't he... Let me check my AreaNav...
Route 118 is the one east of Mauville City, huh?
<var>! Since we're both here anyway, let's go to Mauville together! I'm definitely planning on going to check out Route 118 like your dad said!
Not bad... It was a good battle.
Th-thank you, sir!
Come back and challenge me again anytime. I'll be looking forward to seeing you and your Pokémon again when you're a bit stronger.
Yes, sir! Thank you, sir! I'm gonna do special training with my Pokémon. Then I'll challenge this Gym again!
Thank you for the battle, Mr. Norman!
Hm?
Why, if it isn't <var>!
So you've finished moving in?
I see... Well... I guess we shouldn't stand around out here talking. Do you want to come in for a bit?
We can talk in the Gym.
Tedious... bothersome...child... You should... just be quiet... and give me...the Key Stone!
I'm telling you I don't have it!
I already know... that you can... use...Mega Evolution!
Argh! Are you even listening? I've been telling you— Ah! <var>!
...?!
...You.
Aha. ♪ Nice timing...maybe. ♪
I'll be taking... yours first! Give me... the Key Stone!
Huh...
...No! You're always meddling!
If that's...how it is... at Meteor Falls... the Leader's...Key Stone...
Thank you so much, <var>... That strange woman suddenly attacked me, demanding that I hand over my Key Stone... The truth is that I couldn't give it to her even if I wanted to. My Key Stone is gone... I left it in the house when I went out, and it just disappeared. What in the world is going on...
If someone like that ever shows up again... I've gotta protect my mom and dad. You be careful, too, <var>!
You're such a little pain! Shut up and give me the Key Stone!
I don't have it, I tell you!
Don't play dumb! I already know you can use Mega Evolution!
Argh! Are you even listening? I've been telling you— Ah! <var>!
What the?!
You punk!
Hoohahaha! Just in time, aren't you?
I'm gonna take your Key Stone first, you jerk!
Hooaahhh!
You clown! Always gettin' all up in my business!
If it's gonna be like that, I'm off to Meteor Falls.
Thank you so much, <var>. That strange man suddenly attacked me, demanding that I hand over my Key Stone. The truth is I couldn't give it to him even if I wanted to. My Key Stone is gone... I left it in the house when I went out, and it just disappeared. What in the world is going on?

The Entry Call (Ver. 0.09) app rang on your PokéNav Plus!
???: ...'Lo? Hello?
???: ...Is that you, <var>?
???: ...Is that you, <var>?
Steven: It's me. Steven. Have you been doing well? Steven: Heh... I imagine you must be quite shocked. Steven: This is a communication mode that Devon is still currently developing. It comes installed on every PokéNav Plus. Steven: I thought I would only use it if I needed to contact you urgently... Steven: But it looks as though that time has already come. Steven: I'm sorry to ask this of you, but I need you to come to the Devon Corporation in Rustboro. Steven: There's something I have to talk to you about—in person... Steven: I'll be waiting for you there.
...Kzt!
So we're here. Petalburg City.
<var>, you do your best with the Gym. I'm behind you all the way.
See ya!
Well, we made it! The Petalburg City Gym!
Good luck with taking on the Gym Leader, <var>. I'm cheering for you!
Later!
