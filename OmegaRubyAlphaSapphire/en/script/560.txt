We're developing a device for talking with Pokémon. But we haven't had much success...
I'm developing new kinds of Poké Balls... But I haven't made much headway...
We've finally made some new kinds of Poké Balls! The Repeat Ball makes it easier to catch Pokémon you've caught before. The Timer Ball gets better at catching Pokémon the longer a battle runs. Both are proudly developed by the Devon Corporation. Please give them a try!
I made the PokéNav Plus! As an engineer, I feel blessed to have made something so great!
Wow! That's a PokéNav Plus! It's a navigation system for connecting people, Pokémon, and the world! That was the idea of our president, and I made it a reality. Would you like me to describe its features in detail? No, no. I think you'll find out just by trying the PokéNav Plus for yourself.
I'm trying to develop a device that visually reproduces the dreams of Pokémon... And I've heard that my rival, who lives far away, is doing the same research! I can't lose this race.
