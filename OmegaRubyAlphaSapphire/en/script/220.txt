Mr. Briney lives in that little cottage there, beside the sea. He was once an amazing sailor who never feared the sea, however stormy.
Ah, the sea. I wonder what it's like at the bottom of the sea.
If you're going to throw a Poké Ball, weaken the wild Pokémon first. It'll be easier to catch if it's been poisoned, burned, lulled to sleep, or suchlike.
You're no better than a thief if you try to steal someone else's Pokémon. You should only throw Poké Balls at wild Pokémon you encounter.
Oh no, I'm not a Trainer! But it's true that Trainers locking eyes is basically an invitation to battle. If you don't want to battle with people, try to stay out of their line of sight!

I kept encountering the same kind of Pokémon. Then the DexNav got better, and now I can find rare Pokémon easily.
My Pokémon is staggeringly tired... I should have brought a Potion.
Will you give him one of your Potions?
What?! Th-thank you!
What?! Th-thank you!
<var> handed the boy a Potion!
Thank you so much! Thanks to you, my Pokémon made a complete recovery!
Hoh hoh hoh hoh! My pretty Peeko's as full of energy as usual!
Pi-kwee!
