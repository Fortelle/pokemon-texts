They say, here in Hoenn, there are places called Mirage spots. One does not simply walk into a Mirage spot. Not to mention that these places also appear and disappear mysteriously.
I've been to a Mirage spot... I'm sure of it. But I forgot where it is... I used to be very good at remembering things... I'm so shocked that I can't remember...
Mirage spots... It must be the weather conditions that seem to make them visible at some times and not others. Or are they truly appearing and disappearing?
