Ai! You've made it this far? Hmm... You're sharp!


It took me all night to plant those trees... You're almost my equal in greatness by one, two, three, four places!
It took me all night to shove in those boulders... You're almost my equal in greatness by one, two, three places!
It took me all night to board up the windows to make the room dark. You're almost my equal in greatness by one, two places!
It took me all night to bring in those boulders... You're almost my equal in greatness!
It took me all night to make Mechadolls and another night to think up the quiz... You're my equal in greatness!
It took me all night placing arrows... You even exceed me in greatness! Possibly...
Wh-what should I do? My fountain of ideas for tricks has run dry... Perhaps it is time I toured the country on a quest to devise new tricks...
I hate to admit defeat, but you have bested me! Still, you must have been reeled in by my charisma for you to visit me again and again. Yes, you must have! But that has nothing to do with my losing! In recognition of the friendship between you, the driven, and the genius that is myself, I demand that you take this keepsake!

... I am leaving on a journey of discovery. A quest in search of new tricks. I wish you will one day visit and entertain me again. And now, farewell!
Great! You have earned this reward!

Scrub that smug smirk from your face! It's much too early to think you've won! I'll make new tricks to stump you, I will. You may mock me only when you're done. Come back for the next exciting installment!
What, what! You're ignoring me now? That, I consider heartbreaking!
