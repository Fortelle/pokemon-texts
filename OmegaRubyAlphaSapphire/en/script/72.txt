It'll be some time before we make land, I reckon. You can rest up in your cabin if you'd like. Your cabin's No. 2. The bed in there is soft and plushy. I can attest to how comfy it is!
We've arrived!
Go visit other cabins. Trainers bored with the boat trip will be itching to battle.
Enjoy your cruise!

Welcome aboard, <var>! They made me honorary captain of this here S.S. Tidal! You can call me Cap'n Briney now! You know, I retired once before, but when I saw this fine ship launched... Let me say it stirred my old sailor's soul, aye, it did!
Peeko: Pi pikwee.

...But I thank ye for coming along.
Briney, it's like the good old days, having you guide the rudder again after all this time. And it's great to see Peeko again, too!
Peeko: Pi pi!
Ohoho! Look how thrilled Peeko is to see her old pal Drake! But no need to keep goin' on about it, mind you. Eh-hrrmm. Anyhow, it's a short crossing, so drink it all in, eh?
Well then, I'll see you later on! Full speed ahead, Briney!
Aye aye, old friend! Full speed ahead.
