I wonder how many kinds of Pokémon there are in the world. I'll trade Pokémon with people in faraway places via the PSS, so someday I can collect all the Pokémon!
I've been hearing about some rotten scoundrels who are nabbing people's Pokémon. I hear one even stole a Meteorite!
Those rotten scoundrels who were stealing people's Pokémon and Meteorites... I don't think I've seen them around lately.
Aha! Pokémon Journal Just like Poison-type Pokémon being immune to poison, Ghost-type Pokémon can flee regardless of Mean Look and Shadow Tag.
