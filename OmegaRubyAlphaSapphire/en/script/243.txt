We've arrived.
Thank you, Latias.
Thank you, Latios.
... I don't know what it is...
Not quite unease, not quite fear... But there is something...unsettling...
It is an odd feeling, as though I am walking in a dream— or an illusion.
I once heard an odd fable. It was said that the two Pokémon that live on this island guard some secret about that great form of Evolution: Mega Evolution. Could it be that some dangerous element is here because of that? ... Come, we should be going.
What is it you want to do? Would you like to return to Route 118 for a time?
I understand.
Latias, if you would oblige...
Latios, if you would oblige...
In that case... Shall we go see once and for all whether there is anything to be found on this island?
Now then... Shall we go see once and for all whether there is anything to be found on this island?

(Those whose memories fade seek to carve them in their hearts...)






Let's drop anchor!
We made it all right... This be Southern Island...
If you want to turn rudder for Slateport again, just come an' say the word. I'll be waiting here.
Hm? You wanna head back to Slateport, do ye?
Aye aye. Let's be off then.
Hyaahhhn...
Shwaahhhn...
