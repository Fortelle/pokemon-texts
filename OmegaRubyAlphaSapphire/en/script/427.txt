Memories of my darling Skitty... My eyes flood just thinking about it.
This used to be a desolate place. The ground had holes here and there, and I used to fall in!



I make a habit of coming here after work at least once a day. I'm afraid of forgetting my Pokémon.
I wonder why cemeteries are built...
I'm so old that all my tears have dried up completely. But my memories flood my mind all the time.
Because I loved my Pokémon very much, I spent a lot of money to get a good spot. You know, you can measure the depth of love by the money you spend.
