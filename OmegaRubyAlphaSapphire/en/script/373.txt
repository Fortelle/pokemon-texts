Are you planning on going deep in there? How about bringing me back some Shoal Salt and Shoal Shells? I can make you something good if you bring me those items.
If you bring me four each of the Shoal Salt and Shoal Shells, I can make you a Shell Bell... You can get more every day.
Oh, hey! Shoal Salt and Shoal Shells! And enough of them, too! Would you like me to make you a Shell Bell with them?
All righty, then! I'll make you a Shell Bell right away. ... There! Done!
Have a Pok√©mon hold on to that. It'll love it, that's for certain. Why, the Shell Bell's chime... It's simply sublime! You can get more Shoal Salt and Shoal Shells every day, so I can always make more.
And... I'm not quite sure what this is, but I got this recently. If you like, please take this, too.
Oh... Is that so...? I wanted to make a Shell Bell...
You wouldn't have space in your Bag even if I were to make one for you. You should make some room and then come back for a Shell Bell.
