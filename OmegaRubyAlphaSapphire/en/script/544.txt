Sniff... Um... You, uh...smell singed. Were you at a volcano or something?
I want to go to the Fortree Gym, but something's blocking the way. After all the bother I went through training my Pokémon on Route 120...
I have my pride-and-joy Pokémon with me. This time, I'll beat Winona.
The ground absorbs rainwater, and trees grow by drinking that water... Our Fortree City exists thanks to our having both earth and water.
This city's homes are built on trees. Perhaps because of that lifestyle, everyone seems healthy and lively. Why, even I do! I feel as if I've grown 30 years younger since I moved here.
Living on top of trees is fine. But sometimes Bug Pokémon come in through the windows. It can cause quite the fright!
Some Pokémon evolve when you Link Trade them with friends.
There's an invisible obstacle in your way.
Would you like to use the Devon Scope?
<var> slipped the Devon Scope on.
A previously invisible Kecleon became visible to the naked eye!
The startled Kecleon fled!
Fortree City The treetop city that frolics with nature.
Fortree City Pokémon Gym Leader: Winona The bird user taking flight into the world.
Hm... It looks as though that Pokémon can be found up on Route 120...
