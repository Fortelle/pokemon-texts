Haiyaaaaaaaaa!
Ugh... It might be impossible.
Waaaaah!!
D-d-don't scare me like that! You scared the living daylights out of me! Hah... Anyway... By any chance did you come here to look for the rare Pokémon, too?
Oh, you don't know the rumor? OK. I'll tell you, then. According to my grandfather, this cave long has been rumored to be the place where a rare Fire-type Pokémon lives. The Pokémon has a magma-like body and sharp claws... But it's too dark to move forward from here without Flash. It's a bit scary. You know, in a pitch-black place like this, if something falls from the ceiling, you can't tell what it is... Eww. I'm thinking about going back to Lavaridge and coming back better prepared. So I'm leaving now, but if you go farther, please be careful!
You, too... Oh, I see. As you may have heard, this cave has long been rumored to be the place where a rare Fire-type Pokémon lives. That's why I came here. But I guess I was a bit ill prepared... I was just thinking about going back to Lavaridge and coming back later. So I'm leaving now, but if you go farther, please be careful!
