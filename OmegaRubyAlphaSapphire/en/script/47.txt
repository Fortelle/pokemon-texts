Yo, how's it going, Champ-to-be <var>? Lavaridge's Gym Leader Flannery uses Fire-type Pokémon. Her passion for Pokémon burns stronger and hotter than a volcano. Don't get too close to her or you might get burned. Hose her down with water and then go for it!
Yow! That was a scorching hot battle!















Welcome!
No, wait. I mean... Puny Trainer, you've done well to make it this far! Let's see. I'm, uh, honored to be serving as the Gym Leader of...
No, I mean... I'm Flannery, and I'm in charge here!
Uh... You'd better not underestimate me just 'cause I've only been Leader a short time!
With the skills inherited from my grandfather, I'm gonna, uh, demonstrate the hot moves we've honed in this land!
Haiyaaaaaaaaaaaaa!

I...I've only recently become a Gym Leader. I guess I was trying too hard to be someone I'm not.
When I don't act like myself, no wonder Pokémon that battle at my side get confused.
Thank you for teaching me that. You deserve this.
<var> received the Heat Badge from Flannery.
If you have a Heat Badge, all Pokémon up to Level 50, even those you get in trades from other people, will obey you completely. And it lets Pokémon use the HM move Strength outside of battle.
This is a token of my appreciation. Don't be shy about taking it!
Overheat is a Fire-type move that inflicts serious damage on the target. But it also sharply cuts the Sp. Atk of the Pokémon using it. It might not be suitable for longer battles.
Your power reminds me of someone... Oh! I know! You battle like Norman, the Gym Leader of Petalburg.

You finally became the Champion. I heard it from Winona in Fortree. The news of your success lit my fire and made me realize again that I have to grow more as a Pokémon Trainer. Thank you for stimulating my spirit!
