Learn moves through dance! This is Move Tutoring Studio Ultimate! We can teach ultimate moves through DANCE, darling! That's what we do! Tell me, darling, shall we teach your lovely little Pokémon some moves?
What do you say? Shall we teach your lovely little Pokémon some moves?
Oops-a-daisy! None of your lovely little Pokémon can learn these ultimate moves! We're pretty exclusive about who we take as students. Talk to the staff if you need to know more!
We'll be waiting for you to waltz back into our lives anytime, darling!
Which Pokémon will be our principal dancer today?
Oops-a-daisy! That Pokémon is hardly up to the challenge of these ultimate moves! Talk to the staff if you need to know more!
Oh sorry, doll. We don't take Eggs in as students at this studio.
Oh...my...goodness! That Pokémon right there is not terribly friendly toward you, is it? Having a good basis of trust with its Trainer is a must for a student.
Ooohhh, your Pokémon already knows any move I could possibly teach it!
Then I'll teach sweet little <var> to use <var>, oui?
