Oh, hello. You are?
OK, you're <var>. I can see that you're a Trainer. So that means you use the Pokémon Storage System I developed. How I arrived at that conclusion is a simple deductive process. You spoke to me because you wanted to access something on this PC.
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm Lanette. Honestly, I'm glad to meet you. It's great you're using the Storage System. If you could, please visit me at home. My house is on Route 114.
I wonder what Pokémon looked like long, long ago. Maybe the Fossil Maniac at the edge of town will know.
In the fields of Fallarbor, we plant seedlings of hardy trees that thrive even in volcanic ash.
Oh... I see. That's how you attract wild Pokémon. Then I don't need this anymore.
Give it a try if you like.
The Aha! Pokémon Journal gives us a lot of useful information, doesn't it? By the way, I have more Honey at home, so I'll bring some more tomorrow.
Hi! I still have some Honey, so take this.
Aha! Pokémon Journal Do you know the Pokémon move called Sweet Scent? If you use it in tall grass, Pokémon come out in a horde!
