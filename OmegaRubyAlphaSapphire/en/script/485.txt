You're a Pok√©mon Trainer, aren't you? Sootopolis's Gym Leader, Wallace, has a lot of fans. Do you have any fans?
Ohhh... Then you must be pretty strong.
Oh dear... That's kinda sad. Put a little work into getting your own fan following!
Dedicated fans flock in, even from as far away as the Kanto and Johto regions. He must be the coolest Water-type Gym Leader in the world!
