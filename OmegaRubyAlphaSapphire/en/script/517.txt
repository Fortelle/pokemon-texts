Welcome to the Lilycove Department Store.
Whenever I come to the department store, I always end up buying all sorts of things because it's so fun.
My mom is going to buy me some nice furniture today.
I'm buying something for my Marill as a reward for winning a Contest Spectacular!
Rillllll!

Hoenn's Local Heroes The Hoenn Rangers Coexistence Force! It's an action figure of the quick-moving but pessimistic hero, Fallarbor Bordeaux. The price tag is peeled off, and you can't tell how much it is.
It's a shiny table. It's polished like it's never been polished before.
There are pamphlets titled "Lilycove Department Store Customer Loyalty Program."
