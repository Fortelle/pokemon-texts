'Sup! This is the Move-Tutoring Dojo! Ya got any Pokémon from a professor? Makes no difference if it's gone ahead an' evolved into something else since then. So long as it's real friendly toward ya, I'll teach it an un-bo-lievable move. Wanna learn a battle-combo move?
We know some real special moves, yo. Wanna learn a battle-combo move?
I can't teach squat to any of the Pokémon ya got with ya.
For reals? Well, see ya next time.
Amazeballs! Which Pokémon will it be, then?
Hey-larious. That Pokémon can't learn my move! Only the Pokémon that profs give ya can learn this move, yo!
Awww, fail! Seriously? Can't teach moves to Eggs!
Man, this Pokémon... It's nowhere near friendly enough to ya. Try again, yo.
Haha, dude, that Pokémon already knows one of my moves, for reals!
So ya wanna teach your <var> <var>? For reals?
Man, the Pokémon ya get from professors are like my peeps, amiright? They're the only ones I wanna teach my awesome moves to! And my dojo right here's the only place in Hoenn that knows these moves, sucker!
