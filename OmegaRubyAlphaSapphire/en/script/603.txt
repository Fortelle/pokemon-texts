Ah, a journey is a wonderful thing! When I was young, I also roamed across the seas and the mountains!
Sigh... I wish I could go on an adventure with Pok√©mon... Crawl through some damp grass... Climb rocky, rugged mountains... Cross the raging seas... Wander about in dark caves... And sometimes get a little homesick... It must be fabulous to travel!
