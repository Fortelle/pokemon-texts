Hey there, Trainer! A Super Rod really is super! Say whatever you want, but this baby can catch Pokémon right off the seafloor! What do you think? You want one, don't you?
You bet, you bet! After all, a Super Rod is the definition of super!
If there's any water, try dropping in your line and see what bites!
You can go after seafloor-dwelling Pokémon with your Super Rod. Drop your line in any water, and see what bites!
Say wha-a-a-a-at? You mean you don't like fishing?
