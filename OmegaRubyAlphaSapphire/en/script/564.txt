I'm buying some Antidotes in case I run into any Shroomish in Petalburg Woods.
My Pokémon evolved and has lots of HP now. I should buy some Super Potions for it instead of ordinary Potions.
I'd sure like an Escape Rope in case I get lost in a cave. With an Escape Rope, it only takes a second to get back to the entrance!
Excuse me, Trainer over there. Do you have a minute? You know, sometimes moves are too strong to catch a Pokémon. You end up making a Pokémon faint even when you don't want to. For such a common problem, use this!
False Swipe is a very handy move. No matter how many times it's used on the opposing Pokémon, it won't cause the Pokémon to faint! I'm offering it for free right now. This is a limited-time promotion!
