Ah! <var>! So you came, too!
Mr. Norman actually gave me a ticket as well. I just got here a little while ago. So this is the Battle Resort... A tropical paradise that only the lucky few get to visit...
Ahyahya! Very well then, Leader Maxie. The time has come for us to...
...Fight!
Hmph.
Oof! Ow!
Hmm?
I'm s-sorry, ma'am, sir... Running into you like that...
Hummph! Sir?!
...Ma'am?!
...
Hey! I, Tabitha, have only just turned 27! How old do you think I am?! I shall never forgive you!
I'll...make him cry...
Ah...
Leader? Is this that child...
Hmm... Indeed. The hero who crushed Team Aqua's hopes and saved the world.
I had not expected to meet you here.
Are you a friend to that young man who just left? His whole body seemed to hum with his eagerness for battle... He must be quite the Trainer.
It seems that I may get to battle both you and that young man here... Fuhaha! It appears that coming to this island may prove worth the trouble yet!
There has been something on my mind ever since the incident in Sootopolis... In another time, or perhaps another world, one only a fraction of an inch removed from our own, it seems very likely that it would have been us in Team Magma standing against you in that battle... Perhaps we would have been the ones trying to revive Groudon and obtain its terrible power for ourselves...
But of course it is pure fantasy. Talking about other worlds, or alternative realities... It is just a dream for those of us living in the present world. Fuhahaha...
Ah, yes. But now that I've had the good fortune to meet you again, I should give you that thing...
Courtney?
...Yes?
You have to...take care of it...
I look forward to a day when my Pokémon team might face yours in battle. Until that day...
Ahya! And with that, we bid you adios!
You...seem fun. ♪ Target...locked...
Aha. ♪
See you later, Archie. Do it right.
Fight on, bro!
Aye aye! Take care of the crew while I'm away!

Hyo!
I'm s-sorry, ma'am, sir... Running into you like that...
Ma'am...
Oho?!
Hmm. Interesting.
Wh-what?! It's that brat! No matter how you look at it, I'm a "miss," not a "ma'am"!
What an honest kid...
Oh!
Huhn?! Is this that kid...
Ahhh, yeah. The scamp of a Trainer who put a stop to Team Magma and that Groudon of theirs.
To think I'd run into you here.
And that little runt there, he's one of your friends? He only passed us by, but I felt a real fire for battle there. He must be some Trainer.
Looks like I'll get to take on the both of you if I keep battling here a while! Bwahahaha! Looks like it won't be a waste that I came all the way out here after all!
I've gotta say...it's been weighing on my mind ever since Sootopolis, but... You know, if we lived in a slightly different world, it might have been me and my crew that you'd had to stop... It's not a stretch to think that we might have tried reviving Kyogre to try to use its power for ourselves... You know?
Bwahahaha! It's nonsense, of course! It's not like there could be another world out there just like ours, eh? That's why we dream, right? Wahaha! 'Cause we know our dreams can't be real!
Ah... But since we did get to run into each other like this... I think I'll give this to you!
Matt!
Yeah, bro!
This is a gift from my bro! Take good care of it.
I look forward to pitting my team against yours someday! See you then!
Wouldn't you know it... He can really make a girl's eyes sparkle. He's always like that when he meets strong Trainers. That's what I like about him, though...
Muwahahahaha! That's fun! You're crazy fun! I can tell how strong you are even though we're not battling!
I'll be looking forward to when me and my bro squash you!
Hmmph...I'd like to go there. If there is a world like that...
Oh-hoh! Sounds fun!
Ahyahya! So very intriguing!
Might be...nice...
I'm getting pumped just standing here! Let's check it out!
