It's my job to go about checking up on the health of all the Pokémon. Having so many Pokémon together in one area means we have to be extra careful of the spread of illness.
You know, we call this place the Safari Zone, but it's really no different than any wild area. There are no cages or walls. The Pokémon are free to come and go as they like.
