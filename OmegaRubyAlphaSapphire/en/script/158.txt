It's a fine printing of an excellent specimen of Water-type Pokémon!
There are all sorts of fishing rods lined up!
Welcome, welcome. This here is 123 Go Fish. And that Poochyena you see there is our "watch Pokémon," Chomper. Chomper's a real glutton, all right. Puts everything in that mouth. If you feel like fishing, though, you're free to fish your heart out in that pond out front.
Play along with an old man, would you? Tell me which Pokémon you like best.
That won't do... No, not at all. It's like you know nothing.
Oh, exactly! You get it, don't you? I'll have to give you something special I've been holding onto!
That there will boost the Defense and Sp. Def of a Pokémon that can still evolve! I have my precious Magikarp hold one. Huhuhuhu...
Unevolved Pokémon just get me right there, you know? They're like... Like a bud that hasn't yet bloomed!
Magikarp
Gyarados
Gromp gromp gromp...
It seems like something is bothering Chomper... Could you give it a little scratch?
Grrrmph! Rahk! Hack!
Grrromp!
