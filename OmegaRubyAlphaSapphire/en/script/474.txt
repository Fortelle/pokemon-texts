Welcome, challenger! I'm Sidney of the Elite Four.
I like that look you're giving me. I guess you'll give me a good match. That's good! Looking real good!
All right! Let's get down to the kind of battle that can happen only here in the Pokémon League!

Well, listen to what this loser has to say. You've got what it takes to go a long way!
Go on to the next room and challenge your next battle!
Yo! I've been waiting for you, Champion! With the strength you've gained, we can battle with no holds barred! Not to mention, our boy Steven sent us Elite Four some Key Stones! In other words, my Pokémon can Mega Evolve, too... Heh heh... This one's gonna be fun!
I was waiting for you, Champion. No matter who wins, no hard feelings! Let's get our most excellent battle underway!
Heh... I knew you really were the strongest... Well, hurry up and get out of here! Everybody else is still waiting for you!
