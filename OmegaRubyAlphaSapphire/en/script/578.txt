Hi! Welcome to Crooner's Café!
Songs change with the times, and the times change with songs... I wonder what kind of melody is popular now.
Please take this. You live in this time. I'm curious about what kinds of songs you sing.
Lalala... Lalala... ♪
Music is a mysterious thing. Just listening to a song I used to hear transports me back to that time.
I'm going to mesmerize people everywhere with my guitar and this Pokémon's voice.
Whiswhis...
Do you want to know a great spot in Mauville? It's Pokémon Reflexology Services, obviously. You know, everybody wants their Pokémon to be friendly toward them, right?
They say if you blend rare Berries, you'll get great Pokéblocks... However... What are rare Berries? Who in the world decides that? For instance, Cornn Berries and Magost Berries are hard to get... So if I use those, can I get great Pokéblocks?
