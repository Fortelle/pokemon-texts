I thought how you fly is by catching a whole flock of bird Pokémon, and then hanging on to them somehow. But it turns out there's an HM move called Fly! I don't know... In a way, my dream came true, but I also feel like I lost my dream... It feels really strange...
Tch... It's no good... When I ride a Bike in the tall grass, nobody can see my coolness.
Can your Pokémon use the move Secret Power to make a Secret Base out of a big pile of grass?
Do you use Detector Mode in the DexNav? Apparently, the more you encounter the same Pokémon, the better the search function will be! Its accurate search capability allows you to find rare Pokémon. They say you can find Pokémon with strange moves or rare Abilities.
