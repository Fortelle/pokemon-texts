Alilililili!
You know, I've scouted a lot of Trainers for contests. Of course, they've all been great! But... But, <var>! You're really something special! It's not just 'cause you're the 100th person I scouted, either... It's like... It's like you've got something no one else has.

I really want to know what that something is!

"Idol versus Star! A Serious, Spectacular Battle!"
The next time you take part in a Master Rank contest, <var>... Ali and I will take part, too! We... We won't lose to you! I've been doing my best as a contest idol for a long time, together with Ali. And I'm gonna use everything I've got against you, <var>!

If you and I appear in a Contest Spectacular together, the fans will love it. Most important, it will be really, really, really fun!
No holding back! Let's both give it our all!
Hm? You want something?
Where were you?
What about your idol job?
No, it's fine.
You wanna know where I've been? Well, duh! I've been getting ready so I could stand on stage with you! Tee hee! Ali and I did a ton of special training so we'd be ready to shine!

I'm still keeping up my work as an idol, of course! Just the other day I filmed a commercial for the Village Sub Combo in the TV Mauville studios! "It's the taste that'll Unov-ite the whole world! Village Sub Combo now at the Mauville Food Court!" Have you seen it? â™ª
Tee hee! It's hard to believe we've made it this far already, huh?
Alriii!
