Just when you think you're going to win, your opponent restores HP... It's such a terrible feeling... I think I'll let you see for yourself!

I should have expected no less from our Gym Leader's sondaughter. Well... That's not the whole story. A Trainer's skills are the result of effort and work. I lost to you because I didn't put in enough effort. Go on! Next is the One-Hit KO Room!
I'm going to keep training at the Gym. And one day I'll become the Leader!
