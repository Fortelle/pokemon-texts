Hello, Trainer. Would you do me a favor and trade Pokémon with me? Living in Pacifidlog, I can only catch certain kinds of Pokémon. Do you have <var>? I'll trade you my <var> for it.
Wow! This <var> is so fluffy! Since we traded, you and me, we're friends, aren't we?
That's not <var>.
I'm a little disappointed...
All right! Let's trade!
Oh! I can't trade with you because you have only one Pokémon.

Is that a Pokédex? Did you get to meet a lot of different Pokémon? I wish I was like you.
