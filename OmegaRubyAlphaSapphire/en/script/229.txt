I work for this move academy in this city. The thing is we have no students right now, and that's why I'm drinking a lot of... Fresh Water here.
Look at that! Your Pokémon already knows this move.
Ah, if only I could! I'd love to teach a move to Keldeo or Meloetta.
Let me teach a move to one of the Pokémon with you!
What a shame! Please come back if you change your mind, I beg you! I'll wait forever for you!
That's an Egg, isn't it? You can't possibly teach a move to an Egg!
That won't work! That Pokémon cannot learn the moves I can teach!
That Pokémon knows the move I can teach already!
That Pokémon's no good now. It doesn't even have the energy to battle!
<var> learned <var>!
What? <var> is...
<var> has resolved to battle and has changed into Resolute Form!
