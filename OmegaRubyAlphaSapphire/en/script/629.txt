If you are a Trainer, will you show me how you're raising your Pokémon with loving care?
Oh! You're a shy Trainer.
Which Pokémon will you show me?

Well...it's a bit hard to tell how much that Egg has grown.
Oh! This <var> was level <var> when you met. Right now it's level <var>!
Wow! This is surprising! You trained the Pokémon this much. You've raised it very well. It's received a lot of love from you.
You've raised it quite well. I feel your love for this Pokémon.
You've raised it well. I can feel a bit of love from you.
What? It has not grown at all. Still, if you travel with your Pokémon from now on, I'm sure it will grow!
You clearly make an effort to travel with your Pokémon and raise them! This is a token of gratitude for showing me your great love for your Pokémon!
<var> received a Footprint Ribbon!
<var> put the Footprint Ribbon on <var>!
This fantastic Footprint Ribbon shows the love you've given to <var>.
The number of footprints shows the amount of your love... Thank you for showing me the wonderful bond between you and your Pokémon.
Guwarrr!
Have you heard about the green-haired Gallade user everyone is talking about? They say that he's been a real hit at the Battle Maison—an absolute star! And he's racking up record after record with his carefully chosen Pokémon... My heart starts to race when I think that there might finally be a Trainer worthy of calling my rival!
You look like you'd be good at Pokémon battles. This belongs to someone like you!
The Level Release is a Decoration you can use in your Secret Base! If you set it up and activate it in your base, you'll be able to negate any level limitations in battle!
A serious battle in a Secret Base, with no limits... Don't you get excited just imagining it?
