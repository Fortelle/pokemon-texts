<var>: Team <var> has collected <var> flags so far.
<var>: Looks like you don't have your own Secret Base set up yet...
<var>: Do you need something?
<var>: I once found a good spot around <var>, but someone else had taken it. I gave up on it at the time, but maybe it's open now...
<var>: I once found a good spot around <var>... but <var> had gotten to it first!

<var>: Good battle! Come play again sometime!
<var>: Come back tomorrow!
<var>: Hmm... I don't know what it is, but I don't really feel like battling today. Can we do it some other time?
<var>: No, no, this is no good! You don't have enough Pokémon to battle!
<var>: When your party is ready, just let me know!

<var> became one of your Secret Pals!
<var>: Oh, don't tell me... You like this place, don't you?
<var>: Hmm... Well... OK! I guess I'll go and try to find a new spot!
<var> will be removed from your favorites. Are you sure you would like to continue?

Grunt: Come again tomorrow!
Grunt: <var>! But...you know what? I'm not feeling it today for some reason. I'll let you go this one time, so don't tell my boss, OK?

<var>: That's it! I just thought of something good! Let's make our own team! That's settled! We're doing it! But we've got to have a name first. <var>, what kind of name do you think is good?
<var>: Yeah? Team <var>, huh? Team <var>! Team <var>!!! <var>! It has a nice ring to it! That'll be our team name from now on! Next we've gotta think up a slogan! Let's pick a slogan for Team <var>! What would be good?
<var>: Hmm, hmm, hmm. <var>, huh? <var>! <var>!!! I've gotta drum it into myself so I don't forget it! Oh, yeah. But I'll set it up so you can always change the team's name or slogan from the PC, OK? <var>! Let's give our all to making sure that Team <var> totally rocks!
