When I was young, I traveled the world as a Secret Base Expert. Even now that I've become an old geezer, my passion has not waned. I'm waiting impatiently for a Secret Base to appear just beyond that door.

There it is! There it is! We're connected! On the other side of that door, we're connected to a Secret Base in parts unknown!
