Er-hem! Allow me to introduce myself... The Pokémon Fan Club's most important person, the chairman... ...is my older brother. I'm here enjoying my vacation with Pokémon, yes indeed.
Ah! Your Pokémon...
It's clearly very friendly toward you. A Pokémon that adoring and adorable deserves a TM like this, no?
Hmm... It's not bad, but it's also not good. You, as the Trainer, need to put in some more effort.
It has a vicious look to it. A frightening Pokémon like that deserves a TM like this.
If a Pokémon is very friendly toward you, Return's power is enhanced. If it's not friendly, Frustration's power goes up.
