Yo, wassup? Start a battle already!
Huh! Ground types? See if I care. If y'all are too scared of my Bug-type Pokémon, I'll battle with another Trainer instead!
Hey, you and your Pokémon look cool. Now be my Bug-type Pokémon's warm-up, will ya?
Y'all are so lame.
Ugh. Y'all are strong... I should've battled that Ground-type Trainer. But I won't lose tomorrow! I'll get ya for this!
Uh, uh, are you challenging me to battle, knowing I'm a Ground-type-Pokémon user?
(Yikes. This Bug-type-Pokémon user... He's rude and kinda scary...) Uh, uh, uh, unfortunately, I've already promised to battle with himer. Right?
Th-th-that's right! Let's start a battle!
Hey...hey! Please read the situation, please!
Thank you! You saved me! If something happens again, help me again.
Have you seen the sign? The Battle Resort is still popular, but there is a plan to make it a more special and robust battle facility called the Battle Frontier!
This area is always hot, so you can have hot battles anytime you want! The person who created this Battle Resort has great taste.
I usually keep my cool, but I can feel the blood pumping through my veins here.
The shining sun? The sparkling beach? Meh. Not my thing at all. The only thing I care about is the excitement of scorching-hot battles!
This place is the best! In addition to the beach surrounding the island, there's even a Pokémon Day Care!
