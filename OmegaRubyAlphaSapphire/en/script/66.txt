<var>! You're here at last! Wasn't it tough riding in the back of the bumpy moving truck all that way? Well, this is Littleroot Town. What do you think? This is going to be our new home! It has a quaint feel, but it looks like it should be a nice place to live, don't you think? And you get your own room this time, <var>! Come on. You have to see the inside!
<var>! Wait!
<var>! <var>! Did you introduce yourself to Professor Birch? Oh! What an adorable Pokémon! You got it from the professor? How nice! You are your father's child, all right... You look good together with a Pokémon!


... To think that you have your very own Pokémon now... Your father will be overjoyed. But don't push yourself too hard. If anything happens, you can always come home, honey.
To think that you can get data from the friends you pass by even when your Nintendo 3DS is in Sleep Mode! The power of science is staggering!
Professor Birch will spend days on end in his lab researching something, then he'll suddenly go out into the field to gather more data... When does he ever spend time at home?
If you step into the tall grass on the route up ahead, wild Pokémon will jump out at you!
It's not safe to go out there if you don't have any Pokémon with you.
I think I hear someone screaming up ahead! What should I do? What should we do? Somebody has to go help...
Boy, am I glad there was an intrepid guy like you around to rescue the professor.

Are you off to catch Pokémon? Good luck!

Huh?
Whoa! Are we in sync or what! You know, I was just thinking about you!
It's great to meet you! ...It is our first real meeting, right? Yeah. That's right. Of course it is!
The name's Zinnia. And you... Well, I know ALL about you. You're <var>, of course.
You're the new Pokémon League Champion! And you're one of those special few who use Mega Evolution to get even closer to their Pokémon... Now, aren't you?
Mrrr...
OK, I know, I know. I'll leave it alone. Look, I'm stopping!
But this sure is a ni-i-i-ice place, isn't it? Littleroot Town. And everybody living here is just so ni-i-i-ice, too. Like that neighbor of yours.
...Oops! So-o-o-rry. I didn't mean to go on like that. We should keep our first meeting short and sweet, don't you think? Until next time, then. Buh-bye!
Well... Bye then...
Well... Bye...

<var>!
<var>!
See you tomorrow!
See you tomorrow!
You're back at last! Welcome home, <var>!
H-help me!
