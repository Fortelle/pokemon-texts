What? What? What do you want with Team Magma? Our boss isn't here! He's gone off to steal something important! ... Where did he go? Wahaha! Do you really think I'd tell you something that crucial?

We, Team Magma, decided to make a fresh start with Maxie!

What...what...what is that Dragon-type-Pokémon user... Her strength... It's really something. By any chance, is she stronger than Maxie...?
Honestly, making a fresh start is too much of a bother and hard. But if all of us work together, we might be able to make it. Team Magma is the team that makes me feel that way.

Maxie seems to be fine for now. What a relief!
