It's not good enough yet. For a final resting place that my Pokémon Meow and I will be in, this is not good enough.
Why is he so particular about it? Once you die, everything will be gone...
A text inscribed on a tombstone honoring a deceased person or a Pokémon is called an epitaph. I've been contemplating what to write in my epitaph. I have so many great achievements that I'm at a complete loss.
The words "Final Resting Place for Pokémon Meow and Me" are inscribed on it.
