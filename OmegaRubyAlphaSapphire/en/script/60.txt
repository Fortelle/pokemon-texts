I want to take a rest, so I'm saving my progress.
Hi there! I work at the Poké Mart. From what I can see, you're a novice Trainer. Am I right? OK. Being super kindhearted as I am, I'm going to give you useful advice.
First of all, that's a Poké Mart there. Just look for our blue roof. We sell a variety of goods, including Poké Balls for catching Pokémon!
Potions can be used anytime, so they can be very useful to have.
Aaaaah! Wait! Please don't wander around here! I've just discovered a set of incredibly rare Pokémon prints! Wait until I finish sketching them, OK?

I thought I was sketching some rare Pokémon prints… It turned out they were my own footprints!
<var>! Over here! Let's hurry back to Littleroot!
I'm heading back to my dad's lab first! Come on, <var>!
Oldale Town Where things start off scarce.
And this is a Pokémon Center! Look for a red roof! Ask a woman inside, and she'll restore your Pokémon's health. That's it. That was the advice from me— the supremely kindhearted clerk. Have a great journey!
I'd like you to have these as part of a special promotion!
