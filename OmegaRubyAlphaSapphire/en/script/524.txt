Wow! It's the real <var>!
Do you know Lissi? Wow. I'm jealous. Did you shake her hand?
HShe's the real <var>! Shake my hand! Shake my hand!
Yaaaay! I'm not gonna wash my hand today!
I'm happy just being able to talk with you!
I'm sorry for you, but the person who gets the most attention in contests now is definitely Lisia. Her aura is something else.
Whoa! <var>! I didn't expect to see you! Lisia's fans don't realize how great you are! <var>, am I right? Keep showing us your Pokémon's great performance!
The most popular contest idols now are Lisia and Ali! They're incredibly strong! You seem to have potential, but compared to them, you still have a long way to go.
Ah! You're so popular... You're strong and very kind to your Pokémon. You're just perfect! I...I want to be your fan forever!
I came all the way from Kanto to see Lissi! I wonder if they'll ever make it out to my hometown.
I've become your fan! When I go back to Kanto, I'll spread the news about how great you are! So please come to my area, too!
I have no idea if you have a natural talent for performance in a contest. However! I know! I know the strongest and cutest are Lissi and Ali!
I became your fan after I saw you in the contest the other day! You seem to have gained quite a bit of popularity, I must say. However! Only I should know your true greatness. I want to keep it all to myself!
My girlfriend is super cute, but Lisia is as cute as her, too!
Whoa! <var>! Just as I imagined, you're really cool! You're great in a Contest Costume, but you look sharp in your everyday clothes, too! Oh... Don't stare at my girlfriend too much. I'm worried you may steal her heart.
Whoa! <var>! So...so cute! You're great in your Contest Costume, but you look cute in your everyday clothes, too! I like you even more!
We're Lissi's fans! I always play Lissi and Ali with my boyfriend. I play Lissi, and he plays Ali.
Yeeek! <var>! You look so cool in person, too! My boyfriend is really cool, too. But a real star's coolness is a whole different level of coolness!
Yeek! <var>! You look so cute in person, too! You're so cute that I'm worried that you may steal my boyfriend's heart! But you're so cute!
Roseli! Roseli. ♪ (It looks like it's showing off Altaria Ali's picture...)
Selia! Seliaaaaaa!! (Roselia appears to be extremely excited to see <var>...)
The person who shines the most in Hoenn is, of course, Lisia!
Whoooa! This brilliantly scintillating aura! You must be <var>! I'm so glad that I believed the rumor that I could meet you here! You shine the most in Hoenn! There's no doubt about it.
Contest Spectaculars don't interest me at all, but if I can be like Lisia, I may give it a try!
Wow, <var>! I bet you have a lot of fans—is it OK for a celebrity like you to walk around here? If pesky fans bother you, let me know. I'll protect you!
Awwwww... Lissi is too cute. I'll quit my job and follow Lissi.
Whoa! You're a celebrity! A star! If such lucky encounters keep happening to me, I'll quit my job and support <var> in every Contest Spectacular!
Oh, my dear Lisia... Please come to the Pokémon Center in my town to restore your Pokémon. I'd like to allay dear Lisia and Ali's fatigue...
My dearest <var>! I...I...I am a huge fan of yours! I've been eagerly waiting for you to come to our Pokémon Center! I have always watched you in contests, and I always will!
You have so many fans! <var>, you're a real star! We, your fan-club members, will keep supporting you forever. You're our shining star, <var>!
Um...
Li... Lissi!
Hey! It really is you, <var>! I saw you coming in here, so I wondered what was up! Tee hee! A little get-together with your fans, is it? Have fun!
