It's a machine for irradiating a Meteorite with lasers. It seems experiments were being conducted until just this moment. The surroundings of the machine smell like something burned.
PROJECT AZOTH File No. 2 We intend to analyze the power of the ultimate weapon used in Kalos 3,000 years ago and work on the development of a drill weapon utilizing the technology. The Seafloor Cavern is sealed by the power of a Legendary Pokémon. The only way to gain access to the cavern is to break the seal with power that exceeds that of the Pokémon. According to the report from the Petalburg recon team, Devon Corporation holds the secret of the technology of the ultimate weapon. We will dedicate all our resources to obtaining this technology.
It's a machine for testing the durability of the suit. Touch panels are crammed on the screen. The labels say, "Give it a walloping" "Throw a lot of weight on it" "Wring it tightly" "Drop it from really high up" "Burn it severely" "Submerge it intensely" "Thrash it hard" "Knead it massively"
"Danger! Please don't play inside." "Caution! It's super dangerous! Really! I mean it!" "If something bad happens because you didn't believe me, don't blame me!" ...That's what's written on a note tacked to the wall.
Sturdy protective gear is attached to the machine.
Beep, beep, beep. I AM AN A.I. MY PURPOSE IS TO SUPPORT THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE AQUA SUIT. THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE AQUA SUIT IS 120 PERCENT COMPLETE. CONGRATULATIONS. THE AQUA SUIT CAN WITHSTAND WATER PRESSURE AT ANY DEPTH. THE AQUA SUIT CAN WITHSTAND THE G-FORCES OF THE SECOND COSMIC VELOCITY. IT IS AN ULTRA SUPER SUIT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. HOWEVER, THE INSIDE OF THE SUIT MAY BE PERCEIVED AS SLIGHTLY HUMID AND WET. ...sorry about that... THIS CONCLUDES MY STATUS REPORT. GOOD-BYE. Beep, beep, beep.
It's a machine that controls lasers to irradiate Meteorites. Touch panels are crammed on the screen. The labels say, "Fire the laser beam delicately." "Fire the laser beam a little bit more." "Fire the laser beam fairly judiciously." "Fire the laser beam like whoa."
Meteorites... Natural energy... Super-ancient Pokémon... Here, we're conducting experiments to understand how they all relate and create a Blue Orb artificially. But...we haven't had much success. It may be too difficult for humans to solve.
The Aqua Suit is the fruit of the collaboration of Devon's and our science and technology. If not for Shelly, who used to work for Devon, the invention would never have materialized.
I'm not slacking off! I'm facing a very difficult decision. What drink to take with me on my 12-hour lookout shift— Fresh Water, Soda Pop, Lemonade...
