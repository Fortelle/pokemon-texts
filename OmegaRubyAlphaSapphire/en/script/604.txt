There's a notebook lying open on top of the desk! It looks like someone has written and erased in it over and over again.
There are pins stuck in places in the Kalos region and the Unova region.
It's the Hoenn region Town Map! There are many notes about the Pokémon that inhabit the area surrounding Petalburg City!
It's full of books about raising Pokémon and Pokémon battles! Every book is totally covered in sticky notes!
