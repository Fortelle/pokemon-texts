I'm the diving Treasure Hunter! I'm the awesome dude who goes deep-sea diving to gather treasures resting at the bottom of the seas.
Tell me, have you seen any shards of tools made in ancient times?
You haven't got any treasures for me... If you see any shards, like the Red Shard, you've got to trade them with me!
Oh hey! That... That's a shard! I'm looking for those! Oh, man, you've got to trade that to me! I'll give you something good!

You want to trade your Red Shard for my Fire Stone, right?

Oops, your Bag's full. Get rid of some items, friend!
No? That's a downer. Well, if you change your mind, come back.
