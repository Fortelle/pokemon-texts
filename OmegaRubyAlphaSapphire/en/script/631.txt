Oh my, you're a Trainer, aren't you? And you came all the way out here? I live a life free from worldly cares here, just raising Berries as a diversion.
Here, I think I'll give you one of these Berries. I hear that strong Trainers sometimes use them.
If you come again tomorrow, I'll give you whatever is ripe.
Oh my, I am sorry. But I can only harvest so many a day. Come tomorrow if you want more.
I'm gonna win 100 times in a row in the Battle Maison. But I'm not very good yet... So win 100 times in a row in my place, OK?
What? You won 100 times in a row?! That's so cool! OK, I'll give you this as a reward!
Maybe you'll win 200 in a row next... Yeah, right! Like that could happen!
Y-you won 200 times in a row! That's really, really amazing! Here, take this reward!
I'll work hard and become a strong Trainer like you!

That Gentleman is a famous Trainer in the country that he hails from. It seems like he is quite taken with you, kid!
