There's a lot to be said for living on a small island, in harmony with my Pokémon and my family.
When I married my husband, I moved here from the large port city of Slateport. Life goes by slowly on this little island. But being surrounded by the beautiful sea—that's a kind of happiness, too.
Zig-guuuh!
