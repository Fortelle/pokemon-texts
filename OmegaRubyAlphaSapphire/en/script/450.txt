It's me, Chaz the a-a-a-a-awesome! Heh! No Lisia today—too bad for you! But try not to look so disappointed. Sheesh.
Mamach! Machee?
Guess it's too bad for you, too, Macherie. You missed your chance to see Ali, huh?
Lisia's spending all her time practicing moves with Ali lately. She's waiting for you to win all the Master Rank contests. For you to become a real contest star... She says she wants to become better than ever so she can do her best performance together with you. That's why she's trying so hard. She's practically never here anymore.
She looks like she's having a lot of fun when she's practicing, though. I guess she wants to show you something that'll knock your socks off. Honestly... I really wanted it to be me.
But... If you can't win all Master Rank contests, you'll never be able to stand toe-to-toe with Lisia... But you already know that, huh? M-me, I'll never be able to stand toe-to-toe with her.
Maaah...
Cheer up, Macherie. You're my sweet and adorable girl! And that's why I'll never, ever make you do a Toughness Contest! I can't make a cutie like you try to increase your Toughness! No way!
I'm still the best rival for Lisia. I'm not wrong about that. But it doesn't mean that...well... that you haven't got a part to play, too. So, um...you know... Just take this and give it your all. Macherie, could you open the box?
Lisia's not the type to care about beating somebody else or whatever... The point is that the contest lets you show off how fantastic your Pokémon are... Guess I'm saying...well...I'm behind you, too.
Cham cham!
