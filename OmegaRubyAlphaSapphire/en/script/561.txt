Hello, and welcome to the Devon Corporation. We are the proud producers of items and medicine that enhance your life.
One of our research staff went and got robbed of something important.
Hey, that Pok√©Nav Plus! That's one of our products! It makes me happy when I see people using something we made.
That stolen case... Sure, it's important, but it's not like it would be much good to anyone else. Because those who know about the energy are... ...No! Nothing! Nothing, really! Uhahaheh...
It sounds like they've recovered the stolen Devon Parts.
I'm sorry, but only authorized people are allowed to enter.
It's beyond stupid. How could he get robbed like that?
Hi there! You're always welcome here!
