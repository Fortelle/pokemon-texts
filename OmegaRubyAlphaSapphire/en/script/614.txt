Hee hee hee... This is the Accuracy Room. It's pretty nasty when every attack lands without fail.

There are even more fearsome Trainers waiting for you ahead. The Defense Room is on the left. The Recovery Room is to the right. Whichever way you go, your Pokémon's Attack power will be on trial.
Do you know what we are trying to achieve as Trainers? We're striving to be completely in sync with our Pokémon.
