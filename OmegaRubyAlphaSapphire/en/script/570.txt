I'm Giddy. If I had friends with whom I can share the fairy tales that pour out of me, I'd be as happy as if I were frolicking in a flower garden.
People call me the Hipster. It's a true fact that there's no other man as hip as my hipness. 'Cause if there was such a rad guy, everyone would go gaga over him!
People call me the Bard. You listened to my song the other day. Do you know anybody else who wants to hear my song?
People call me the Trader. I like trading items all right, but... I'd like to share something with more energy to it.
People call me the Storyteller. We'd like to pass on our legend for the future... That's right. We'd like to share our power with someone...
People call me the Storyteller. We'd like to pass on our legend for the future... That's right. We'd like to share our power with someone... Do you know anyone?
What are you saying? There's a powerless guy across the hall? A new legend is about to be born! Would you bring him here?
Please introduce us to the guy living across the hall!
Who...who are you?
I'm Giddy.
People call me the Hipster!
The Bard am I! ♪
You could say I'm the Trader.
And, hehehe...I'm the Storyteller! Would you tell me your name?
I don't have a name to give you. If I ever had one, I forgot it a long, long time ago. I'm just hollow.
Perfect!
He seems to be a perfect candidate for receiving powers from the five of us.
Receiving powers? What do you mean? I had no idea so many people were living across the hall. Seriously, who are you?
It doesn't matter! Just hold on to your questions and rejoice that we've met!
Yeah! It's totally awesome!
Now listen! The five of us have shared O-Powers, dreams, and hopes with people all over the Hoenn region!
But we're getting old now. It's about time for us to retire.
So we've been looking for our successor. And we've found you! It's fate. You just need to pick up the torch.
That's...that's none of my business...
C'mon! You'll be filled with power and get a fresh start—a new life. It's not a bad deal...
...
Please! The world needs dreams and O-Powers!
But what... Wh-what should I do?
Will you do this? It's not difficult. The power will pour out of us and into you. Don't worry. All right? Here we go!
Being able to help one another is a wonderful thing! Thanks to you as well!
All right, let's start.
I want to travel the world over and see sunsets in every land! I urge you to visit many regions!
Eeek... Whoa!
I'm totally ready! Here we go. Peace out!
Agh...
Bear this in mind— O-Powers are art!
Ah, ah...
Our power allows people all over the world to exchange smiles! What a wonderful thing!
Yeaaah...
Now it's your turn! Become a legend! Max power!
Hey. ...Hey.
Hey!
HEY! This...this power! This power is incredible! I feel tied to these old men with such strong bonds now! I feel like a totally different man!
Hey, my friend! I'm Mr. Bonding, the expert on O-Powers! I'm a new man with a new mission! Please give my powers a try!
Let's get started, shall we? It's bonding time!
Hehe... Thanks, my friend! Now, I'm going to set off on a journey to give O-Powers to Trainers around the world! Well then, I do believe I shall take my leave. Hope to see you around! Adieu!
<var> received an O-Power.
You can now use <var>!
