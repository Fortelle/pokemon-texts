Hi. There's this Pokémon that I'm looking for. I want <var>. Do you have one? Would you trade it for my <var>?
Thank you! I'll be good to your <var>, so please be nice to my <var>!
Wait! That Pokémon isn't <var>. I guess you don't want to trade with me.
Oh, OK. If you change your mind, please come see me. I'll be waiting!
Thank you for trading with me! I really wanted this Pokémon, so I promise to take good care of it!
Sorry! I can't trade with a person who has only one Pokémon.
Trading Pokémon with others... It's as if you're trading your own memories with other people.
Pluuuuun?
