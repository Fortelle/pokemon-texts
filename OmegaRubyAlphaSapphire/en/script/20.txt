People say they've seen a Pokémon flying high in the sky above Hoenn. Is it flying around all the time? Doesn't it need to rest somewhere?
A sky Pokémon! A sky Pokémon!
Where did you come from?
Yes? Yes Town? I've never heard of a place like that.
No? That doesn't make any sense. You have to come from somewhere. Oh! Wait! You're not going to say you were born at the bottom of the sea?
...Would you take this from me? I no longer have any use for it.
That Big Stadium over in the Unova region... I always dreamed of standing on the mound there. But no matter how much I hoped and struggled, my abilities couldn't keep up with my ambitions. My dream wouldn't die, but before I knew it, I was a family man in my 50s. Not just for me, but for my family, too, it's time for me to wake up from my dream.
