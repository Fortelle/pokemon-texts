Making a large ship is more like constructing a building than assembling a vehicle.
Don't you think it's strange that a ship made of heavy iron floats? It floats because of a principle called buoyancy.







It's a blueprint of a ship that is being built. A memo on it says, "The technology of the super high-speed rail in Kalos will be used for the next-generation propulsion mechanism of this ship."

You're an adventurer, aren't you? Have you been to Sea Mauville near Route 108?
Ah-huh... Sea Mauville is a unique place. It's a building, yet it's also a natural preserve. If you seek adventure, you should go there.
I'm happy to hear that. Oh, sorry...need to introduce m'self! I'm Cap'n Salty. I used to work for Sea Mauville, and I'm still emotionally attached to that place. So I've always wanted young people to know how great Sea Mauville is.
Oh, how are you doing? The other day, I bumped into a guy who worked under me at Sea Mauville. He seemed pretty successful in his career now, but he was still apologizing for a mistake he'd made in the past. He said something like, "I'm terribly sorry that I lost the Odd Keystone." I don't remember it at all, but it made me feel nostalgic and happy.
