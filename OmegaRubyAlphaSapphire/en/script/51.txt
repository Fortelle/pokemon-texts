I wrote a theme song for those <var> schools that are popular right now. Give it a listen! Oh! <var> schools! Wonderful <var> schools!
Hmm... You should work more on your singing than <var> schools.
Man, I just can't wait for the <var> party! We have to have a really splendid party!
Yes, even the TV news might come to report on the <var> party. It's an event with a lot of history, after all.
My big brother all of a sudden quit his job and said he's going to try to become a real <var> master. What do you think? Can he make it as a professional <var> master?
Hmm, I don't know. It's hard to become a professional <var> master with a halfhearted effort. I think your big brother has what it takes to be a great <var> master, though. I'm sure he can do it!
I saw one of those <var> festivals. Jealous? The real thing was awesome!
That <var> festival wasn't real! The real one is better... Prettier... Anyway, it's just really cool!
We talked about this before, but let's have a big <var> dance party on this island!
Oh, good idea! We can decide who has the best <var> dance moves! I'll spend all my time working on my <var> dance moves from now on!
I was feeling down yesterday because I lost my wallet, but my mom cheered me up with a lovely <var> song. That <var> song touched my heart.
Ah, to be able to sing a beautiful <var> song... Your mom must be a really good singer! I'd like to hear her sing once.
Well... <var> collections aren't just a trend anymore. They feel like a part of my life now.
Is it really like that?! It's <var> collections all day every day with you! You're like some kind of <var>-collection professor!
If you and I team up, we'll be unstoppable at <var> quality!
You said it! We'll be like Team <var> Quality! Hahaha!
My dream is to save up some money to build my very own <var> house in Slateport, where I've always wanted to live. Come for a visit when it's built!
Wow, if you really build your own <var> house, it'll become a landmark in Slateport! Here's hoping you build a huge <var> house!
Pokédexes are all right, but... I think it's <var>-dexes' time now. They're worth looking into.
<var>-dexes, huh? Not bad! It's thrilling to dive into a field that no one has noticed yet. <var>-dexes will definitely be in great demand with Trainers.
