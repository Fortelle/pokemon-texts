Eheheh. My friends and I did our best in the contest, and now for some reason I feel like I have a lot more fans!
Hmmm... I was keeping my excitement to myself until yesterday, but my Pokémon and I weren't quite good enough today! Perhaps the eyes of the judges become more discerning at higher ranks.
What's that? Is it this machine next to me that you're interested in?
I just love making Pokéblocks! In the old days it used to take four of us to make a Pokéblock with this machine.
The Contest Spectacular is held in four different contest halls all over Hoenn. You can enjoy the Contest Spectacular at any of them. I always go to Lilycove, but today I feel like a change of pace.


That performance by Lisia and Ali just now was amazing!
Hey, you were really impressed, too, right? That's what you call a Spectacular Talent! Pokémon show off their talents until the excitement in the hall is at its peak. Then their allure can't be held back and comes bursting out as a Spectacular Talent!
That really was amazingly lovely! I'll give it a try, too, next time!
It's a big machine with a speed indicator and a meter.
