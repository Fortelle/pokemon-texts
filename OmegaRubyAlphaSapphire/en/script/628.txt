Hnh. You again.
I apologize for my actions earlier. The truth of the matter is... I have no idea in the world what I am doing here... Or even who I am.
The first thing of which I can remember is awakening here upon this beach. Baffled, lacking awareness of the circumstances that brought me here... And at that moment, you appeared!
I feel...as though I have some duty that I should be accomplishing... But of it, I can remember nothing.
Please, pardon me for going on about myself. In fact... I feel quite uneasy.
Of course, I must thank you for finding me.
That, I found in the pocket of my overcoat. It was the only thing I had on me. I do not know if it will prove worth anything, but I'm glad to give it to you.
Wh-who am I? Who in the world am I?
Poor man. It seems he has amnesia.
