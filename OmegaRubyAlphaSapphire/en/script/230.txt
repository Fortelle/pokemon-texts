Hmm... Do you want me to teach Dragon Ascent to your Pokémon?
Hmm... Only Rayquaza can learn Dragon Ascent. You don't seem to have one.
Hmm... I see. Come back anytime you need my help.
Which Pokémon do you want me to teach the move?
That Pokémon can't learn Dragon Ascent. Only Rayquaza can learn the move.
Ohoho! Do you want me to teach the move to the Egg? You youngsters sure know how to joke.
That Rayquaza has already learned Dragon Ascent.
Do you want me to teach <var> to the <var>?
Dragon Ascent is a powerful move that only Rayquaza can use. They say its power is so strong that even a huge meteoroid can be broken into pieces with one attack. Well, you must know best about how fierce it is, though.
