Wallace, this city's Gym Leader, is a powerful Trainer. The best in the whole Hoenn region, people say. But the Elite Four and the Champion are said to be even stronger! How strong could they be?
The whole town has taken refuge, and nobody will leave their home. This weather... Could it be the prelude to something? People were mentioning an old legend or something...
Whenever, wherever, and whatever happens, I will always be friends with my Pokémon. Because it's fun to be with Pokémon!
I don't know why... But...I'm really scared... Mmn. I think I'll watch some BuzzNav and calm myself down...
Aha! Pokémon Journal During sandstorms or hail, wild Pokémon protect themselves by going underground with Dig or diving deep into the sea with Dive.
