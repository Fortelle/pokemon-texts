When all that mountain climbing has made you tired, try Lava Cookies. They're Mt. Chimney's local specialty. Try one. They're just $200.
Thank you, dear!
Oh, dear. You can't buy a thing if you've not got the money.
Oh, fine then.
But you can't carry any more Lava Cookies.




This mysterious machine... It gives no response whatsoever.
The power contained in the Meteorite...
If we merge the explosive energy contained within the planet's core with the Meteorite's power...
I remember those eyes. And the indomitable will that seems to burn behind them. Ahhh. Now I recall. You are the one who defied us at Slateport's Oceanic Museum. And, your presence here tells me that you have defeated Tabitha. Yes, I see now that the stirring of interest I felt was not misplaced. Hmph. You show true promise. Fine. I will attempt to educate you.
Thousands of years ago, there lived a most powerful being that was said to be capable of creating new lands on the planet. The power which we in Team Magma seek— This power, which can expand the available landmass, belongs to a legendary and super- ancient Pokémon. Though now it slumbers, having lost the source of its power and been trapped in a deep sleep.
So what is it that we must do to awaken this slumbering giant? Our research has led us here, to Mt. Chimney. Yes, here...to this very Meteorite. If we create the right conditions, we should find ourselves able to alter this Meteorite's qualities. Yes, even into a Mega Stone. Even into a Key Stone. And here, at Mt. Chimney— Hmph... I should not say too much. That is the end of today's lesson.
Now then. I believe it is time we begin. The time for the purge has come. I do believe that I made myself quite clear when we were last in Slateport. I warned you that any fool standing in our way would be met without mercy!
I will bury you by my own hand. I hope you appreciate this honor!

Oh? So you repulsed the great Maxie in battle. Haha... You never fail to entertain me!
An excellent start! This time, permit me to unleash my full strength! Once you've tasted my Pokémon's Mega Evolved power, you will say good-bye to your last shred of hope!
Hm?
Yes, it's me. ... Oh? Then it is Mt. Pyre.
I understand. I will come at once.
I am sorry to cut our battle short, but I'm afraid I must excuse myself. Such rudeness demands reparation. Take this Meteorite with my apologies. You may do with it what you like.
And I will not again forget the face of the Trainer who managed to thwart me in battle!
Huh? If it ain't that little scamp! But blast that Maxie! He just escaped us!
And he just left behind the Meteorite that he's been crazy about finding?
Hyahyahya?! It's you! You're the one who tried to interrupt me, Tabitha, at Meteor Falls!
D-d-do you intend to get in my way once more? Unngh! You're really...
really, really, really, really, really, really...
really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really...
reeeallllyyyyy... ...an obnoxious child, aren't you?!
Ahh... Ahh...
I will...crush you. So that you...never get in my way...again.

I knew you would be strong.
What a shame, though! The Meteorite we got from Professor Whoever is already in our Boss's hands! Where's the Boss, you ask? Ah, yes, yes, right this way! Oh, I do hope that you can be shown Team Magma's true power!
Ahya! Ahyahyahyahya!
The Boss is right this way! Oh, I do hope that you can be shown Team Magma's true power!



That annoying Team Aqua... They always mess with our plans!
Meteorites pack amazing power!

Stay out of our way, OK? We're trying to enlarge the landmass for the good of everybody!
Yeah! Douse them in fire!
Go! Stomp Team Aqua! And expand the land!
Pwump!
Pwump!
Pwump!
Pwump!
Pwump!
Pwump!
Get out of my blasted way, ye scurvy Team Magma knaves! Or face a keelhauling!
Confound the lot of you! Let me through, you bilge rats!
Oh no... Team Magma outnumbers us! We can't keep up with them!
If they expand the land, there'll be fewer habitats for Water Pokémon!
Team Magma wants to expand the landmass. How's that for insane?
Pfloosh!
Pfloosh!
Pfloosh!
Pfloosh!
Pfloosh!
Pfloosh!
The great swell of power that sleeps deep in the magma...
And it's the key to controlling the super-ancient Pokémon's power?
Ah! You... Uh... No... Oh! Now I know how I know you! You're the little scamp that got in our way in Slateport's museum! If you made it here to me, you musta swept right past Shelly, huh? Heh...heheheh... Krmph! Bwahahahahaha! I figured you were a big deal the first time I laid eyes on you, but...whoa!
Heheh. Well, since you are the real deal, I s'pose I could let you in on just what's going on. See, this Meteorite that I just got from good old Professor High-an'-Mighty back there... With the right bit of work, it seems we could turn it into a real nice, valuable bit. Like maybe a Mega Stone. Or maybe...even a Key Stone. And as long as we're here at Mt. Chimney...
Hyup! Bwahahahahah! Look what I nearly went an' did! If I give away all my secrets, all the thrill'd be gone from our relationship! I think I'll just leave you hanging here.
Well... It's not the details that matter any old how. We've got a thing we gotta do, ya see. From our point of view, scamp, you're a dirty villain who's gotten in our way one time too many. I'm still leader of Team Aqua, so I'm afraid it's the rope's end for you and your Pokémon.
Now come!

Heheheh. Ya little scamp! I knew you were the real deal!
Brilliant! Then my team won't hold back this time! Mega Evolution, how I've missed you! It's been ages since we got to let loose!
Tch. Scamp, I'm gonna have to ask you to hold that thought. I've gotta use my time-out.
Huh? That you, Matt? You have the worst timing— What? Hoh! So Mt. Pyre's the real— Got it. Guess that orb's not just some fairy tale after all!
All right! I'm on my way!
Sorry, scamp. When you're a grown-up, y'see, sometimes things crop up. Gotta put our battle on hold till next time. Take this. Should help keep ya busy till we settle the score. Have fun with it, hey?
Let's meet again somewhere. I'll be sure to remember that face.
I've seen you before, child. It seems you are not to be trifled with, if you repelled Archie in battle.
What is that fool up to now? He abandoned the Meteorite that he sought so persistently?
What are you doing here?!
Did you follow us all the way here from Meteor Falls?! Ha! Well hey, good job, kid.
OK. I admit it.
You are quite the Trainer. And...
To Archie... me... and all of Team Aqua, your existence is annoying!
The world Archie dreams of would be a utopia for Pokémon. I can't let you get in the way of someone who's pushing on toward a perfect world!
Prepare yourself! This will finally be the time that I leave that cute face of yours swollen and crying!

Uh. Are you telling me you've upped your game even more since last time?
You're a brat with a bright future...
My Pokémon and I don't have any strength left to fight... Go on... Go and be destroyed by Archie.
Go on... Go and be destroyed by Archie.



That annoying Team Magma... They always mess with our plans!
Meteorites pack amazing power!

Stay out of our way, OK? We're trying to enlarge the sea for the good of Pokémon!
All right! If three of us work together, we can even stop the Team Magma Leader!
All right! Drench 'em!

Ugh! Impudent fools! You Team Aqua curs dare to impede the great Maxie?!
Impertinent...little...imbeciles!
Oh no... Team Aqua outnumbers us! We can't keep up with them!
If they expand the sea, there'll be fewer habitats for Pokémon and people!
Team Aqua wants to expand the sea. How's that for insane?

↓ Jagged Pass Direction of Lavaridge Town















You there! You're covered in ash. Don't you look worn out for being so young?
If you keep going on down this mountain route, there's a place called Lavaridge Town. You should rest before you go.
The energy contained within Mt. Chimney! And the power of the Meteorite! We in Team Aqua are gonna get it all for ourselves! Wa ha ha ha!
The energy contained within Mt. Chimney! And the power of the Meteorite! We in Team Magma are gonna get it all for ourselves! Wa ha ha ha!
Can't be—! Could he have found out where the real orbs are hidden?!
That sneaky little scientific so-and-so! I'm always left watching his bony backside run two steps ahead of me!
No! Could it be possible that he has confirmed the existence of the orbs at last?
Ngh! Again, I find myself outmaneuvered. What a terrible miscalculation!
I suppose there's no helping it. Once a Pokémon Center girl, always a Pokémon Center girl! I'll have your Pokémon in tip-top shape in a jiffy!
Your team's health was restored!
