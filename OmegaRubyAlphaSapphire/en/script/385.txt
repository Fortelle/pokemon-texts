Ah! <var>!
I bet you must be surprised to see me in a place like this!
That promise that we made back then... Thank you for keeping your end of it.
It was really all thanks to you that I could make it this far, <var>.
It was only because I lost to you back then that I could become even stronger.
I'm sure that you and your Pokémon must have had to overcome a lot, too... To make it all the way here. Right, <var>?
Everyone's grown so much...
And now we'll finally get to see just what we all can do. Standing here facing you again gives me chills...
...But I won't give up! I won't lose anymore.
My Pokémon have given me the courage and strength to fight. I have to win for their sake!
So get ready... Here I come!

... ...
Arghhh!!!
... ... ...Hah.
<var>, you... And your Pokémon, too... Thank you for not holding back when you battled against us... For not holding back when you beat us...
And... Gallade... Everyone... Thank you so much...
I feel like I've been able to take another step forward thanks to you!
I couldn't beat you this time, <var>. But I'll stay here and continue training. And one day... Look out! I swear I'll catch up to you one day! When I do, promise we'll battle again! That's a promise I intend to live up to!



Oh! I know! I'll give you this to keep. I hope it will always remind you of your battle with me...and with Gallade and the rest of my team.
If you have a male Kirlia as one of your partners, <var>, I hope that you might use that Dawn Stone on it for me.
