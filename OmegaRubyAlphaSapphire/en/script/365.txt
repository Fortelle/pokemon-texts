Isn't this place fun? I get chills just being here! And there are rumors about an awesome Pokémon living here!
Sniff, sniff... Just as I thought, a rare Pokémon must be hiding somewhere in this abandoned building. Girls are very sensitive to smell, so I know.
When I was young, I worked here. Even though it was closed for Pokémon's sake, looking at my old workplace deteriorating like this gives me mixed feelings.
Ah... I can't go farther... If my Pokémon knows the move Dive, I might be able to go farther.
Oh! You have Dive! I have my inner tube, so I can't dive. Ahaha.
Oh! You have Dive! I have my inner tube, so I can't dive. Ahaha.
The door is locked. It has "Room 1" written on it.
The door is locked. It has "Room 2" written on it.
The door is locked. It has "Room 4" written on it.
The door is locked. It has "Room 6" written on it.
<var> used the <var>! The key stuck fast in the keyhole, but the door opened!
Hey! Little kid over there!
I came here 'cause my uncle told me that there are extraordinary treasures in this abandoned building. Don't you know anything about them? Well, how would you know... But if you learn anything, tell me, kid. Understand?
I wonder how extraordinary the extraordinary treasures are. Hehehe... I'm excited like a kid in a candy store.
It's a perfect place for exploration, so I'm really excited! Rumor has it that there are awesome treasures here!
I don't know what it is for, but I found a key! I don't know what it is for, but do you want this?
Here it is!
Don't be shy. Take this!
I wonder what the key is for. It's exciting. If you find out, please let me know.
So that was the Key to Room 1! I couldn't read what was written on it. Once you find out what it is, it's a tad disappointing, isn't it? Give me back the excitement!
I heard this place used to collect something called e-n-e-r-g-y.
Sniff, sniff... Yes, yes! I can smell it. You must have met or caught a rare Pokémon around here, right? But this smell... It's different from the smell of any Pokémon in the Hoenn region.
