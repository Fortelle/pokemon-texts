That Rusturf Tunnel there... At first, we had a huge crew working on boring through the rock with the latest machinery. But we had to stop. Turns out we would have had a negative effect on wild Pokémon in the area. So we're left lazing around here doing nothing!
There's a man who dug his way to Verdanturf all by his lonesome. He was desperate to get through. He says that if you dig little by little without using machines, you won't disturb Pokémon, and you'll avoid harming the natural environment.
To get to Verdanturf without using this tunnel, you'd have to cross the sea to Dewford, sail on to Slateport, and then travel through Mauville.
Did you hear? The tunnel to Verdanturf has gone through! Sometimes, if you hope strongly enough, dreams do come true.
