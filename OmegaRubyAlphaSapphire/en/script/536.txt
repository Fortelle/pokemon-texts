The tree houses of Fortree are great! I think it's the number-one town for living together with Pokémon.
Pokémon and people have adapted to nature to survive. There's no need to make nature conform to the way we want to live.
Zzzt!
Climbing up and down... Living here is a ticket to health, hey? Why don't you use this to stay in shape, too?
My house is on a tree, so maybe I should build a Secret Base by the sea.
