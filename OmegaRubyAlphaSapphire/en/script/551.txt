Do you nickname your Pokémon? I gave a cool name to mine. But when I call my Pokémon by that name, people laugh at me... If it's OK with you, want to trade your <var> for my <var>?
Hee hee hee, ooh, this is so exciting!
But that's no <var>. Tsk. So disappointing.
Aww, it's a good Pokémon...
Don't you get curious about what other people named their Pokémon?
Ah! You only have one Pokémon. Sorry, I can't trade with you.
In all sorts of places, there are all sorts of Pokémon and people. I find that fascinating! It inspires me to go to all sorts of places.
