PROJECT AZOTH File No. 1 The goal of Project AZOTH is to return the world— return everything—to the beginning. In order to further the project, we must proceed with research on Kyogre's Primal Reversion. Primal Reversion is a potential of Pokémon Evolution, a potential different from Mega Evolution. Mega Evolution is made possible by the energy of people and Pokémon. Primal Reversion is made possible by natural energy. In Primal Reversion, Kyogre absorbs natural energy into its body, thereby increasing its power dramatically. Both states significantly enhance Pokémon's power: the difference lies in the source of the required energy.

There's a bed. Let's take a rest.
