Oh! <var>! I'm sorry everything is so cluttered. When I get engrossed in research, things end up this way. This is embarrassing—please keep this a secret in exchange for this.

It's Lanette's research notes. There's information about Boxes. Design Boxes to hold 30 Pokémon each. Each Trainer should be able to store 900 Pokémon on the PC system. Keep reading?
A marking system should be added to make organizing Boxes easier. The name and wallpaper design of each Box will be made changeable. Keep reading?
When storing a Pokémon, it should be sent to the Box inspected last. If that Box is full, the received Pokémon is stored in the next Box. In other words, when a Box is examined, it is automatically selected as the Box to which Pokémon are sent.
<var> closed the notebook.
There's an email from someone on the PC. "... Your Storage System is quite convenient. It has a lot of user-friendly features that make it fun and useful, too. It makes me proud that I played a part in its development. Here's hoping that you'll continue research in Storage Systems. ..."
Complicated math formulas are displayed on the monitor.
Something that looks like letters is written on it, but it's so messy and not legible.
Oh, <var>. You want to organize your Boxes in the PC more efficiently, don't you?
Oh, I see. I thought it was a simple deduction.
That's what I thought. How I arrived at that conclusion is a simple deductive process. ...Just because you took the trouble to talk to me.
Then please wait for a while.
It's done. I set up "Organize Boxes" at the top of the menu in the PC. If you want to return it to normal, please talk to me again.
Oh, <var>. You want to return the order of the menu in the PC back to normal, don't you?
Now, it's done. I returned the order of the menu in the PC back to normal. If you want to move "Organize Boxes" to the top of the menu, please talk to me again.
