Umm... If this goes here, and that goes over there... Then where does this thing go? And what about that doohickey? Aaargh! I can't make heads or tails of this!
Oh, sorry. I'm Dock. Captain Stern commissioned me to draw up designs for a ferry. Oh! Those parts you have... Those are the Devon Parts! But...hmm... This won't do... I guess Captain Stern is probably off at the Oceanic Museum again... Sorry, but could I ask you to find the captain and give the parts to him?
I guess Captain Stern is probably off at the Oceanic Museum again... Sorry, but find the captain and deliver the parts directly to him!
Shipbuilding is an art. A lot of things can't be figured out by calculations on paper. I really could use some advice from a veteran sailor who knows the seas...
Hey! Mr. Briney agreed to join us and lend us his knowledge and expertise. The help of a legendary sailor means the ferry plans are really coming together!
It's finally ready! Our new ferry, the S.S. Tidal, is truly a marvel of technology! But I get the feeling we can make something better yet. You know, there's never an end to technology's onward march.
Ah, my ladlassie! It's been too long! Since helping youâ€”well, you got this ol' seadog wanting to sail the seas again! So I decided to help Dock make a ferry! After all, I'll be able to take even more people across the sea in a ferry! But, you know, Dock is really something special. With his knack for technology and my experience of sailin', together we can build one great ship, for certain!
Pii kweee!
The seasons, the weather, where the moon sits in the sky... These and other conditions make the sea change its expression. That's right! The sea is like a living thing!
I get seasick real easily. So I get to help out here instead.













I'm working here.
Hm? You...
