Your elevator don't go all the way to the top, songirl? Can't have no Rotation Battle without three Pok√©mon at least.
Naw... I don't want ary of no battlin'... Just can't work up no hunger for it, nohow. And you look like you ain't much to reckon with anyway. Get on with you, now!
Aw, come on, Gran! HShe bothered to come all the way out here. And a little battling does a body good!
Consarn it... Well, I suppose I might could... Can't see what all the commotion's about, but since it's my own kin doing the asking...
Oh, of all things... We done? I'm plumb tuckered out now...
Thanks for showing Gran a good time. Why don't you take this for your trouble?
Consarn it. I'm feeling weak as all get-out. You go and get yourself on home now, songirl.
It's like this. My old granny used to be a fearsome Trainer. She was known as the Rotation Fiend! But ever since we lost Granddad, she's lost that old spark of hers... Now all the neighborhood scamps are calling her the Rotation Frump.
Gow! Gow-ow!
Oh, are you going to battle with Mom? What a sweet young Trainer you are! I know she'll enjoy it to bits, but of course she is getting up in years... She really can't manage more than one battle a day. You understand, don't you?
