Hahaha!
I'm Phoebe of the Elite Four.
I did my training on Mt. Pyre. While I trained there, I gained the ability to commune with Ghost-type Pokémon.
The bond I developed with my Pokémon is extremely tight.
Come on! Just try and see if you can even inflict damage on my Pokémon!

There's definitely a bond between you and your Pokémon, too. I didn't recognize that fact, so it's only natural that I lost.
Yup, I'd like to see how far your bond will carry you.
Go ahead. Move on to the next room.
Ahaha! I've been waiting for you! I'm bringing a little something new to the table this time! Prepare yourself and bring it on!
Hmmp, what a shame. I lost again, huh? But on the bright side... We fought together, so the bonds between my Pokémon and me got even deeper! I look forward to being able to battle you again sometime!
