I was away awhile, so I was surprised to see there is an exhibit on the second floor, too. I wish someone would paint my Pokémon this pretty.
Well...this is where they display the paintings that everyone has been talking about recently. I see. These new paintings are indeed full of vigor and are fascinating.
Wow, is that right? The models of portraits here are your Pokémon. Isn't that just the ultimate joy for a Trainer?
I think I saw the contest when this portrait was painted! I always watch your contests, though. Thank you for always giving me such a fun time!

Oh, it's you! I'm the curator here. Do you remember me? As I promised, I displayed your Pokémon's portrait art here! Yes, just as I imagined, the modern touch is pretty good, too.
Thanks to you, new styles have been added to this museum. I'm happy about that.
By the way... Thanks to you, we were able to display so many portraits. Let me thank you properly.
The past, the present, and the future... I'd like to collect all kinds of marvelous art here in Lilycove Museum!
It looks like a place to display a portrait of a Pokémon that performed well in a contest.
This is a portrait of <var>, which performed well in the <var> Contest!
