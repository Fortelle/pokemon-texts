You've come all the way to look at herbal medicine in Lavaridge? That's rather commendable! I like you! Take this!
That Charcoal I gave you is used for making herbal medicine. It can also do wonders when held by a Pokémon. It powers up Fire-type moves!
Herbal medicine works impressively well. But your Pokémon will dislike you for it. It must be horribly bitter!
The display reads: The more bitter it tastes, the better it works!
