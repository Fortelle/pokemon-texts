Berries grow on trees that thrive only in soft soil. If you take some Berries, be sure to plant one in soft soil. A planted Berry will soon sprout, grow into a plant, flower beautifully, and then grow Berries again. I want to see the whole wide world filled with beautiful flowers. That's my dream.
Please help me, <var>. Plant Berries, and bring more flowers into the world.

Flowers bring so much happiness to people, don't they?
Hello! Flowers will bloom beautifully and bear many Berries if you take good care of them. You'll like tending flowers, I'm sure. You can have this.
While Berry plants are growing, water them with the Wailmer Pail. Oh, another thing. If you don't pick Berries for a while, they'll drop off onto the ground. But they'll sprout again. Isn't that awesome? It's like they have the will to live.
I'm trying to be like my big sisters. I'm growing flowers, too! Here you go! It's for you!
You can plant a Berry to grow more Berries, or you can have a Pokémon hold it. But now there's a machine that mixes up different Berries to makes candies for Pokémon. ...I want some candy, too.
Flowers of various colors are blooming. They smell wonderful...
Select "Berries" on your AreaNav, and you can check the places where you planted Berries.
And when the Berry plants sprout Berries, Berry symbols will be shown on the Berry list on your AreaNav. So I recommend you check it often.
