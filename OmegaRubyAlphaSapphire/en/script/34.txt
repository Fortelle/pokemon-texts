My papa told me this tunnel is full of timid Pokémon that get all scared of loud noises and make a big uproar! So they had to stop the big tunnel project, but there's one man who's still trying to dig the tunnel by himself!
There was a man who dug a tunnel for a lady he loved. That's really kind of amazing!
With the way the winds blow, volcanic ash is never blown in this direction. That means that the air is clean and delicious here! It could surely do wonders for the frail and sickly.
I've been feeling pretty confident about the cuteness of my Pokémon. So I came here to make its presence felt in the Contest Spectacular!
See that cave by the Poké Mart? There's a guy in there who's trying to bust up boulders so he can bust through to the other side. It'd be great if we could get through... Then it'd be real easy to visit Rustboro!
We can finally pass through that tunnel next to the Poké Mart! It's great! It's easy to go shop for new Devon products in Rustboro now!

My Shroomish got lost... It disappeared around the sign. Where did it go?
Ah! Mushew! Thank you for finding my Shroomish! I'll give you this. I just found it. It has a strange shape and it looks amazing.
