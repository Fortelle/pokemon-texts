Oh?!
Hey, if it ain't my new pal! You been doin' good?
I'm doing great of course! I'm totally pumped about the Secret Spot I discovered here! You wanna see it, too? It's right back there... Past that big boulder behind me! A Secret Spot protected by a boulder like that has gotta be full of adventure! And here! Have a little gift from me, since I'm in such a fine mood today!
That move there will change its effect based on where you are. And more important, doesn't it have an awesome name? Welp, I guess it's time for me to be off lookin' for another location for a Secret Base. I hate to say good-bye, but this is it for today, pal! If you wanna see me again, come by the Secret Base Guild in Fortree!
