The Pokémon League is just beyond Victory Road. If you've come this far, what choice do you have but to keep going?
The long and harrowing trip down Victory Road... It's like reliving the path one has traveled in life...
You! Young manlady! Believe in your Pokémon and take your best shot!
Aha! Pokémon Journal If you use Trick Room after Trick Room is used, the Pokémon with the higher Speed stat can attack first again.
The Victory Road is the place where many strong Trainers gather from all over the world. They use Pokémon from other regions as well as from Hoenn, so we can't let our guard down even for a second!
